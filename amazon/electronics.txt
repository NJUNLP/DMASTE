5 #### I have owned these for roughly a couple of weeks , but i have never had any issues with any other Netgear switches that I have bought in the past .
5 #### This arrived in a timely fashion and worked as advertised .
5 #### We tried to watch old tapes and could only see static . Used the cleaning tape and it looked like new .
4 #### I admittedly did n't see the sound byte of the horn until now , and if I had heard it earlier , I would have thought differently . I installed this to have a lower , and hopefully louder tone in my horn . The factory horn was lower though . I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now , so on an Isuzu Trooper , it is a little pathetic . I blame this on myself though , and I realize the product is good for its intended audience . Just do n't buy this if you havea truck ! The look of this horn , if you have it visible , is a plus , and the shipping and installation were a breeze .
5 #### keeps things nice and clean while putting oil in the bike .
5 #### fits well and is being wind tested in california as i type this . Wish they where a bit wider so I can have my window down a bit more though . clean and dry very good , the area you plan on sticking the 3 m tape too ! do n't put it on a dirty car .... keeps the wind out of girls hair lol ! After high winds here in southern California I can definitely say these will hold up very well have not had flapping when doing 90 in my truck nor have they come loose when offroad which I do bi weekly not heavily though . Just some Mudd and rocks
1 #### Comfortable . In a very short time the material has broken and the wire is showing . Not durable . Not worth it .
5 #### I purchased this on 10/22/12 so I could plug in my headphones into my computer at work . The CPU is located just a bit too far for the cord on my headphones , so this allows me to use my headphones at work instead of purchasing ANOTHER pair . The sound quality is just as good as without . The only thing I wish is that the package said that you had to push to snap your headphones into the connector . At first , I thought my headphones would n't work . Then I tried to push the headphones gently into the connector .
4 #### Purchased it for my son . He says it is a very good rapid charger . I already have a model for my phone .
5 #### This works really great holding nuts in place to keep them from vibrating loose . This is the softest of the Loctite threadlockers so it is easier to take apart when you need to . I use it on bolts that I know I will have to take loose again . It works great . I also use it on plastic parts since it is gentler than the others .
5 #### I 've had several muffler combo 's on my hot rod 55 Chevy ... I ended up with these Dynomax mufflers to avoid the dreaded Flowmaster drone ( especially on the 40 series ) . I replaced the Delta 50 's ( which were actually not too bad compared to the 40 's ) .. and I can report great results . With no compromise in performance ( some will say they flow as good as an open header ) , the Dynomax Super Turbo 's have a decent rumble , little to no drone , yet they 'll bark when you hit the loud peddle . I 'm running 2 1/2 " pipes , a " H " cross - over pipe and full length tailpipes .
4 #### My truck is a 2001 Chevy Silverado extended cab with 5.3l v8 and 4 wheel drive with 146,000 miles on it . The K&N 57 - 3021 - 1 Fuel Injection Performance Kit Gen2 Air Intake Kit was a quality product and took about 90 minutes to install . I had more trouble getting the old air filter housing , air box and air mass sensor off than I did putting the K&N on . I did have to shave a small amount of fan housing off to eliminate a too close fit but that was minor . The results were oustanding . Prior to installation , towing our 2011 Jayco Jay Feather Ultralite 197 at 4000 lbs loaded was laboreous and a bit leisurely , 55 mph being the best I could hold and 2nd gear up most grades . After installation , the engine feels less labored and hard at work with lots more power and in conjunction with a Hypertech progammer , I can now hold 55 mph easily and in overdrive , and it feels much better with more power and 3rd gear up grades . Our gas mileage , observed over several tanks over grades and mountain passes going to our favorite campgrounds , has gone from 10 mpg to 13 mpg . The K&N was well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone .
5 #### This little guitar has a nice , warm tone and plays nicely . The color of the laminate is also really appealing . It plays smoothly and is n't too big for me to play it . The fret board is small enough for me to move my tiny little baby hands around , so if you have larger hands , I would n't recommend it . Love it ! Her name is Gladys and I 've had her for about two years and no complaints !
5 #### The case is made of high quality leather with quality stitching . It 's the type of high end case that normally retails for 24.99 to 29.99 from a name brand manufacturer . If you 're considering this case for something other than a Palm device , rest assured it WILL fit the AT&T 8525 or TILT just fine . In fact , if you look at the pictures , it 's a perfect fit . The shipping on this item was reasonable and quick and the price for it is unbeatable . You ca n't get this high quality a case at those mall kiosks that will still sell for $ 12 ~ $ 17 anyway .
4 #### I know you get what you pay for , but for a $ 200 piece of glass I expected a little more . The max aperture of f/4.0 has n't bothered me yet , but I have n't had the chance to put it to its fullest yet . I 'm glad I bought this lens , but I wish lenses were n't so expensive because for a 16 year old I ca n't really afford the thousand dollar lenses . I definitely recommend the use of a monopod , or tripod because hand holding this on the 300 side is almost impossible to get a clear shot unless your shooting over 1/200 at Least . Plus at 300 it gets considerably darker because of the changing of the aperture to 5.6 . Also if you focus on a subject at 75 then zoom to 300 the subject becomes blury which is really annoying if you 're manual focusing .
5 #### test leads are perfect for experimenting with . I use them also in my alarm business . when i need to connect my programming keypad to the alarm panel these allow me to quickly clamp on to the screw terminals without having to use a screwdriver .
5 #### Had no problems , looks stylish . If you have an original Nook Glowlight ya ought to get this for your device .
5 #### These are my son 's favorite reeds . So far , they have worked better than any brand -- fairly good percentage of " good " reeds in a box , and last a decent amount of time .
5 #### The GMC Logo Easy Fit Mud Guards are definitely what I need to protect my truck from tar , stone chips , dirt , mud and any other muck I happen to encounter in my on road and off road adventures . I attempted to install them myself but found it necessary to have them installed at the dealership . The forty dollar fee was well worth it as it took almost an hour and a half for the installation . They had to remove the tires to properly align and fasten the mud guards . The price was right and the deal was made even sweeter thanks to Amazon 's free shipping but be aware you might have to pay for them to be properly installed . ~ The Boss BRAIN DRAIN ADD ON : Why did n't I think to simply turn the tires outward then use my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Black - and - Decker - PD600 - Pivot - Plus-6 - Volt - Nicad - Cordless - Screwdriver - with - Articulating - Head / dp / B0000C6DXE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Black and Decker PD600 Pivot Plus 6 - Volt Nicad Cordless Screwdriver with Articulating Head</a>&nbsp;to fasten them myself ? It might have worked ! Try it and see before spending extra for installation . ~ The Boss
4 #### Now that I have learned that you must give the printed tape a quick , hard pull in the built - in slot to separate the tape from the backing , this is a big favorite . Very convenient for making labels in a variety of formats . i use it on TV wires , tool drawers , AC adapters ( which goes with what ? ) , and reading - glass cases ( 1.25 or 2.50 ? ) . Also file tabs . You will think of more .
5 #### Good deal , and Belkin cables have always worked well for me .
3 #### I was minutes away from ordering this phone on Amazon . It looks amazing . Trouble is , it does not have the proper 3 G antennas for United States 3 G ( AT&T ) . So you will only get EDGE speeds unless you are out of the US ( Europe , etc ) . Everything else on the phone will work just fine , but 3 G will not . Just a heads up if you missed the mention of no USA 3 G in the description . I just got the N95 - 4 instead so I could have 3G. The camera on the N82 is much better , but I ca n't stand EDGE data . Too slow . If you are on T - Mobile in the states , or do n't care about 3 G , the N82 is the phone to get !
2 #### There are n't many case options available for the Lumia 800 . I purchased this to replace the previous case I lost , merely looking for something better . I was to say the least , disappointed , and ended up removing the case after a few days and re - buying my previous case . Pros : Looks good Cons : Extremely hard to put on . If you have a full body shield on your phone , it can peel off while removing the case . Too hard , I ca n't imagine this case absorbing much of the shock if the phone was dropped . Buttons become excessively hard to push , also due to how hard the case is . Conclusion : If all you are just want to prevent scratches , and you do n't mind buttons being hard to press , this case might work for you , but if that 's the case , I would buy one of the < $ 2 ( shipped ) silicone cases . If you want something that actually protects your phone , I felt much more comfortable using the Tire Tread case by igadgitz . Not only is it a thicker soft rubber that will protect my phone if I drop it , the tread design makes the case extra grippy so it does n't randomly slide out of my pocket or off a table .
3 #### The Motorola H720 Bluetooth headset is okay , for the price . Sometimes people ca n't hear me clearly , but it is comfortable and light weight on my ear . The clarity needs to be improved , if that can be done . Motorola needs to bring out an updated verison that improves the clarity .
5 #### Great fit for my 67 Sheraton ! Plush inside and made well !
5 #### Perfect for lower tuning , if you want to keep your high strings easily bendable and your low strings better controlled .
5 #### This HDMI cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my HDTV . Being told that it is n't necessary to spend outrageous money on HDMI cable has proven true . I now have several inexpensive HDMI cables that work perfectly . I would purchase additional cables from this seller in the future .
5 #### I do n't need space for but one camera and this fits all my camera and charger and strap along with its manual and small collapsible tripod . very happy with this purchase
5 #### Installed it in my RZR 1000 . I have 2 of these running a TON of audio equipment . I had one go bad , but I was able to return it to a local authorized dealer for a swap . Love my odyssey batteries .
4 #### Fits my 2000 dodge ram well but needed slight modification of tabs and one was broken off in the package . Only a minor tab so it works .
1 #### I have not received this part of this three part order . There has been shipment , but I have not received the two items as of this date . Please investigate and reship .
5 #### I purchased these for a better option to carry and store my walkies and they work great . The walkies are held securely and protected well .
5 #### I had to use my wife 's 01 Honda Accord for a couple of days and I could hardly hear myself think from the road noise made by the tires on concrete . I searched around and found several products offering claims of noise reduction . I figured if this was good enough for the " King of cool cars " Chip Foose , then It would probably be good enough for me . I put it on the doors and the floor boards . It was fairly easy to do , get some of those nylon interior tools so you do n't scar up the interior panels . Man , was I ever a smart guy . My wife had never realized how loud it was in her car until I installed this . Now she is happy as ever driving her car . She said it made it feel like a new car . Happy wife - happy life . This stuff really does help a bunch ! And to think , I did this for me ... and reaped the benefits for doing it for her . Thanks to Chip and Amazon ( for having the best price and free shipping ) ! I would have given it a 6 out of 5 if I could .
5 #### This cord was exactly what I was looking for . The cord I was using for my iphone broke , and it was because I had tripped on it~ a result of the cord being too short . This cord is perfect , I love it & I would recommend it to anyone looking for a less frustrating solution to a cord that is too short !
5 #### Seem to be good quality and has that great new string sound . Quick shipment , good product , and I have to add more words to this review .
3 #### My fianc and myself use these mophie packs on our iPhone 3GS phones . I understood that these cases were used when I purchased them . But , I assumed they would give our phones at least 1/2 to a 3/4 charge per full charge of the mophie case per phone . Unfortunately , we do n't even get that much out of a full charge . Well , I guess it 's my fault , I should have bought new . But , In my defense , i truly believe products need to be given a more truthful and acurate description by the sellers . Aswell as holding the sellers more liable for selling merchandise that should just be trashed or recycled ! Granted I only paid $ 10 each . but , if I knew the condition of these packs before hand , I never would have purchased them ! ! ! To Amazon : It 's just a thought , maybe there should be a way for describing used products in More detail ? Say a star rating system for physical condition , functionality , etc . etc ... I know it ! I 'm weird ! But , it 's just a thought ! !
4 #### Not as powerful as I wished but then there are more powerful units by this manufacturer ... all in all at the cost and output power , it is an effective and handy fogging machine for small environments . Simple and effective .
4 #### These are my first Noise cencelling headphones . Pros : very comfortable . battery pack /circuit is over the wire So headphone theselves feel light on head . No humming sound like philips / sony . ( on same price range ) Long battery life ( 50hrs ) cheap . ( I got them for 5.99 + SH in a deal ) Cons : As mst people stated , battery / circuit weight on left ear piece can break wire and make them useless . wire is very long So these may not be considered portable . When NC is turned on , high frequency / treble ( music ) gets cut off . Overall decent headphone when cared properly . I am going on 18 Hr nonstop flight next month . Will update this review again with honest opinion .
5 #### I have a Gibson J200 with Grover tuners & this winder will fit . You can see larger slots opposite the regular slots . This will snap over the large Grover tuners and work fine . The regular slots fit a Martin perfectly .
5 #### It 's super cute and it protcts my phone enough . It arrived on time and I did n't have any problems ! .
5 #### It 's Rosin , it works and it 's inexpensive . What 's not to like ?
2 #### It lasted only 11 months of very light usage . It is also easy to depress the button by accident while in the bag , and ended up turning on the laser for a long period of time unintentionally .
5 #### I have been looking at the Otterbox for some time . I have a friend who has one for his Blackberry , and I was concerned about protecting mine from drops and bumps . Also I wanted to keep it from being affected by dust and moisture . The Otterbox Defender Case does all of that . Since I have dropped my Blackberry a few times since I put it in the Otterbox , and have bumped it too . I am doubly glad I purchased it . I would recommend it to any one who owns a Blackberry . Even though I paid extra for the insurance for the phone , this keeps me from having to use it .
5 #### Very nice and heavy duty with a nice long cord . I think it has great sound and the cords are replaceable but for the price get the package .
5 #### This step is great and works as advertised . Looks great also . It comes with a little plastic anti rattle shim . Mine would not stick in place . They sent me a whole new step free of charge and did n't even want me to ship the other one back . Could n't be happier !
5 #### It drys my car very well . I still buffer it with a dry towel , but this takes off 99 % of the water .
1 #### I bought this Haynes book thinking that it would give me the specific information I need to upgrade my cars to R-134a . I picked it because of the 2000 publication date . BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it . The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate . The varous pressure / temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12 . The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers . Charging with R-134a ( which is legal ) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it . There is no info on charging from small cans . There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging . Very disappointing . P.S. I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so do n't let me scare you off Haynes .
5 #### Made out of high quality materials . Fits and snugs right on my computer and on my handycam . Using it to back up my handycam videos and burning them on DVD 's . Great Product !
5 #### I have not yet died working under my 3280 lb car while it was supported with these . They withstand moderate lateral forces on the car in a sturdy manner . They are easy to stack for convenient storage , and they 're a great value .
5 #### Could n't be happier with this product ! Balanced exactly the way I like them ( more towards the hand versus the stick 's shoulder . Plus switching to maple from hickory proved to be a major benefit on the money level . I was shredding hickory sticks ( 85s ) left and right . After using them for a week , they would be more like a rubber pencil . And the worst part : once I started using a new pair , I 'd have to spend a week getting adjusted to the " full " stick again . But not the maple ! They do get beat up ( mainly the bead , not so much the shoulder ) , but only minimally in comparison and thus last much longer than the hickory sticks . And then when I start using a new pair , there 's no adjustment period . Yes , when they fail , it 's usually a complete break , but that has n't happened all that often so far ( maybe 6 times over the span of 2 years ) . Vic Firth is the ONLY product I will ever endorse if given the chance .
5 #### do n't bother buying a dedicated mic splitter device , this does the exact same job !
4 #### Fairly easy to hook up to speaker wires . Allows one amp to drive up to 4 sets of stereo speakers without blowing the amp . Provides very good sound quality to all speakers . However from the " ca n't get something for nothing " department , there is a marked volume drop across all speakers as each pair is brought on - line . Further it would be nice if there were separate volume controls for each pair . My set up includes two sets of outdoor hidden " rock " speakers around our pool , a set of outdoor speakers near our BBQ and a set inside our living room . All are driven adequately with my Yamaha 35watt amp cranked up to max . It would be nice to be able to turn down the living room whilst keeping the BBQ cranked ! Anyway , fine quality product , good price , just may not do everything .
5 #### I 've tried out a handful of great picks , and these are by far the fastest . The point on them is much sharper than the image shows . Some pointed picks are smaller in general size , and I have difficulty getting those to feel right . These feel right , the thickness is comfortable , and the surface makes them easy to grip . My only complaint is that it 's not good for much else besides fast playing -- I would n't recommend this for rhythm , for example . I ca n't imagine it lasting long in that capacity . Also , for slower lead playing it 's certainly bound to be usable , that 's not really taking it to its full potential . So if you want to be able to nail those 32nd notes , this is what you 'd want to use .
5 #### This device at least doubles the iPhone battery life . If you 're traveling , flying or any other situation where recharging is really difficult , bothersome , etc . this is the device for you . It fits the phone very well , and while it does add depth to the phone , it actually makes the phone easier to grip for typing , especially widescreen . The times when I 'm traveling and need the battery to avoid charging or where I ca n't easily find some place to charge happens to be the same times that I use the phone very frequently and drain the battery quickly . This solves the problem of battery life and adds extra grip to the phone . It fits in my front jeans pocket easily .
5 #### Wanted to try Steel strings in a light gauge . Strung up a Rick with these and , though too " zingy " at first , quickly mellowed into a nice lively tone and has lasted . IME , nickel rounds would settle into a half - round - ish tone by now , but these keep their edge . Long term I might regret the fret wear of steel strings , however .
5 #### very good product very good product it is what is . what more can a person want ? So get it and be happy , happy , happy .
5 #### This is the third jawbone , I have owned . The first one I loved it , but my dog chewed it . The second , I gave to my brother , and this is better than those . I recommend jawbone to anyone looking for a bluetooth . I can actually mow my grass and talk on the phone and they do n't even realize I am mowing .
5 #### After waiting close to a year for it to be made available in my area , I just got my cable modem installed today from @home . I had already ordered the LinkSys 4 port router . I was on cloud nine when the ATT folks left after installing the basic cable modem .. replacing my old 28k dial up line , but was a little bit nervous about messing it all up with the changes I 'd need to make to my wiring and settings ... anyway , I finally read the one page " Quick Install " instructions , more or less follwed them , and plugged things together ( 4 workstations , plus an older LinkSys hub driving an HP print server and a LapTop ethernet card ) -- the ENTIRE PROCESS took 25 minutes and it works great ! This is one fine product ( and a great price too . )
5 #### I purchased this item for my Plantronics Voyager Pro+ . I have had a few bluetooth headsets over the years and they were either damaged or lost . I knew after purchasing a headset that I had spent a little bit more money on than the others , I had to invest in some type of protection for it . This case is perfect and the price is just right . I feel safe putting my headset in it and storing it in my pocketbook . I believe the case is sturdy enough that my bluetooth wo n't get crushed . I am very satisfied with my purchase . I like the feel of it , and it 's not too big . My bluetooth fits snug in it . Thank You Very Much :) ETA : I also like the fact that I can fit my extra battery for my Evo 3D along with my Bluetooth . I was going to buy an extra case for my battery , but now I do n't . :)
5 #### Nice and bright , I bought three , one for each of my sons . Sturdy . Batteries life is long ... the first set I put in are still going !
5 #### This charger works great with the phone and looks amazing . When I put my phone on the dock I switch it to the clock mode so the dock makes my phone an alarm clock at nite and keeps my phone in a convenient , safe place . The only bad comment I have to say about it is that it will not fit if you have a case - mate cover over your phone . It is just the right size for just my phone . I 'm not sure if a thinner case will do the trick but it is annoying having to take the case off everyday before bed and putting it back on in the mornings . Other than that I highly recommend it for anyone who does n't like using a case and likes a convenient place to put their phone to charge .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for to start decoden ! Clear , Protective , and easy to remove from Iphone 4 . I only bought one case to try out but , I am totally going to stock up for crafting . Shipping was super fast ; I had zero problem with the company at all . I would totally tell all of my crafting buddies about this phone case !
4 #### Good basic , inexpensive optic for new hunters . My sons used them and liked them . No frills . Will fog on the outside if wet .
5 #### My phones are still all working , the cables look good . I 'd say they do what they 're supposed to do !
5 #### This is the best stuff made for leather seats . Be sure to use this in warmer weather because it does change consistency in colder weather and does n't seem to spread as well .
5 #### Live only 4 miles from an ATT tower and could get only 0 to 1 bar reception in my house . Bought product and now get 5 bars all the time in my house . Simple to install and used only the equipment that came within the package . No extra outdoor antenna nor the more expensive indoor antenna . Great product so far .
5 #### Had mixed feelings about this product and the model below it T2 something . I went with this model for 1 reason and that s the auto turn off that the other seemed not to have . After review the comments was very hesitant , however I am glade I went ahead and ordered it . Works like a charm and have had no issues with it .
4 #### The screen guard is nice it was a little tricky to get it on straight with no bubbles . Now that it is in place I do n't even think about it . Good item .
4 #### The kit was a good one but just did n't fit the radio I purchased .
1 #### Biggest piece of garbage , ever . Bought two of these - one for my phone and one for my sons . Neither one worked . Followed the " simple " instructions - plugged phone into case , then plugged charging cord into case . However , while the case was supposedly charging , the phone was not . In fact , it appeared that the case was draining power from the phone ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT . I will be returning both cases .
5 #### Work'd great on my PC 's around the house . I like it . Thank 's
5 #### It appears to be a high quality product , but I have n't used it to any noticeable mechanical effect . However , I think the legend surrounding it makes it an excellent gift for mechanical inclined / car / motorcycle / boat people . Even the less mechanically interested , seem to respond to it with high praise when it 's given as a gift . I think it speaks to the very human desire to remove gunk and achieve higher efficiency .
4 #### Does not work well in bright sun , but indoors , and when dark , the IR does well . I shoot weddings and local shows , and lighting is always changing , the Ettl is a must , and is also great as a auto - focus assist ( really great in low light ) .
5 #### Such a huge improvement from the stock 55w bulbs . LOVE them , will buy them again and again
5 #### Worked perfectly on my 91 300zx . wiring is well made and fills like an oem piece .
5 #### I have used D'Addario electric and acoustic strings since 1995 . The are my first choice when it comes to guitar strings .
5 #### my Jackson soloist fits very well inside , SKB always have excellent products , is the same that comes with the Fender American Standard series guitar and Basses
5 #### These are solid rubber which makes them very easy to clean . You can put Armor All on them to help keep them clean and shine longer which is what I do weekly . They look great and are heavy enough not to slide around like some of the cheaper ones I have used over the years . I highly recommend these floor mats .
5 #### Ca n't say much other than these are awesome and last for quite some time . I believe my last bulbs lasted over three years with mostly nighttime driving . They are a little pricey but worth it .
5 #### must have for shooting long exposures . Can hold down in " bulb " exposure setting and the device has a lock on it so you can open the shutter , lock it , and walk away . Allows you to take exposures of great lenght withouth manually holding the shutter open .
5 #### This was just what I was looking for . Run 1 coax cable and 2 16GA speaker wires and they fit just right . Attached it to white baseboard and it 's barely noticeable . Attaches firmly , you need to get it right the first time but that is n't all that difficult . Exactly as advertised , very pleased .
1 #### Microphone was so quiet as to be inaudible unless you spoke * really * loudly , which I do n't like to do on a cell phone . The mike also picked up a lot of background noise . Sent it back .
3 #### This will definitely work , but ... With these strap locks , the strap basically goes to the " end of the strap button " , about 3/8 - 1/2 " inch from the guitar body . That extra length puts more torque onto the screw . Make sense ? Unlike the Schaller type locks , where the strap button " sits on " the lock and closer to the body , eliminating that extra torque . On my hollow body Taylor T5 , this may not be a big deal , but on a heavy guitar like a Gibson Les Paul it can be a big deal . Also , my strap ends had double leather so the locks did not fit out - of - the box . I had to cut out some of the leather to make a bigger hole so the locks fit properly .
5 #### Replaced the last cat on my tc with this res . Did nt change sound much but did reduce rasp and give a lil improvement in tone . Did notice a big jump in pull from 50 - 70 mph .
4 #### I have had one for two years and no complaints , needed another for my travel guitar . The lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck , the spring is firm and in 2 years has not given up any tension . Finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple . I take particular caution to make sure that I do n't leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently ...
5 #### This is my third mp3 player . BEST BY FAR . After this , I will never by another diamond product . MP3 's sound fantastic and the volume is great , I love to listen loud . The FM tuner sounds great despite what I 've read from other reviewers . As an owner of a sound studio , my standards are high , and the Nomad sounds excellent . The big test was to see if the management software and data transfer was a breeze or not . Took about 15 secs to load the software plug in the device and start transferring my mp3s . the software is the better than rio port ( diamond 's ) . I have n't owned this product long enough to speak for its durability , but the basic design is tight and puts the new RIO 600 to shame , and is a step above my old RIO 500 . The remote control is a very handy tool to keep the main unit deep in your pocket or backpack . As long as it keeps up what it 's doing , it will be on my recommend list for all . enjoy .
5 #### Tested this out to connect a MK808 Android stick to my Panasonic plasma TV . Works fine , no problems I could tell .
1 #### I had a phone tmobile sim card and I paid for $ 100 in minutes via credit card . kept the phone for emergencies only . tmobile gave my number away to another tmobile customer and penalized me for non use even though I PAID for my minutes . I needed the phone because I got locked into the elevator at Middlesex and my phone did not work . I can still recieve calls from the new user but I can not call out . I get voice messages meant for " Mr L " and Mr L was assigned my phone number . Really horrible customer service from tmobile .
5 #### The key to getting the most out of this armband is putting the thick part of the band with the velcro in the part of the case with the slits . This keeps the band from moving around too much . I 've been running with it for a couple weeks , and no chafing or discomfort . Works perfectly .
5 #### Arrived in timely manner and works as advertised . Has lent real flexibility and security to my network configuration . I 'd recommend again .
5 #### Its nice and easy to use . Secures the strings very good and works for all types of guitars with no issues .
2 #### The product came quickly , but I mislead by the product description and the corresponding questions and answers . It does not work with my MacBook Air , but someone claimed it worked with ANY Mac , so that 's incorrect .
5 #### I was skeptical about getting a multi ball setup , but after reading more about the different brands and styles , I choose convert a ball because it seemed like the safest one out there . I have n't tried towing anything with it yet , but I 'm sure it will do the job just fine , and it 's nice to hace the option of swapping the ball out in seconds vs. finding wrenches and wrestling with trying to get the ball off , or having two different ball mounts . I would recommend this to anyone .
5 #### Good fit . I wear the headset while exercising and do n't have the problem of it moving around or slipping that I had with another brand . Sounds great .
5 #### This cover was purchased to replace the old ADCO 1755 cover that still looked good , fit like a glove and lasted for over five - years . It protected the rear - mounted spare tire on the back of our Roadtrek campervan . It fit perfectly even though it 's .75 inch smaller diameter than what the chart lists for an LT235/75R16 . The old cover was starting to get brittle , so we replaced it . Outstanding value and highly recommended .
5 #### Simple case is all I wanted and that s what I got .
4 #### I needed a simple switch to collect data from three devices and pass across a wireless bridge to my Acccess Point . The location is Out Door in a harsh seaside environment . The switch is mounted inside a waterproof box along with its power supply and another POE power supply for another device . My concern was mostly that the switch might overheat in direct sunlight . After two weeks it is performing very well and has experienced several days in mid-90s . It also works flawlessly over the WiFi Bridge connection . I 'm very happy with this switch . If it does ultimately have issues with heat I would not blame in on this device as I am pushing it hard with this particular application .
4 #### Did n't charge the phone .had to have a new phone sent because the connection was loose.not sure if the phone or cable was to blame so I did n't return it . It fit ok
4 #### It works and everything , but not exactly 6 feet . It does nt really reach me in my bed which is annoying . But I guess that s my fault . It works and yeah lol
5 #### The Dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition , and looking great . It also had two soft cloths that are needed for application , removing excess and polishing . I could n't be happier !
5 #### Great price , excellent product and my electric guitar sounds better than ever , way more " defined and clear " , accurate tuning and soft feel .
1 #### This thing is a piece of junk . Day / Night my butt . If I had n't waited so long to put it on , I 'd return the POS . Save your money and go with a bigger / better one like OEM for your vehicle . Oh yeah , save your money . Can I leave 0 stars ? No ? Darn .
3 #### You get what you pay for . Any guitar worth more than $ 200 and I would buy hard shell .
5 #### I 've played SD , EMG and Dimarzio brand pickups . And after being an EMG fanboy for many years , I made the switch to Seymour Duncan last year . Since then I 've tried about a dozen of their pickup models and this one is my favorite . It has so much volume and sustain . If you want rhythm that cuts through a mix or solo tone that never dies out , this is your pickup
5 #### This card makes carrying data a breeze . I keep movies , games , and music on it , and no matter which ROM I use , it works perfectly . Currently using Cyanogenmod CM10 , but even running the stock OS , it worked fine .
4 #### These have a great feel and sound ! I will be buying these again when another string breaks ( hopefully not too soon ) .
5 #### No complaints here ! Gets the job done and helps organize cables .
5 #### This is the first lens I got for my Canon 20D. It 's a great lens to start out with , as it covers a great range . 28 is pretty useful , but it 's not something you can really use for actual wide - angle . Still useful for relatively close shots . 105 has proven incredibly useful for portraits , nature stuff , pretty much everything I 've tried out so far . The versatility of this lens-- that it can be used close to the subject and far away-- is definitely one of its best features . 3.5/4.5 can be a bit blurry . I generally do pretty well , but I was taking some odd pictures today that did n't come out too well-- different objects at different places , which a higher f - stop would have totally solved . I think someone said in another review to go for around 8 ... USM is absurdly fast . I ca n't get over it . ( Having lived in point - and - shoot / Canon FD land before I got this camera ... ) Definitely do n't settle for the cheaper version of this-- this lens is ergonomically and optically an excellent lens for $ 100 more than the cheap one . USM , great range .
4 #### If I wanted a SILVER colored horn like in the picture I supplied , I would have bought one of those . There are many of them for less than this . Fake ! I am obviously upset . * * UPDATE * * : So , it is Dec 2012 and I am updating this . I found this exact same horn at the local auto parts store . It was black with the red stripe , and I bought it . Got home to swap out the horns and noticed the one I got on here was an FIAMM brand . So , I would guess whoever shipped me my stuff simply sent the wrong item . I never thought to check that it was the right brand , though . I have updated my star rating to 4 . Ca n't find myself able to give it 5 .
1 #### I just received this phone as a replacement ( from insurance ) for my sony s710a and I could not be more disappointed with this phone . The phone would not pair up with my jabra bt250v which I could possibly live without however with the phone being in my pocket I was unable to hear it ringing with the volume on 5 ( the loudest it would go , also there are no " profiles " to possibly make it louder ) The actual sliding portion did feel like it " locked " into place however the top portion of the phone felt very wobbly and cheap . The phone has no flash and you have to adjust the brightness for every photo which makes it useless if your kids are doing something that is a " kodak - moment " . I did n't find the phone to be user - friendly out of the box , for instance factory default is when you dial a number and close the slide it hangs up the call . this can be disabled but it was a shocker the first time . All in all , go with the w600i sony phone ( that 's what the insurance company is going to be sending me as yet another replacement )
4 #### It was nice & It was a great gift but still not as the picture looked .
5 #### Just received this cord and it seems to work as expected . What can you say about an adapter cord ? It is well made , good construction and sound from my DSLR with my mic is superb .
5 #### Good or better than expected . Have 4 electric guitars can now take this one with me in confidence that it 's protected .
3 #### The service kit works great the problem is squeezing the bottle every time to apply the oil to the entire filter , next time I will buy the spray can service kit .
3 #### Bought as a back up phone for my husband because he is a phone killer . Great buy , excellent price . Phone does n't do much but makes calls and texts just fine !
3 #### I have a 32 GB Samsung Galaxy Note 3 . I added this memory for extra storage for pictures and such . It was easy to install and it works fine . I did n't test the speed or anything but it 's really not that critical . I knocked off 1 star because brand new memory should n't have more than 3 GB missing like that . I mean , it 's an add on memory , there is no OS on it , so where is there only 28.78 GB available ? I formatted the memory once installed and still the same thing without anything put on the memory yet . Unless the Samsung / Android OS puts something on the add on memory in order to manage it 's contents , but I highly doubt it . When I get a 32 GB flash memory , I have 32 GB of space available on it . So , why is this one only 28.78 GB ?
5 #### Just wanted to chime in . I have one of these . I replaced the pickups with tone rider PU I bought out here on amazon . Changed the attitude completely . I use this guitar as my player . I play praise and worship using a line6 live XT direct to PA and have the versatility to play most songs with no issues . We play 2 times per month and this guitar has held up for over a year now . Use this guitar for rock blues and country and it does just fine . I actually chose this over my PRS these days as it fits me better . I am going to upgrade soon to the Modern tele plus . That guitar also looks like a great deal for the price ! Have fun and rock on ! ! !
5 #### These have been my go - to strings for over twenty years . You ca n't beat 'em . They 're smack - dab in the middle of all the other strings in terms of quality , sound , and cost - effectivity . For what I do they work well and always have .
5 #### Is as described , crosses over where it needs to crossover :)
5 #### Has enough space to carry ally my gear in one place .
5 #### I just wrote a review on 160 Maxell tapes ( 3 pack ) . This 4 pack of 120 minute is a good buy of fine quality reliable blank tapes .
5 #### Just got this stick holder , it looks to be a good choice . Holds the sticks , mallets and brushes firmly and makes them easily accessible . Nice addition to my drum kit .
5 #### These are the only strings I use for my G&L Tribute guitars and my Les Paul . I 've always liked them .
1 #### KB Gear has gone out of business ! ! Does not work with XP and never will .
5 #### The best thing you can do for your ragtop ! Make sure to clean the top first , let dry completely ( day or more ) , then apply this stuff . Do ot every year !
5 #### It has what you want in a cable , and not what you do n't . Not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it , but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends . So there it is ; nothing magical , just a guitar cable .
5 #### I 'm an amateur sound tech . We 've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers / song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we 've had before . Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews . When I received it I can not wait to test it myself and whoaaah .. For me , it sounded better than SM58 . My songleaders have tested it and guess what ... they do n't want to use the SM58 anymore :)
5 #### I have tried cases from almost every major case manufacturer , and the otterbox commuter is overall the best case I have ever used . It 's water resistant , not huge , and not ugly . It protects very well . I have dropped my phones many times , and the otterbox always protected it perfectly . I will continue to use these cases until something better comes out , which is probably never . Speck , Griffin , etc cases are junk .
5 #### Used this quite a bit last year for a bike rack , and a generator rack , that go on the front hitch of our truck . It worked very well for both uses and kept the items from rattling around on rough roads .
4 #### Works Well . Does The Job . Same Manufacturer As Big Box Store For Well Under 1/2 Price
5 #### It was very good and on time ! ! Highly recommended I really like this product . very good , I like it . great ! !
5 #### Increased my internet speed by 2 mb a second over the regular cable . I wish I had done it a long time ago !
2 #### This is not a 2000maH charger . When plugged in to the LG G2 , the G2 has a popup saying to plug into the manufacturers to get full charge rate . This does not put out enough current to keep the battery charged when using the phone as a GPS in the car . For the G2 you can use the " Current Widget " to see the battery charge rate . And this charger just charges at the same rate as a standard charger This charger has no label on it stating the output current ( unusual , does n't even claim to be 2A ) only has made in China . The charge cable is very thin , not heavy like the cable that comes with the phone . There is no way this can provide high current without too much voltage drop . I did succeed in finding a car charger that will fast charge . Picked up a GT Max USB car charger that has both a 2A and 1A USB ports . But it will only work as a fast charger when used with heavy USB cables such as came with the phone .
5 #### There is NOTHING wrong with this very affordable and effective case at all .
4 #### Cleaner seems to work well . I soak the filter and let it sit for a half hour or so , then wash off with a hose in the driveway . Seems to get the filter clean . Then I blow the loose water off the filer ( with a blower , not an air compressor ) and let it dry thoroughly in the sun before reoiling .
5 #### I 've always liked larger triangle picks and first tried the Clayton 1 mm black picks but they are a little too stiff for me , so I dropped down to the .8s and I love them . The size is great , the feel is perfect , not too stiff to play chords but stiff enough for fast picked arpeggios and soloing , and the tone is awesome ... they are white too so they are easy to spot on top of my amp :) If you are looking for a bigger pick , try these out . I think you 'll like them .
5 #### I used this kit to clean and protect the soft top , fender flares and a couple of other plastic parts on my Jeep . I was lazy this winter and neglected to clean my Jeep which stained the top and fender flares . My jeep is lifted with large tires that sling road debris all over the vehicle including the roof . I had to scrub pretty hard with the cleaner but it removed all of the stains from my top . I did n't spend as much time on the roof so there were still some stains on it but they were almost completely hidden when I applied the UV protectant . The final result was very good . My top looks great now . I also used the UV protectant on all of the plastic pieces on the jeep and and aside from the scratches left from trail rides they look brand new . This is the first product I have used like this so I ca n't say it 's the best product out there and I just used it today so I ca n't speak to the durability but so far I am 100 % satisfied . I will update this review after I put some miles on the vehicle . I 'm sure I will sling some mud all over it soon so we will see how it holds up to some abuse . If it holds up I see no reason to even try anything else .
4 #### It does n't fit my Les Paul SG . I really do n't see why a simple part such as this must come in different screw sizes . Stupid on both parts . Stupid Gibson for not standarizing the toggle switch screw size for the knob and stupid me for not seeing that coming .
5 #### I have had these headphones since about 1987 . I ca n't think of one other piece of electronics that I still own and use . The bass on these are so phenomenal , but it 's not overpowering . You hear every piece of every piece of music . Highs are also excellent . These are the one thing that sounded better than my ex - speakers ( Klipsch KG-4 's ) . The only thing I have replaced is the ear coverings , themselves . Otherwise , just as perfect as ever and very comfortable , to boot . You 'll love them if you buy them .
5 #### A great classic . Love it 's low end . These , to me , sound way better undertuned than a a clear emperor would .
1 #### Not happy with my Nook . Be forewarned ... you can pay for some books and they will download but you ca n't open them . How to avoid this ? Open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for Nook .. and not nook color or nook etc ... just Nook . I 've had to ask for credits several times already . There are n't enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing . Maybe the Nook Color is a better bet ?
5 #### Excellent ! I 'm no longer worry about wires lingering around my kids bedroom !
3 #### Seems like a good product but it stopped working after a few months . Plugged up my old stock horn and I 'm back in business .
5 #### Purchased as a refill for my label maker . Item came quickly and works perfect !
5 #### I busted the screen on one of my PSP 3001 's when modding the shell . I went looking everywhere for a cheap one , but the cheapest was 45 bucks . Then I found this one for 15 bucks ( 21 or so after shipping charges ) . I bought it and received it a lot earlier than expected . I thought it had a nasty scratch on it at first , but I realized that it was just a screen protector . I peeled that off and it was in prestine condition . I put it in the PSP and it worked right away . I also appreciate the tiny screwdriver that is supplied with it as it is the perfect size , and slightly magnetized . Booted a few games with it and there were no graphical problems . Very pleased with this purchase and would get this again if I ever needed one .
1 #### These cables are a crap shoot . I ordered one about 3 months , and was extremely pleased . It charged my phone as well as transferred data . I just ordered four more to leave in various locations . The cable that I got looked completely different than the first cable that I received . The only reason that this concerned me was it shows that the seller either switched suppliers or multi - sources under the same part number . I plugged the cable into my phone . The charging light illuminates , but does not charge . I left my phone overnight and it died on the cable plugged into a laptop . I have since tried several other USB ports . None have changed the issue . Data is transferred to and from the phone . I wound up cutting apart one of the cables . It looks like pin 4 , the ID pin , is not tied to ground via a resistor or directly . I can not find much on the subject , but my guess is that the EVO requires this pin tied to something to allow charging . 7/12/11 I was contacted by the seller , refunded , and told that the issue was resolved .
5 #### Works well . I used this as part of a wok - fi ( wifi - antenna ) . A strainer served as a receiver dish , and boosted my signal , since my home 's wifi - doesn't completely reach my shop , unassisted .
5 #### Elixer strings are the best strings . They feel great sound great and last forever . I would highly recommend them ! 5 stars !
4 #### Thick heavy ( no flex ) picks might not be for everyone but those who have a light touch will like these .. nice to strum with , easy to pick with if you do n't pick to hard . Indentations help keep the pick in place between your fingers , once you get used to the thickness and lack of flex you might like them .
5 #### These binoculars are fantastic . Whether you are an avid birdwatcher , private investigator , or would like to spy on your hot neighbor while she is getting out of the shower or undressing without getting caught , you will be capable of doing that from very far away .
5 #### I own on of these and love it so much I got my brother one for Christmas . Though small , this radio has great reception of regular and shortwave channels , without any sort of cumbersome antenna wire to deal with . The batteries last a long , long time , even when I fell asleep and left it on all night a couple times . Just do n't break the antenna off right away , which I always seem to do ! Anyone would have fun with this . ( Oh , and it 's VERY sturdy . I actually did a human cannonball thing , diving face first onto mine , when holding onto the dog 's leash as it saw a cat , and though I got a black eye , the radio was unscathed and still working great . )
1 #### I 'm uploading pictures because this piece of junk does not even come close to other Internet modem cables I 've bought in the past . No more Belkin . Note that one clasp , on the left I believe , is shorter than the plastic clasp that did not break . This short length made all the difference in the world between a quick removal and losing an hour with the help of a screw driver to finally depress it . Amazon needs to get hep to products like this and remove them from its wares . This is not a marketable product . This Belkin High - Speed Internet Modem Cable is made of cheap plastic with a thin plastic clasp to fit it to a computer plug for dsl , Mine did not work because of a poor connection . It took hours to figure out that ATT was n't my problem . Item failed to remove easily because the thin , plastic clasp broke inside my computer 's plug - in - - another lost hour . It took a lot of time getting it out without damaging my computer . Adding injury to insult , I relied on previous reviews and made a same day order for about $ 6 , non - refundable I gather . Worse , it did n't arrive on the same day .
5 #### This is quickly becoming a very hard to get item since vcr 's are now few and far between . This item is almost non - existent in stores . It does the job it was made for . You ca n't ask for anything more .
5 #### The P - Touch labeler makes it 's easy to label anything . The quality of the labels are good and work in most situations .
5 #### I was also having installation problems with this device at first , but I discovered that , under WinXP , if you plug the adapter into the USB port first , then plug in the joystick , it will report ' USB device not recognized ' , etc . and appear as ' Unknown ' under USB controllers in Device Manager . Attempting to add the sidewinder through the gameport control panel also fails in that state ; however , if you first mate the adapter to the joystick DB-15 , then plug it into the USB port , it will recognize it properly and , under Device Manager , it will be listed as a Human Interface Device . In my case , I have a Sidewinder Precision Pro and it identified it immediately .
5 #### Good quality picks , I got all 12 of them in a nice little plastic pouch . Looks great too . Buy them .
5 #### I install them in watches and the watches start working again which tells me these batteries work . when used in my personal watches I know I will get a good 2 - 3 years life from them .
5 #### Real easy to install . 4 screws and clips , provided , I would recommend this item to anyone ...
5 #### Like a guy , I did not read the instructions until it was installed . Glad I am a mechanical engineer as it worked great with my new tank as purchased for my M38 - A1 Jeep
5 #### Seems to be made well . Have n't taken it off road yet . Installed on Polaris Ranger Crew
5 #### As a drummer , you need these for a unique rhythm sound . Also great for the lead singer to play .
5 #### This is the best , just get it and see for yourself .
5 #### These are fantasic ! I cut them into strips to hold my laptops in place on an angled table top . They do get dirty and need to be cleaned , but they hold the laptops and phones that I put on them .
4 #### These cables work very well . They are very soft to the feel , so I 'm hoping that wo n't shorten their life .
5 #### Works really well so far . I do not see any loss in picture quality through this long cable .
1 #### I was using this to control the volume of a pillow speaker . After 3 weeks use the headphone jack socket became loose , and it stopped working . I 've used Koss products for decades , and this is the first time I 've had trouble . As other reviewers have said , I also found that the printing on the unit does n't match the photo ; it just has the word " KOSS . "
5 #### It 's cheap , simple , and it works ! ! Now I can easily take out my SIM card from my iPhone and change it to another one . ( I sometimes travel between countries and I 'm using an unlocked iPhone 4 ) Easy to carry , easy to use . It 's just simple as that .
4 #### The tape video head cleaner works as expected . Very good product . I recommend it for those who want to keep their old VHS equipment .
1 #### I received the 256 MB version , not the advertised 512 MB version . Take care who you order from . Mine also locks up within a day of booting up and requires a hard restart . When I pull the SD card and put it into another Pi I have , it runs fine . Perhaps this is a knockoff or something ? The box looks different from the ones I received when ordering from sites other than Amazon . Buyer beware .
5 #### Strong velcro grip , long enough to wrap a bunch of cables together , short enough to still be convenient when just wrapping one . Good product .
4 #### For $ 10 more , upgrade to an N80 w/ uPNP , video calling , WiFi , bar code reader , MS Word , Excel , PowerPoint , PDF , Safari browser , higher resolution screen
5 #### I put these on a cheap bass and they perform well ..
5 #### Good product but over priced . But , part of that is the Canon name . There are products like this that are equally as good , however .
5 #### These drum heads are ridiculously durable . They can take a good beating daily and still retain their amazing sound . Took a little while to break in , but that 's the case with all drum heads . I recommend them .
5 #### I wanted a simple strap for my bass and this one is great .
5 #### such an amazing tom batter head . I have used these drumheads for over 14 years . There is nothing negative about them , if someone does this they are n't the greatest , odds are you do not know how to tune a drum head , in that case , get a drumdial and these will sound amazing !
5 #### Perfect covering for my binding projects , very clear and easy to see what has been bound
5 #### Love it . Very sturdy . This is my third adapter and by far the best . I chose this one because the last brand I ordered broke due to the entire housing being one piece . I move from car to car and pulling it out each time caused it to break . This Bestek allows just the plug to pull out and I could move it easily . It also allowed me to move the charger part anywhere I need .
5 #### Easier on the fingers for a beginner than the steel strings . These strings also made the guitar have a more mellow sound and not as much " twang " . Maybe its just me .
5 #### This is the best bluetooth headset designed as of yet ever made . It 's very comfortable , the quality of the sound on both ends is great , easy to charge unlike other bluetooth headsets that I 've owned where you have to diconnect the ear hook and place the bluetooth in a small charging case which was a lot of hassle . I have purchased four of these H710 sets recently for myself , friends and family ! Fast reliable free shipping .
5 #### After my original rear blade was replaced , I had a hard time finding one that would wipe a full clean swipe , finally after trying several inferior blades this one is perfect ! I have a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee , and this 13 " blade fits perfect and stays in complete contact with the rear window .
4 #### Not the greatest , but after a month it is still working great . I wish it had more than 1,5 and 10 minutes light time though , but for $ 12 you ca n't really go wrong ! I 'm running the 23watt GE CFLs and it all works flawlessly .
5 #### Works great . Reliable . Using to power my cameras . It just works .
5 #### Had one of these when I was a kid , since then some things have changed inside the circuit boards ... But they still sound loud and clear ... Very compact
3 #### UPDATE - I 've stopped using this product and switched to a similar Skull Candy product . I used Koss for years and was a loyal customer . I kept having these break , at a rate of about one a month , and I was gentle with them ! I think the company has seriously cut back on quality . I liked the sound and foam sound blocking , but reliability became a problem . ORIGINAL REVIEW I 've owned several sets of earbuds and these are just great especially and truly when you consider you can get these for well under $ 20 . For me the biggest issue with any ear bud or portable headphone is they let in far too much noise . You can spend a bazillion dollars on a set of snazzy phones , but if there 's a baby crying next to you , well you 're sound experience is going to be less than ideal . For a city denizen like me , common noise pollution is subway trains , sirens , chatty cell phone blatherers etc . Airplanes are another problem for portables because of noise . The plug , by blocking outside noise so effectively , solves this problem . Another bonus you do n't see often is that Koss backs all their products with a lifetime warranty . Send them a check for $ 6 to cover shipping and they will fix or replace your plugs , even if you do n't have a receipt ! ! The plug is big sound in a very portable package . I 'm hooked .
3 #### This is a really nice item and I got two of them . Unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and I had to force it which has created a little wobble . That 's the problem with mail order . Sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it . Oh well so far its working OK with the my old classical ( beater ) guitar I have hanging on the faulty one . The other unit seems to be rock solid . Oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar .
5 #### I had the scala 500 and lost it . I bought this one to replace it . Always good sound and easy to operate . I love the over - the - ear piece that comes with it , they do n't stay in my ear without it . I think it is the best thing out there for the price .
5 #### Bought this when it was in the goldbox for a friend . He has 4 setup in a raid and it seems to be working great . They just work . Seagate has never steered me wrong .
2 #### I originally gave this product a 4 out of 5 star review ( 4 because I did n't like how the very tight clip putting indentations in my visor ) . However after only about a month of use , the spring mechanism for the retractable mic got stuck in the deployed ' on ' position and did not allow me to push the mic back into the unit to turn it off . Very disappointed as I liked the design and sound quality of this product . Fortunately as always , Amazon was very good in accepting my return for this defect . I have since replaced it with the sleek new Jabra SP5050 speakerphone which in my opinion is a much better product than the BlueAnt from a design standpoint . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Jabra - SP5050 - Bt - Speakerphone / dp / B000XQGJUG / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Jabra SP5050 Bt Speakerphone</a >
3 #### This is not a good book in fact it is not a book in the classical sense instead it reads like a stream of consciousness flowing with connected and disconnected free associations from the mind of a hallucinating post - surgical patient battling a morphine high . In this story the patient never wakes up . I ca n't recommend this for casual readers or for anyone younger than twenty - one . Pretty rough stuff . I will not read it again .
4 #### The cost for these units is fabulous , and if you seldom have to replace a fuse , they 're great . I put one of these on an experimental rig in my Suburban that I end up replacing the fuse on about once a week . This fuse holder is finicky . For some reason , getting the fuse into it is often a pain . I can spend as much as 30 seconds fiddling with it before getting the fuse to go in . That 's not a lot of time big picture wise , but it gets annoying after a while . Durability wise , it seems excellent . Mine has endured regular abuse for several months now , and shows no signs of serious wear .
2 #### Even after tuning this thing , I have a hard time hearing anyone in a busy city , and have never gotten anyone to reply to a radio check .
5 #### great item helps keep the screen from damage from dust and durt
4 #### This covers the " more than the basics " of the camera and keeps the information at your fingertips . Best of all , I highly recommend this tool to anybody who does n't use the camera on a regular basis . If you are like most who pick up the camera every now and again for those family gathers or the occasional trip this helps put you back on track . If you use the camera frequently enough to know the ins and outs then perhaps you will know most of what is covered . I find it useful and much easier than the manual . It is also easier to replace eventually instead of wearing thin the manual from flipping through it .
5 #### If you want a little extra bright sound with still an xtra light string on the lower register these give a little extra plucking pop on the E string . I 've used daddario 's for years and it 's nice to have this option .
4 #### Compr estos binoculares como regalo para mi esposa , que gusta de observar aves . No los he usado personalmente , pero ella est muy satisfecha , as que los puedo recomendar .
5 #### Perfect for hiding cords , especially if you 're baseboards are white . It 's a tiny bit tricky to get the cords inside the slot but if that were n't the case they would n't be hidden as they are . Resting on top of the baseboard , the channel blends in so well that most people would need to look twice and three times to realize that they are n't part of the baseboard themselves . You can cut them to any length you need , join them , angle them , etc .
5 #### These are such comfortable picks ... I love the texture on them , which makes them easy to hold without being distractingly aggressive like some of the other picks ' textures . This is subtle yet effective . My favorite pick now .
5 #### I 've used these cheap - o headphones for 4 1/2 years , and the foam around the earpieces finally disintegrated . I used them so much I wore them out . These are amazing little phones for the price . They are not studio grade $ 200 closed ear quality , but rather a great quality for listening to the iPad or iPhone while you are puttering around the office and want to hear decent quality music without bothering the family . I 've just ordered another pair .
5 #### I just bought a new Taylor K66CE 12 string guitar and tried several other capos before I bought this one . None of others worked very well . This one works perfectly all the way up the neck with no buzz or distortion . I 'm very please with the performance of this capo and would highly recommend it .
1 #### who buys this junk your better off using silver Duct tape or one of the fashionable colors they offer in Duct tape then this rubber junk
5 #### Works really good , if you have a steady hand as you are laying it out . Does not reposition well , so make sure it goes where you want it to go .
5 #### This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box . I had not problem with it at all , it is well worth the purchase . I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV . I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor , I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV . For me it was just right not too long or too short , I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand , it did not fall or anything else , it is fine . Use your own judgement , I 'm too busy watching my movies :)
5 #### I have had an aging 10mbps linksys hub as the core of my small home network for several years . Even though I was happy with it , I bought one of these , primarily because it was cheap and thought having a ' spare ' could n't hurt . I had no idea how much that aging piece of equipment was slowing down my network ! Almost everything I have now is 10/100 , so dropping in this switch made my whole network a heck of a lot faster . Furthermore , as a switch ( as opposed to a hub ) , it is much more efficient with the use of the network - traffic is n't broadcast everywhere , only to the nodes that need it . I am VERY happy with this purchase . Cheap , fast , and drop - in simple installation to my existing network . I decided to purchase another as a ' spare ' and donate my older hub to history .
4 #### Great , reliable strings . Nothing special . But they do what 's needed and sound great .
3 #### The Crash Pad drum rug seems to be fairly well thought out , and constructed . While it does have a kick ram block on the audience end of the rug to stop the bass drum creeping forward , and non - slip material sewn into the bottom along the edges , and weighted corners , the manufacturer left out one critical are of safety , and that 's the rest of the underside of the rug . Once rolled out , with gear on it , you can still slip , and fall if you 're not bloody careful when going to your drum kit . The rug seems to be strong enough to hold up to the riggers of frequent gigging , or studio work . However , it can slide around on a hardwood , or concrete surface . It is a bit thin , though , and the factory creases do n't quite lay down easily . Maybe if it were heavier , it would lay flatter on the floor . I would highly , and strongly recommend , and urge you to get a non - slip mat for under rugs , and use it under this product at all times . Maybe even permanently sew , and or glue the non - slip mat onto the bottom of the Crash Pad . I am a bit miffed at the price for this product , though . I think it should sell for about twenty , or thirty percent less for this level of quality .
5 #### This has worked flawlessly for several years . It is nice to have one wire plugged in that I only have to switch the end for .
1 #### Having been a professional photographer for over 25 years I expected Nikon to produce superior results . Forget that the camera is difficult to use , the final quality of the pictures is poor . If you shoot only in sunlight or shadow it 's OK , but mix them and the result is unacceptable . No latitude , or gamma , and even Photoshop fails to correct the problems . Maybe in the future , but until then , buy something to play with but use real film . I returned mine ...
4 #### Just like I said in the title , this is great for an initial , equal , torque before tuning , but nothing more really .
5 #### I never use any other kind of guitar strings on my acoustic guitars . I 've played guitar now for about 8 years , I have a Taylor 214 CE , Washburn D10S and a WG25SCE , and a Jasmine by Takamine S34CFM . I use these strings on all four guitars , they all sound great . Very bright and full sound .
1 #### I 've bought 3 of these by now , and with this third one I learned that I should have gotten the original pocket from the start . These do n't fit in and look as nice as the original pocket does , it kind of stands out , and after pushing it in the first time , forget about taking it out in one piece . No matter how carefully you are with it , the tabs or the trim piece that covers the face will snap off , and a few teeth will break off , making it impossible to put together in one piece again , so you either super glue it , tape it or come up with something special to put it in . I just got an OEM pocket from a fellow Passat owner over the internet . It fits in MUCH MUCH better , it snaps into place perfectly , and does n't rattle or break away . In my opinion , spend the extra bucks getting the original pocket , you will not regret it . Metra makes some good items , I got their harness and antenna , but this is not one of them .
5 #### The Panasonic headphones for $ 4.47 are a true bargain . They work fine and are inexpensive to replace . I have used $ 100.+ headphones , only to have them stop working . First the volume control then the drivers . I replaced three cords , each costing more than one of the Panasonic RP - HT21 's .
5 #### Great radio made very well . Good to have during emergencies and camping trips . Can be mibile
4 #### One plastic part away from a 5 star review . ( The hinge which connects the tripod to the music holder . ) Other than that , pretty indistinguishable from the original .
4 #### This is fine as a general stick - on inexpensive pick holder . It does n't hold very many picks , but it really does n't have to . I would give this five stars except that I really prefer the Planet Waves LED key chain / pick holder over this . It costs more but has more functional value to me . If all you need is something very simple , and you have a surface you can stick it on , then this is fine .
5 #### Good quality for your money . You do n't have to spend more for a similar prodduct as this one . 5 stars .
5 #### Needed a good case for my E - Trex and could n't beat this OEM from Garmin . Great case , and fits the need when out hiking to protect the unit .
5 #### This multi - charger eliminates all the myriad transformers that I used to have to take when traveling , and cleaned up my nightstand . It charges five devices simultaneously including my power hungry iPad . Two thumbs up !
5 #### Best tapes on the market . plus this seller is great ! !
5 #### These jack stands are very light weight and made me a little nervous when I first got them , but it turns out they 're pretty durable . Granted , I use it to hold up a Ford Ranger , not an 18 wheeler , but I 've been pleased with how sturdy and stable they are . Bottom line , my truck has n't fallen on me and crushed me yet - so they 're alright by me .
4 #### I bought 3 of these this year , I guess out of habit . They seem a bit loose where they plug to the slot , but maybe that 's normal . It did n't keep me from buying 2 more of them .
5 #### Made in the U.S.A. ( at least what I got was ) , unlike the rest of their products which are made by slaves in china . These are decent covers to keep both the male and female connections clean . But you either need to remove them completely and put them in a clean place when connecting the trailer or you 'll have to clean them out before recapping the connectors or they 'll be rather useless . Thankfully the retention strap comes off and goes back on fairly easily so it 's not difficult to completely remove them and put them in the glove box or some other clean place . I also recommend using an antioxidant joint compound on the connections to keep them from corroding . Electrical connections which are kept clean and free of corrosion are so much more reliable .
5 #### put all those stupid , fluffy descriptions aside because only 2 words are needed to describe these speakers - THEY ROCK ! Never thought I would pay so little for so much !
3 #### This is probably the best sliver key polisher you 'll find .... HOWEVER , although it gets the job done , the cloth sheds a lot . After I finished polishing my instrument , I had little white particles all over the floor .
1 #### Love the idea . But the metal connection to the amplifier from the antenna is RED HOT . I 'm not saying it 's warm , it 's hot enough to burn me by barely touching me . I want to give 5 stars . I just want to do it painlessly . Please contact me ASAP JIM
4 #### 1997 jeeP wrangler TJ - difference not as ls improved as expected , but still an improvement over OEM by 150 % - ( visual MOS test )
5 #### So far I 'm happy with them . Just put them on and over tuned the high E and plain G and they did n't break , so that was nice ! Have a nice feel to them . I want to see how long the .09 E lasts which is why I bought two sets . They has a fast action . They are also gentle on your hand with bar cords . I 'm very much out of practice so I have to get my strength and callouses back , especially since I broke a wrist bone several years back . If the E goes on this I may go with regular slinkys ( .10 E ) . That 's a wait and see issue . I previously used Fender strings and all my friends used these so I tried them and my initial reaction is VERY NICE . So far . Let 's wait and see .
5 #### It eliminates the hassle of changing batteries during a gig and it saves wearing out expensive batteries during long practice sessions .
5 #### I 've been using a Verizon pouch with my Droid X , but I 've been a bit concerned that the clip would break off . So I bought one of these cases given the reviews were generally positive and it looked like a good design . I 'm impressed , the quality is very good , my Droid X fits perfectly , and it attaches to my belt securely even without using the loops .
5 #### These are very nice high quality jack stands . When these are under my car , I do not worry about them failing . The safety pin is also a nice feature for double assurance . I am very impressed with the jack stands and recommend them to anyone .
4 #### I met Sterling at NAMM a few times and each time he gets a little more looney . Personally I do n't care for men who dress up in costume for social events but if you like that sort of theatrical foolery , then these strings are your bag . The strings are bass strings so if you 're a bassist like me , you either like what you like or you like what someone else told you to like . The packaging is purple with black lettering . The end .
3 #### I do n't like that the power and ground are hardwired into the box . I would have preferred a connector so that I could easily disconnect it . The speaker on mine does n't seem to be working either . I purchased a used one , and it may or may not have been refurbished . If it functions well beyond the speaker it will be worth the purchase .
1 #### very bad . The phone arrived with the dead screen . it does not work . I do not recommend this seller
5 #### I normally use nylon picks but do some songs with flatpicking intros and the nylons were to flappy . These picks keep a nice bright tone , very little friction on the strings - so low string noise . Enough grip to stay put in hands well too .
4 #### Works great in my home network . Purchasing another one as my son is in need of expansion and has asked me to get him a switch .
3 #### this is a great case i just do n't use it that much because it does nt really protect my phone from being damage
5 #### Everything you would expect in a guitar strap -- workmanship , color . Slides easy on your shoulder . Side piping adds a very nice color accent .
3 #### Not sure if it is my camera or the lens but it will not AF . Other then that a great deal !
4 #### Did what I needed it too and costed less than anywhere else . Very pleased .
5 #### read a few of the below reviews and you will get the picture : these are the best portable headphones for iPod use , hands down . They sound incredible , and are best for working out / walking with an iPod . NOTHING compares . Not the ipod ear buds , not $ 300 isolation headphones that go in your ear ( i wasted big time and money on them) ... nothing . If you only buy two headphones in your lifetime , but these for your ipod and a pair of Grado SR60's/80 's for home ipod / stereo use . YOu will be happy you did .
5 #### i got this to install in my ' 62 truck and figured I might as put a dedicated port and use the cable i already own as opposed to buying another car charger . i 'm so glad i did because this usb charger seriously charges my iphone fast . faster then my rocketfish car charger to be honest . I 've not tried charging two things at once to see how it works but so far very good ! I 'm very glad I bought this to update my old truck . it was very easy to install and the green led lets it know that it 's working . the face plate is removeable so no need to drill more holes which was one of the main reasons I bought this port .
5 #### This makes string changes a breeze . The handy wire cutter is an added bonus because you do n't have to carry around another tool for that job . The pin puller is not so great . Never worked for me . Everything else is great
5 #### Given that the " Semi - Open " headphones sounded like a weird sales pitch , i think its pretty accurate . I m using this for my home studio , tracking and mixing . since they are n't made for tracking and do not prevent leakage at a 100 % rate I 'd recommend to use a lower volume when tracking . still if you have budget , get headphones that are dedicated for tracking so you would n't have to even be concerned for sound leakage . the sound quality is amazing , its the first time i listened to music at such amazing quality , I heard things I have n't heard before , even on my stereo system which is pretty amazing as well . it sits really nice on your head and the volume is n't blowing away , i mean you can get to a very high volume and not feel like it 's busting your brains , It sounds really balanced and smooth . they do not look so fragile but they are extremely light so I would watch my way with them . I 'd also recommend getting an extra cable just in case , since its not a regular cable you could find everywhere , i suppose .
5 #### I had purchased this same headset many months ago and misplaced it . I loved the first one so I knew going with the same model was the only way to go .
3 #### Feels pretty darn cheap and the cable is frighteningly thin but I have had this thing for years and have not been particularly nice to it and it still works .
5 #### I bought this primarily for vacationing and only put it in for " a day or two " to try it out . Now I ca n't bring myself to put in the original battery-- it 's very freeing to not have to give a second thought to enabling GPS , autosync , wi - fi , 3G. Took 3 days to drop to 50 % .
5 #### or any 2.5 mm jack ....... no complaints these are filler words to complete the review only six more to go before I finish
1 #### The barrel of the gun is to small to accept the cartridge . I spilled and ruined one grease cartridge . you have to be King Kong to push the cartridge in . The handle and hose are okay , I bought a lubrimatic grease gun and have no problem . The cartridge , the same one that wo n't go in the Legacy gun , slid right in . Do n't buy this product !
4 #### I know this is a great product . I 've had a set before . I have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless . The product comes in a clam shell package . For me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some . There are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box was n't fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere . I found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless . The product is too inexpensive to bother with a return . If I find a retaining clip that will work ( I do have one to compare with ) then I can use it . That said , I 'll say again , the Straplok System is a great product . I know , I 've owned another set for more than twenty years !
5 #### This set is a nice color variety to be suitable for both genders , but they were shipped direct from China which took a long time . The pastel tone ones ( Bluecell 4 Pack of Purple Pink Stylus Universal Touch Screen Pen ) are 4 - 3/8th long , also shipped from China ) . This three though are only 4 inches long so be sure that length is comfortable for your fingers . If comfortable the smaller size is easier to conceal in shirt pockets . As a practical matter the stylus are not returnable because postage back to China starts at $ 1.10 and increases from there .
5 #### I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes . I used d'addarios for many years . I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable . they sound great too . The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating .
4 #### not as cold as I would like but works good
5 #### Installed this lift today . I must admit , at first I thought it would n't ad a significant amount of lift , but to my surprise , I looks awesome ! Rides nice . I would highly recommend this item , and the price was great ! Less expensive than most auto part stores ! Shipping was great ( a little late due to holidays ) . NOTE * This item was installed on a 1995 GMC Suburban 4X4 .
5 #### Perfect for waking the neighbors ! These strings are LOUD on my Gretsch , and sound deep and coppery . They held up to daily use for about 5 months before I could no longer keep them in tune ... very good life in my experience .
5 #### Grabbed this for a business trip as my new Note 3 had a case that covered the back but not the whole phone . This fit the bill ! Pull the back cover off Note 3 , snap it in to this cover and you are good to go . Still fits in my pocket and I do n't need to worry about keys or anything else banging against the glass on the phone . So far it seems to be holding up great with the limited abuse its been subjected to . Yes , I would recommend this product !
4 #### these are super bright but I believe due to the heat they produce , they tend to burn out quickly
5 #### Ran two cans through on the last fill up , will run a can every oil change .
4 #### This product seems like a gimmick , but I was willing to try anything to get better service in some spots in the town where I attend school . This antenna really does help . I ca n't vouch for improvements in walkie - talkie service with Nextel , as I was still unable to get service in the same areas , but it made vast improvements with my Sprint voice service . I found up to 1 bar service increases , plus enhanced voice quality and less static . If you 're looking for a cheap passive repeater , this is it . Unless you live in an area where service is barely existing and a dynamic repeater is required , this antenna will do the job .
4 #### love the sound quality of music . sometimes people have a hard time hearing me - maybe the microphone could be improved ?
5 #### what is there not to like . 5 stars for seller and product
3 #### When I first ordered my phone through Verizon . I went ahead and ordered the car kit with window mount at the same time . I found it very useful and ordered a second for another vehicle of mine , it just too much of a hassle removing the mount from car to car . The only thing I wish this car mount would be better is if it would accomodate the phone while it is in the hard case cover . I had to abandon the hard case for the phone because it was too much of a hassle to be remoiving the hard case off everytime I put it in the car mount . I would of give it a higher rating if I did n't have to remove the hard case for the phone so the phone could be inserted in the mount .
5 #### Worked well , along with a Porter - Cable buffer to remove serious oxidation from the gel coat finish on our travel trailer , and then restore a bright shine .
5 #### The battery works in the phone like a brand new battery . Not sure if it is brand new or not , it is very hard to tell , but it works great .
5 #### excellent article just what I expected , 100 % recommended , covers all my expectations , without details and fits perfectly well protected on the phone indicated
5 #### This is not the first time I 've used Sea Foam . It is an amazing product . My car tells me the MPG I get and everytime I use this it restores my MPG by about 1 mile per gallon . On top of that I get a little bit of a cleaner pick up . I gave one to a friend who was complaining about loss in gas mileage . He said he did n't notice a change I 'm that ( yet ) but he said his pick up in noticeably better . I also have a mechanic friend who swears by this stuff . I think it 's worth the $ 10 . It 's the only product that has noticeable improvements in my car . Give it a try .
3 #### Looks good and does the trick . However , it is VERY hard to get them to stick and stay on the wall .
3 #### A little disappointed in the advertising . The picture shows the side slots can accommodate iPhones with room to spare . But the package that we received had a photo on the pavkaginf of the old flip phones . I wonder if I hit the correct item . It is the exact same thing but is smaller than the advertised photo displays . I was able to place my iPhone 6s in the left slot but it is so tight that the outside edge of the box is protruding . I also placed an iPhone 6 in the right slot and it is also so snug that the edges protrude I have s small Kindle Fire in thdcenter slot but due to the angle of the charger hole , it must be held over the top edge . I do like that I can put the multi plug in the back section and all the cables are concealed . I 'm a little worried that the edges of the case might end up giving way due to the phones pressing against them . My iPad will not fit in any of the slots so I am laying it down in front . I feel this is s well made product but needs a few upgrades to accommodate the newer devices .
5 #### Bought this as a fuel treatment and as a cleaner via my vacuum lines in my 2006 Mazda RX8 . It has worked great ! Just follow the directions on the can . For the vacuum line cleaning I looked up a video very quickly online that told me which lines were the proper vacuum lines . The 2006 RX8 has multiple lines that need to be treated in order to clean the whole rotary engine . This canister is 16fl oz of sea foam Pros : * Works great * O2 safe * Easy to use Cons : * None Additional Considerations : Be careful when finding which lines to put this liquid into . Make sure you trust the source of information . Make sure you let it set long enough to let it work as well . Overall : 5/5 stars ( > = .5 rounds up , < .5 rounds down ) = > 5 stars If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible .
5 #### I 've been using this for a while and it works great ! Does everything it 's supposed to .
5 #### No complaints here . Fit perfect . Seems to work fine . Changed it along with fuel pump just as normal maintenance . You will need the fuel line disconnect tools in order to change this filter . Also be prepared for a mess of fuel to come out when you are removing it ! :-)
4 #### The sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good . Previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas . I especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations . Even though the screen fogs the LCD is still readbale . The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price is a bit high for a shower radio .
4 #### Some musicians will tell you that multi - effects are for beginners . While I used this many years ago , single pedals were not giving me the distortion and octave tones that this unit can manage , so I came back to the Boss ME-50B. It has everything I need and a bunch of stuff I 'll never use . I loop it through a SansAmp VT Deluxe so I can cut the Boss and its " always - on EQ " when I do n't need an effect . If I could bypass the EQ , I would give it 5 stars . There are quite a few demo videos on YouTube . I suggest you watch some of them if you;re on the fence . It 's the best multi - effects unit for bass that I have ever used .
1 #### Had to return item , stopped working the next day after receiving it .
5 #### A must have if you have those special size batteries for the flashlights .
5 #### This was a great purchase at a great price ! ! Product is very sturdy and saves my phone from any damage ! !
5 #### Bought this for my wife , she is the photographer in the family . Time for her to have a decent camera . Works as we expected .
5 #### currently holding my start on the wall . nice and firm .
5 #### This remote release unit works like a charm on my older Canon camera . Looking forward to using it during the 2017 Solar eclipse !
5 #### I 've had one of these for many years now . Bought a new car , wanted to add another one to it , so I was happy to find this . Hangs unobtrusively , unlike many things that use the vents , and does n't block air flow . It can be hung on any type of vent , it looks like , with the attached clip and and then another included vent clip . It holds my Samsung S3 in a BIG case just fine , and the little pocket in front works to hold all sorts of small things , including a coiled charger cord .
5 #### This is such a great cable for your guitar . I use it for my for my electric acoustic guitar . It is very durable and it accomplices the color of my guitar .
3 #### After using this keyboard for several months , I have concluded that while it works pretty much as promised , sometimes a company can take an uncomplicated product like a keyboard and goose it up so much that it becomes too complicated for its purpose . That is the case with this product . My keyboard rests in a drawer and the buttons at the top of the b61 - 00002 keyboard sometimes hit the top of the drawer starting my email program etc . Plus , I could never get the 2 USB ports to work properly . Finally , I do n't type any faster on the " natural " keyboard and when friends and relatives use it , they complain bitterly . I should have stuck with a simple keyboard with all of these bells and whistles . My mistake . Not Microsoft 's . But think about this before you buy this product .
5 #### Best sound of any headphone in this price range , still the best bang - for - the - buck out there ! Very deep bass down to 10 Hz , and highs up to 20,000 Hz . Koss has been making that same diaphragm design for quite a long time , it 's tried and true . Be careful when moving the headset tension pressure adjustment softer ... you must push the switch against it 's spring FIRST , then move the ear - peace gently outward , do not force it or it may break . Folds up compact and has a carrying pouch . Otherwise nice comfort , nice price , GREAT sound .
5 #### I replaced my Yellow smiley face covers for these and they look awesome ! Nothing was wrong with the originals , but I have a yellow Jeep and it was too much yellow for me . MADE IN THE USA , plus you get a free sticker with each one , for those who like stickers . Excellent product . ( 2002 Jeep Wrangler )
5 #### This replacement cord works perfectly for my Passport 8500 . All functions are working without issue . Recommend this as a replacement for a broken or worn out cord .
1 #### I had used these before and needed one for a quick scuba trip . I do n't know if this one was just bad or what - but it leaked ruining the camera and all of the film . I most likely wo n't be purchasing these again
5 #### so I had this item installed for me , the instructions were succinct but complete . I was nervous with the step that requires you to heat the plastic portion of the frame , so I ended up taking this item in to my local mall and having a guy there replace the screen for me on my iPhone 3GS . This item arrived with all the required items so he did not need to add any additional cost besides labor . For the price , I paid less this way and the screen quality is fantastic , just what you would expect from an apple product . If you are confident installing your own screen , I can recommend this item , if you are not , I would check if your local mall screen replacement guy will allow you to bring your own hardware , in my case I paid less to get my hardware from amazon .
5 #### They are just picks , fast shipping , nice material , not a lot to say about them , they are not the softest nor even the hardest picks out there .
5 #### I ve used Elixer forever but decided to try these for a change . Although they 're good strings i prefer the Elixer . But I guess guitar strings are like everything else it comes down to personal preference . I will say these do not meet the soft feel as described . However all in all they 're good sounding strings .
5 #### Just like it 's predecessor ( for the 3GS ) this holster for the 4S is excellent . It is well constructed with strong materials and a strong springs . The phone slips in and out of the holster very easily , and yet the holster holds the phone very snugly and securely . It does not rattle , and does not pop out by accident . The belt clip is also tight and secure . I had tried holsters from about 4 other manufacturers , but this Seidio holster is well worth its much higher price . Note : Seidio also makes a similar holster for an iphone that 's enclosed in a ( Seidio ) case . That holster is not as good as this one , and DOES NOT hold the phone securely .
5 #### Elixir strings are the best . I 've always used Elixir ever since I first used them around 5 years ago . These newer ones are even better . Sounds great , feels great and did I mention that it sounds great ! ! Very long lasting . Because I live in a part of the world that do n't have these and are hard to come by the last set of elixir I had on my guitar was on there for more than a year ..... and it still sounded great .
4 #### This is a good replacement for my original and pitted euro headlamps in my ' 79 320/6 E21 . Exact fit but please note that this is for ONE headlamp and not 2 . The ad should really just show one lamp and not two . The description is clear so read carefully .
5 #### I had the predecessor to this model for a year or two ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Plantronics - Voyager-510 - Bluetooth - Headset - with - USB - Dock / dp / B000G6UE2W / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with USB Dock</a > ) , gave it to my mom , and upgraded to this one ( back 2009 ? ) . After more than a year the " new " headset is still going strong . Good sound quality . Good battery life . Good range . I will say that the PRO cost about half again more than the 510 did , and the battery may not last quite as long . On the other hand charging is better now that the earpiece accepts a USB charger directly ( no dock ) . Still an outstanding product , even at the higher price . After having two less - than - stellar experiences with Motorola products , it 's refreshing to find the Plantronics bluetooth wireless headsets so well made .
3 #### The pre - made holes are a lot bigger than the holes on the hood . I had to make my own holes to make it work , once i did that it fitted perfectly ,
5 #### Strings are great . Put these on a borrowed Ovation Celebrity . The heavy bottom helps with the trebly sound from a plastic backed guitar . Time will tell about the longevity of the coating . These are my first coated strings .
4 #### D'Addarion never let me down .... I've used it for over 12 years ! without any complaint .
4 #### fits my 2014 Toyota tundra well . works as advertised ... cant say that much these days
2 #### Had to re - thread the mounting screw holes in order for them to screw in . Having to keep re - tighten the unit because vibration causes it to come apart . Very disappointed . Expected more from Holley but it looks like their manufacturing is now getting done by cheap labor like everyone else .
3 #### I 'm somewhat disappointed it Netgears quality control . All that needs to power the unit down is to bump it . The switch side of the transformer has a weird fit to it . It has to be pushed in very tight like something is holding it back . Once in , it works fine until even a slight bump will dislodge it and power the unit off . It 's out of the way now so it does n't get bumped and works fine . It was kind of a pain while setting my system up and moving things around but now that it 's stable , it 's fine .
2 #### Very ordinary suctions , but strong . Can adjust the angle and height . Overall well adjustable . BUT : slides on the lap . The instruction booklet says put something under your foot to bring the leg up if it slides ! ! ! ! If I wanted to put something under my foot , why would I buy a guitar support ? ? ? ? Basically it has been impractical and unusable for me due to constant sliding .
4 #### I bought this Motorola headset about a month ago and my observations are : 1 ) It was very easy to synch this up to my iPhone . 2 ) Since I am not a heavy cell phone user , I usually have my headset turned off to conserve on battery life . When I get a call , I open the mouthpiece and it instantly connects and automatically answers the call . 3 ) The battery does not seem to last very long . Since I usually have it turned off , and I only use it for about 20 minutes a week , the battery only lasts about a week . 4 ) Sound is very clear and volume is really good . 5 ) Person on other end of my call can not tell I am on a headset . 6 ) Perfectly comfortable , even if wearing glasses . 7 ) If battery dies while in the middle of a call , the call does not drop but you just have to grab your handset real quick . Not practical if it happens while driving . 8) Completely re - charges in about an hour , maybe less . Overall opinion : This is a very nice and inexpensive device . The only reason I did not give it five stars is due to the battery life . I just make sure I charge it once a week so I do n't have any problems with dropping a call .
5 #### Great product for the price I purchase it for a friend and they love it .
5 #### IT WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO MAKE MY STEEL GUITAL MOAN AND SOUND LIKE THE PROS . I REALLY LIKE THE SLIDE .
3 #### This conditioner is highly recommended by everyone , but I found it leaves a bit of a sticky residual that I found unpleasant . I tried buffing the leather a after the conditioner has dried , but still a bit sticky , especially on the steering wheel . I guess it 's better than leaving the leather unprotected , but I 'm searching for a better product ...
4 #### It is nice to have color coded cables in order to keep track of what goes where . I recently rewired my office and have now color - coded everything , and it is making things MUCH easier . It 's nice to know the external network drive is purple , and the networked printer is yellow , etc ...
5 #### have used this product numerous times with computer to connect different devices . would recommend to friends and family , good customer service
5 #### I needed a capo for my nylon string Taylor guitar , and this capo really fit the bill . I had tried both of the capos that I use on my steel string guitars , but neither of them worked without some significant buzzing on my A string , and making my B string out of tune . This capo worked perfectly the first time I used it , without any moving around searching for the sweet spot and staying perfectly in tune . It 's also a little wider than most capos , so it will work on a true wide , flat classical neck . If you need to capo your nylon strings , you ca n't do any better than this ... definitely worth the money .
4 #### Bought this for my 2015 Ford E450 and it fits great , would buy this again .
5 #### Ordered two sets . Simple to install and looks very neat . I 'll use this again .
4 #### Not that east to install ... Start at the top of the wheel and work your way down the sides of the steering wheel , you will need a strong blunt object to help stretch the cover to the bottom of the wheel ..... and do n't do what I did and install upside down . I thought something was wrong after installing and did n't figure it out for a few days ... make sure that the Chevy logo ( yellow ) on the cover are at 10 pm and 2 pm on a clock . As seen in the picture .
5 #### I have ordered 2 pcs of this XLR cable for my MXL 990/991 condenser mic . It was a relieve when I plugged it on and it is working . I was worried because here in Bahrain , music store charges $ 40 for these cables . I got mine in very reasonable price . This is a above average XLR cables and I recommend it for people who have tight budget but needs quality .
5 #### Arrived quickly , and met all my expectations . Heavy duty is for certain , they fit great on my popup camper and will keep the mud off my stabilizer jacks this camping season !
5 #### These have got to be the best in dash cigarette sockets made . I 've purchased 4 of the for different projects . If you do n't like the 2 screw face plate it can be removed and use it without
5 #### I have had a pair of these for 7 - 8 years that I use at the gym ( running and lifting weights ) 2 - 3 days a week . I throw them in my gym back , they rattle around in the trunk of my car year round and they never miss a beat and still going strong . I would say nearly bullet proof as I have broken man other headphones in my day in this same usage . I have replaced the ear pads once ( bought 6 sets of them on amazon for around $ 5 ) . The sound quality is also so much better than any ear buds I have ever had as well , plus they fold up small and fit in the pocket of my gym shorts . I can not imagine a better pair for anywhere near this price .
5 #### Shred a credit card statement , the DSL drops . The cordless phone rings , the DSL drops . Turn on a lamp ( with CFL bulbs ) , the DSL drops . After trying all the usual fixes ( plug the DSL gateway into a separate circuit with its own surge suppressor power strip , move it farther away from the cordless phone , coil up the slack in the DSL modem cable ) it became clear we needed something even stronger . If this Furman power strip can filter out power line noise for DJs and musicians , could it do the same for computer gear ? Yes . I even thrash - tested it by rapidly flipping the reverse switch on the document shredder to bombard the room with EMI mini - bursts , calling my home phone from my iPhone and flickering the lights on and off . The line stayed up , and has done so since I replaced the wimpy power strip with this one . The faster your DSL line , the more you need this kind of power protection . It wo n't fix problems on the DSL line itself , but it will deliver clean noise - free power to your DSL modem or gateway , and many times , that 's all you need .
5 #### love this item ca n't go wrong . Works as described . What else can I say it does what it suppose to do
1 #### I ordered foru iPhone 4 but it only works with component cables ( the ones with 3 colors for video ) . These are composite cables with one video connector . Not iPhone 4 compatable ! ! !
4 #### The build quality and functionality of this motorola bluetooth headset is very excpetional . It pairs up in seconds to my iPhone . The fit is good and also the calls seem very clear for the person on the other end and for me . The battery life is pretty good too . I can definitely recommend this headeset for fellow iPhone users .
5 #### Unbelievable traction on my 4x2 ! Get these instead of the 4 link ones !
5 #### Good case with soft feel in hand has good grip and very protective . excellent for heavy handed people , or people with the dropsies .
5 #### Needed a general lens for a wedding after battling with switching between the 20 - 35 and 70 - 200 . This one fit the bill on my Canon 10D. Most of my shots were done at f16 , but even the ones wide open seemed to come out as I had intended , with a little PhotoShopping at 50 percent . Glad I got this lens ! Of course , with a boatload of dough , I 'd probably get two camera bodies , matching flashes and a lens on each . Until I earn enough , it 's this lens for sure .
3 #### I used these film to test my newly acquired vintage camera , and I was satisfied for the result . The color is okay , as the Fuji films are noted for superb color .
4 #### I 'm not sure what " helmet bag " features there are out there that I 'm missing , so I 'm giving this 4 stars on the assumption that somewhere there is a helmet bag with , like ... I dunno ... something super convenient that I have n't even thought of yet . But for the purpose of holding a helmet , this bag is functional and sturdy enough . And the inside is cozy and soft , so it wo n't scratch the thing up .
4 #### I own several of these and they all behave the same way . They are very long and fit a bit loosely though , there has never been a connection issue for me . You 're just going to notice a tiny slant when using them . The switch is quite and smooth . All my wires , cheap and expensive , link up well . They are also very light weight . They will add some noise to your signal that you will only notice in studio use . It 's not a huge amount and it can be easily removed but , for most applications , a studio engineer will prefer a clean signal to a convenient one . Still , If I 'm working with an artist that ca n't settle down if he / she does n't have a switch , I 'll do what I have to do to keep the peace and record the piece .
5 #### Beautiful . It looks stunning on the front of my escalade , and for a fraction of what the dealer wanted for the exact same item . Thanks amazon for your wonderful deals .
4 #### I believe it works as adverted . Either that or the elves fixed my tranni
5 #### I bought that phone for one of my friends And he said it was very good The sipping time take longer than I expect , But it 's ok
3 #### Really good quality reeds they last very long once you get your hands on a great one
5 #### I 'm not an ear - bud guy , I like the old fashioned lightweight headphones . The Sony 's are getting phased out , so I tried these and could n't be happier . They are comfortable to wear ( and I have a big noggin ) and sound as good as expected watching vids on my iPad or listen to music while doing other stuff on it . I know " sounds good " is totally subjective and FWIW , I do audio editing and mixing on PreSonus Studio One software with a $ 350 pair of studio headphones , so for casual listening I expect something pretty decent . These fit the bill ESPECIALLY considering the price .
4 #### My Blackberry Curve fits well in this nicely - padded , soft leather case . The magnetic closure is secure and the elastic on the sides has enough give to allow a snug fit as well as easy removal of the Curve . However , this case does not put the Blackberry to sleep when the Blackberry is slid into it . That 's important to me to improve battery life and prevent accidental dialing of calls . If that is n't important to you , this is a great case at a great price .
2 #### Did n't last 6 months . Developed a crackle / short under light usage .
5 #### I purchased two for these for my Sony digital point and shoot camera because the original ones died . They work very well and are listed at a good price , certainly much less than the replacement Sony batteries .
5 #### I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP-10 that came with my guitar . The Squier had no effects , just a clean channel and an overdrive button . I could n't afford a bunch of pedals , but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar . I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try . It is Awesome ! For such a small amp , the output is plenty loud for practicing at home , and it runs on batteries , too , so I can take it anywhere . The effects are better than I 'd hoped for . This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer , but for an intermediate level guitarist ( like me ) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family , this is the amp to get . It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus , flanger , phaser , or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay . I 'm one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that I have the time . I do n't need the deafening stacks that the kids like . I love this amp .
3 #### Seemed to do it 's stated job . We have a diesel work truck that needed it 's power steering system flushed and this seemed to help it out some . Better than spending time and money on new parts that 's for sure .
5 #### I bought Dominant string too , but the sound became too warm and lost clear sound . D'Addario Prelude Violin String sounds better .
5 #### Easy to read and understand , good IPB 's and resonable price . Pays for itself in one job .
1 #### Power cable did n't work , the loose connection resulted in the radio powering down every time i moved the cable . But even then when I tried the battery attachment even that did not work due to small misaligned metal connector parts . Its just plain garbage .
4 #### Good patches overall . Easy to put on , comes with two per pack . Although felt marks do show on it relatively quickly , it 's still a good protective cover . Would recommend .
3 #### The 4 rolls came in an unmarked cellophane wrap and did not have the expiration date noted for the rolls . That was what I was interested in knowing . If they had come in the Fuji packaging as noted then it would have had the expiration dates printed on the packaging . I would not have bought them if I know they came in that manner . Please do not mislead us this way . Otherwise I 'll look elsewhere for these items .
4 #### I like this case because it is very lightweight and does n't add much bulk to your phone . The case protects my phone from scratches .
5 #### The little zippered pouches that come with most mics are nice , but offer little protection from anything but dust . The core of this case is simple stiff foam with five holes that go from top to ( nearly ) bottom . Four of the holes are round , the perfect size for a 57 or 58 . There 's a fifth cavity which you can use for small accessories , or another fifth microphone . If you 're using a square mic like a e609 or e906 that 'll fit in there nicely as well . The holes stop short of the bottom of the case , so the mics are actually surrounded by foam on all sides . The lid closes pretty snugly when zippered shut . Nothing is moving around in there . There 's a zippered front pocket with a flat zippered pouch on front of that . Aside from the microphones in the holes , you wo n't be able to fit much more in the GM-4 other than maybe a few microphone clips , guitar picks , or handhend recorder . I like this case because it is small , simple , and very well - padded . I know that I can keep this with my gear and I 've got an array of mics ready to go without fumbling with boxes or milk crates . The denim seems very durable , and the stitching is solid .
5 #### never had a problem . liked the phone but everything gets old . but if your looking for the charger there you go
4 #### This bean - bag type stand keeps my iPhone upright as well as hands - free and scratch - free ... and it can be molded to pretty much any base , including the tip of your knee ! the suede - like fabric picks up every little piece of lint , but I suppose a more - lint - free afbric would n't keep as good of a hold on my precious iPhone !
1 #### After charging overnight , I paired this with my HTC 8525 PDA phone from Cingular ( AT&T ) . Unless I am willing to hold the phone next to the headset , the Bluetooth connection gets very noisy and will likely drop / disconnect . This not only looks ridiculous , but does n't qualify as hands - free . It does n't matter how good the sound quality of the headset might be if the device ca n't maintain a wireless connection . To be fair , I paired the headset with other ( different ) phones and my Apple MacBook Pro . ( All of the tested phones and my laptop have worked with other headsets from Jawbone ( I & II ) , Blue Ant ( Z9 & Z9i ) , Motorola ( H12 ) , and Plantronics ( 925)--most at distances of 20 feet or more . ) I may try another unit in a few months , hoping that I just received a defective one or that a software upgrade may improve the radio range .
5 #### Item was as described by seller , no problems , work fine
5 #### Read all the reviews . Read the web sites . This is a very inexpensive device . You can use it for most computer tasks . You can control hardware with it . It comes with Mathematica now . Just buy one . Or three . You 'll love it . Remember to get an SD card , a power supply , and , if you do n't already have them , a keyboard , a mouse , and an HDMI - capable monitor .
5 #### These jazz 3 nylon stiffos are perfect for very fast picking with a heavy , deep tone . I have been playing for years with nothing but tortex picks , but am very satisfied with the sound of these picks . More subtle than the tortex jazz 3 's , but if you 're looking for a deeper tone , these picks are your guy .
5 #### This is a good pickup , I got it for my acoustic guitar to play with Rocksmith 2014 . It works , but is very quiet . Recommend getting this and an amp to plug into the RealTune wire that comes with that game .
5 #### This stuff is amazing . I was told I needed a whole new rear axle to fix the vibration at 40 - 50 mph that felt like driving over rumble strips . Poured this in and drove the truck ( 2000 GMC Sierra 2500 ) and it instantly fixed it . I swear by lube guard now . I 'm gon na start pouring some in my beers for good health and to prevent body shudder ...
5 #### Used this on my flat finish Taylor . Spruced it right up . looked like it was brand new again . Highly recommended .
5 #### I bought this after lightning hit my house , traveled through all the network cabling , and took out every device in it`s path . I got paranoid about the cheap power strip on my $ 1700 monitors , so this replaced that(those were fine ) . It did get to my high end recording computer , and took out the Ethernet port , but it stopped it there(whew ) . So I just had to get an Ethernet card and all was good . But I did lose all FIOS boxes , 2 flat screen TVs , 1 home theater , 1 internet router , all FIOS equipment , so I went on an upgrade rampage for protection . Not sure if anything will stop lightning , but some things that had better protection were spared .
5 #### A must have in Alaska . Exact fit for ' 97 Explorer .
5 #### I bought the Panasonic RP - HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port a year back as a replacement for the earphones that came with my Sansa Clip - Plus mp3 player . I also bought the Sennheiser HD 202 along with them . I returned the Sennheisers within a month because they gave me blisters but I kept these ones . That should vouch for how good these headphones really are . Their sound reproduction is excellent and they are very light - weight and comfortable . My Sansa earphones slip off whenever they get a chance , but these stay on my head . Okay , so I do n't jog or run with these on , but a very fast walk does not dislodge them . The bass is excellent , the mid - range is very lively and the high - frequencies are clear . They match the Sennheiser HD 202 in sound quality and are less than 1/4th the price . I feel like these headphones were probably the best value for all the $ 5s I have ever spent online .
5 #### I have one that I have had for about three years which still works great . I have bought a second for myself and my coworkers to use at school and that one works just as well .
5 #### great tool to have because its all in one and you do n't have to go searching for missing tools
5 #### Very nice for a starter guitar , have had a lot of compliments from a couple people that are going to teach me play guitar .
4 #### Very nice price for a premium lens . Wanted it for bird photography ( hobby ) . Quickly found that it needs a monopod ( or tripod ) even at higher light levels . No big problem for intended use .
5 #### espouse the contour of the phone , thick enough to absorb medium fall and keep the screen away from sharp things . I ordered a second one .
2 #### When buying charger for your cellphone make sure that you get name brand chargers is Chargers do work but not for the Evo
5 #### Last couple times I had bought cable ties they were crap . One after another would break when I tried to lock them . These work perfectly ! ! Have used about 30 already and everyone worked ! !
5 #### I have tried many other mouse products . They 're always too small or have a cord . I hate having to move the mouse around while in use . I always run out of room . NOT SO with this wonderful product . It 's size is perfect for my hand and does not cause my wrist to hurt . I can fly across the screen at the flick of a thumb . The Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel is the perfect mouse for me .
4 #### Fine binocular for the price . Takes some time to adjust it to clear individual diopter and to set it to an optimal position for both eyes . Much less convenient than a brand name powerful large binoculars . But , after all , mentioning all of the adjusting inconvenience , works fine .
3 #### I have not used this camera , rather the D360L. However , when I upgraded to Windows ME ( to take advantage of " My Pictures " and the built - in digital camera stuff ) , my camera would n't work . It was n't in the driver list , so I contacted Olympus . This was my response ( read - " does n't work - we 're not doing anything abount it " ) " The newer Olympus digital camera models -- D360L , D400Z , D450Z , D460Z , D490Z , C2000Z , C2020Z , C211Z , C2500L , C3000Z , C3030Z , and the C21 -- are not designed to use twain drivers , plug - ins , or the mini - apps to communicate with the computer . The Olympus Camedia utility software communicates with these camera models to download ( copy ) your picture files into a folder on your computer harddrive where they can be accessed by any software program that can use jpeg or tiff formatted graphic files . Only the following Olympus digital cameras are twain compliant : D200L , D220L , D300L , D320L , D340L , D340R , D500L , D600L , and D620L. Only the D200L and the D300L can not communicate using Camedia . "
5 #### Pro : An excellent all - around performer . Good deal under $ 300 . Con : Cable sub class Notes : To unleash full potential of these high impedance studio cans , you need another 1000 - 2000 dollar investment on DAC and ampiliers ( pre and/or power level ) . These cans are basically rubbish - in - rubbish - out , so forget about plugging them into your portable devices or entry level AV receivers , it will disappoint you .
1 #### Do n't buy It . I have been wearing it one month and already de area of the belt is cracked . I liked the shape , model , for my S4 with zerolemon super battery . but as I said do n't last if you use it each day .
2 #### Good portable radio Update : cigarette cord no longer works , after fuse check and change . Disappointing quality . Waste of money ! !
2 #### I ve owned dozens of mics . I waned to like this mic . I wanted to like all the mics i ve bought . This mic is bogged down and cottony sounding . I d rather use a sm58 because I would nt use this for broadcasting that s for sure . I d rather use a re20 which has more top end and is less colored and bogged down sounding . I even prefer my at2020usb over this mic . I just hope to god its good for screamers cause its not very good for anything else besides background noise cancellation and eating up gain .
5 #### Great product at Great Price Love the add on option from Amazon as I do not have a music store locally . I will use the option as I can .
4 #### This is an excellent lens for someone getting into shooting wildlife and other scenes at a distance . For the price you get terrific glass and smooth , accurate focusing . Sure , it 's not a top - of - the - line L Series . Duh . Without image stabilization you 'll certainly want a tripod to take advantage of it , but -- assuming you 're not a pro and not going to go over every image pixel by pixel -- you 're going to be happy with this . Keep its limitations in mind : tripod , good light . You 'll love it . And heck , if you decide you like wildlife photography , you can always upgrade later -- you are n't mortgaging the house for this one .
5 #### Simple product and it works for my phone , move the price .
5 #### These things are slick ! I got them on a 50 % off deal , otherwise the look of them and being on ear would have deterred me . I am sure glad they did n't . I love the look of them in person and they are padded in such a way to where no matter how long you wear them , there 's no ear pain . While I will say I do n't use headphones enough to justify $ 100 + pairs of them , these are hands down the best sounding I have ever heard . Pros : Comfortable , compact , carrying bag , amazing sound Cons : None
5 #### Lexol 's 1013 Leather Conditioner works very well in softening and protecting leather . I use on most of my leather goods except for ultra - soft leather . It can darken lighter leathers unless the leather is dyed deeply . I recommend Lexol Leather Conditioner .
4 #### This is the low gloss product I was looking for . Looks good on 4 year good tires . Have n't tried it on trim or have any endurance experience .
1 #### THE RADIO PRO505XL IS DEPICTED ON THIS WEB PAGE . WHY ARE YOU COMMENTING ON RADIOS PRO510 AND PRO520XL ? THERE WERE MAYBE 15 REVIEWS ON THE PRO505XL , WHILE THE REST IS EITHER ON THE PRO510 AND PRO520 . TRY TO MAKE AN HONEST EFFORT ON THE RADIO DEPICTED HERE . 298 TOTAL REVIEWS .
4 #### Instead of NO ways , now I have 3 ways to charge my PDA . Works fine and delivered quickly . Only caveat is that the USB adapter wo n't work with my phone USB cable to charge .
3 #### received quick and is what is advertized . had it on spare tire for 2 months , showing signs of rust spots . keep it oiled
1 #### Did n't work . This one was DOA . Amazon quickly refunded it without a problem . Just one other issue of note ... It IS possible to put this in the slot upside down . There are NO CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS on which side is up .
5 #### I bought this because cell phone signal was bad . This works great for one room . I upgraded to larger one . But if you have small house or just service bad in part of house this should work for you . Trust me it works .
4 #### great cable , but its not good near heat . my ps3 was melting the rubber but it was n't damaging it .
5 #### Put these on the band 's Yamaha Stage Custom Birch shells and wow ! Much improvement over the stock heads . We will be using Evans heads on all our kits from this point forward .
5 #### I love these . Bought one for everyone in my band .
5 #### I have been using Lexol Conditioner on all the smooth leather goods in my life for years and years . My wife drives a 2001 Lexus with the Coach leather interior that I have treated regularly and it looks new . I have a 20 year old leather motorcycle jacket that has remained soft and supple with regular treatment . I keep the leather seats in my airplane looking new and supple with it and the same with my daughter 's Honda CRV . It does not work on vinyl and will leave a gummy residue on vinyl if applied . Also be sure that you follow the directions and remove the Lexol cleaner with a moist terry cloth before applying the conditioner . A great product that has stood the test of time .
4 #### I do not know what it is , but you can buy every adapter there is and still be missing the one you need . I do use this a lot since it gives me the freedom to wander about a bit without being tethered so tightly
5 #### 5 stars for longevity . Mine ran for 7 years . It made a clicking sound that was n't as bad as the hum the Phillips makes now but if the volume is high enough , you do n't hear it .
5 #### Perfect fit for Samsung Galaxy 4 G for T - Mobile . Great protection . The case has a good feel to it without being too tacky .
4 #### I bought a larger version of this bag previously and I like the comfort of carrying in on my back . This bag I bought the Expedition 3 was used . However , it was in good shape . Nothing torn or missing . I would recommend this product .
1 #### I have had nothing but problems with this junk jack since day one . Do not buy it . Total waste of money . The handle and release mechanism has never worked correctly . The " aluminum " in the description made me think it would be a lighter weight - easier to position jack . WRONG . It 's a heavy jack and it 's a piece of sh*t .
1 #### Phone Case was DEFECTIVE ! I would like a refund . Need to reordeer another case for my new Phone . Hope to find one reasonable and affortable to be use .
5 #### This is great with my portable music stand . Very bright and lights the whole page . It keeps it shape well too .
5 #### I hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my 8 year old son because I was n't going to put the 55 " flat screen on it to find out that it failed . Fully extends out 2 feet . This was worth the money .
4 #### the side broke . i put the phone in and pushed the side that slides and it broke.i did like it and have ordered a new one
5 #### Works as expected . Arrived promptly . Packaging was rather surprising as I did n't expect it to arrive in an envelope instead of a box .
3 #### I do n't says anything else , just I waited for four weeks for this 99 cents small piece .
4 #### It 's a pretty good pedal but I was disappointed that there was no way to adjust the sensitivity directly on the device like other pedals I 've had .
4 #### K&N makes great air filters , and this kit is extremely easy to use to keep the filters working in top condition . The process of washing / degreasing then recharging with oil is simple . You just need to leave yourself some time to let the filter air dry ( do n't use air compressor to dry - you might damage the filter ) . My only wish was that these kits were a little less expensive for what they are .
5 #### I ordered this to stack 3 tiny splash cymbals , 6 , 8 and 10 inch seperated by 4 inch Gibraltor stackers and position the whole thing right over my bass drum behind and just over the top of my double toms . Its all working just like I planned , great product !
5 #### My 2 year old loves this . I bought a cheaper one and while she liked it she also broke it in one day . This one is well made and comes with a plastic case and instructions .
5 #### It serves the purpose that I needed it for . I ran out of my own cable so I could not make anymore of my own .
5 #### First unit was defective and the customer service representative sent me a replacement immediately , which was perfect . I would recommend the product and the vendor to anyone .
5 #### Love this , just wish the battery life lasted longer , I only use it to drive to and from work to be hands free , but I am constantly being reminded to " charge " it and it lasts only 1.5days , IF that long .
5 #### Works just as advertised . Spray on , leave it for 10 minutes , wash it off , and let dry . Good as new ! Great companion product to a great air cleaner product . Would highly recommend this to anyone with K&N filters .
4 #### I am a huge fan of Dunlop picks . As a strumming acoustic guitar player these Dunlops feel very comfortable between my fingers . The texture of the pick helps it stay put and not slide around much when strumming . I would 've given a 5 - star , but the ink rubbing off on my fingers does get a big annoying from time to time . All in all a great pick and highly recommended .
4 #### Needed a long neck to put fuel additive in car . Small diameter .
2 #### I read another review warning that the volume may be low with some phones , even at maximum volume and that is indeed true for me with my a nokia E61 and a motorola phone I borrowed . The motorola was actually just slighly louder and almost usable at freeway speeds , but just barely . With the nokia , at full volume I just ca n't hear well enough to make out 100 % of the conversation , and I have good hearing ( again at freeway speeds ) . I do n't understand how jabra could go through all the trouble of making this product and then skim on the amplification . Also , it is just stupid that jabra is still in the business of making custom chargers with custom plugs and voltages . This is just something I can not support , 5V mini USB or nothing ! I suggest you buy a MOTOROKR T505 instead , which is what I got for myself ( it has better volume and can transmit the call to an FM station on your radio ) .
3 #### The pins for the connections are very weak , and they bent when I tried plugging this in . I had to make new connections for the plug . Metra IMO has always been 2nd best , but it works for the price .
4 #### Used this to connect my turntable to my surround sound system and it works great . Feels like i 'm at a concert !
4 #### GOT THIS FOR MY 2008 GT MUSTANG & ITS FITS LIKE IT SAID . ITS NOT WATER PROOF BUT FOR KEEING DUST OFF AFTER A WAX JOB OR DRY STORAGE THIS IS WORKS LIKE I HOPED . CAME WITH A STOAGE BAG TOO .
4 #### Just wish this got advertised with the full range of lengths the strap can actually create . I purchased the size recommended for an alto sax - but I 'll never be able to use it for my Bari sax , as it 's extended the full length just for my alto ... guess I will just need to purchase a bigger one for the larger horn . The neoprene pad is more comfortable than my old , plain strap , and does n't slide as much , even if it does retain heat under the strap .
5 #### This is a good product , espically for the price . The cord is a little short , but it stretches where I need it to go .
5 #### I got it for my son , he still using it , so it must be good .
5 #### The cable itself is good , looks durable and works fine . The only thing I do n't like is the color . It 's kind of gray , so it looks old .
5 #### Great Product . Really goof for sound insulation and easy , although tedious , to apply . Use this stuff and forget the cheap others ,
5 #### I have been wanting a shaker for a while to play in our band . This is a good starter shaker for laying down a beat when using the Snare , Bass Drum or Djembe wo n't work . Having two shakers connected by a rubber band so they can be separated is also a useful feature . The only thing I would change is to have these shaker bodies made out metal ( aluminium ) instead of plastic . However , this might increase the cost by too much .
5 #### I 've had this bag for six and a half years . I take it with me everywhere , stuffed with laptop ( sometimes overstuffed with two laptops ) , cables , camera , and other junk . It is now , finally , starting to wear out . I am going to buy another one to get me through the next 6 years !
3 #### If you have a newer Garmin eTrex GPS with a microSD slot , this bicycle mount will not work . You need to buy the Garmin " rail mount adapter " instead . That product is cheaper and comes in 2 different sizes to fit skinny handlebars ( most mountain bikes ) and fat handlebars ( most road bikes ) . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Garmin - Rail - Mount - Adapter-010 - 10496 - 01 / dp / B000IC2I7I / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Garmin Rail Mount Adapter ( 010 - 10496 - 01)</a > < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Garmin - Large - Diameter - Rail - Mount - Adapter-010 - 10496 - 00 / dp / B00030F6OC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Garmin Large Diameter Rail Mount Adapter ( 010 - 10496 - 00)</a >
2 #### I bought many strings the last 2 weeks and this is one of them . These strings have no life in them . I like other d'addarios but not the coated one . Now I am mainly using Martin S54050,D'addario EJ13 , Or Gibson Masterbuilt 11 . All custom 11 gauge on my Seagull Rustic Mini Jumbo .
2 #### The Hosa cable I received broke after one use . I did not stress or abuse it . The electrical contact went open on the ground lug within the jack on one end of the cable . The wire broke just next to where it was soldered to the lug . I would not expect this to happen so early in use . The wire could possibly have been nicked there during fabrication and wire flexing then caused the open . After removal of the shrink - wrap , visual inspection of the solder joints , workmanship and materials showed them to be " budget " quality . You get for what you pay .
3 #### i have had better covers . the Zagg ones are top of the line and even though this works just fine i do n't think i wil order it again since zagg is much better quality for me at least . This product is ok and is cheaper than zagg but up to you how much you want to spend .
4 #### This was a very nice bluetooth headset until I lost it . since it so small , I tuck it away and now I ca n't find it ; ( . anyways , I had 2 great headset by Plantronics and samsung . both are very good , but if I had to choose , I would choose Samsung for it connects to my phone without too much hassle compare to plantronics 510 voyager , where I had to constantly reset my phone to get connect it . on the other hand Plantronics Voyager 510 voice is far superior to Samsungs ( IMO ) .
5 #### This is an official Gibson product . I have purchased " cheaper " options in the past , and have quickly realized that Gibson parts are the best for Gibson guitars . Therefore , this product fits like it should .
1 #### Here is what will happen if you buy this product : 1 : When you take it out of the box you will look at it and touch it and think " Wow , this feels and looks great ! " 2 : You will spend about 90 minutes destroying your fingers with a needle and realize you 're only 1/4 of the way done . ( I started using pliers to pull / push the needle through ) 3 : When you get to the first spoke you will realize that there is no way on God 's green Earth that this thing is going to lay flat across the spokes . 4 : You will continue lacing on the other side of the first spoke , hoping beyond hope that the cover will lay flat over the spoke . Alas , this is not the case . 5 : Overcome with disgust and shame , you will give up and cut off this cover and throw it in the trash . This cover looks fine on the round parts of the wheel . But when you get to a spoke , there 's nothing holding it flat against the wheel , so it kind of bulges out and looks awful . Do n't waste your time or money .
5 #### Outstanding , very good item to have on hand when yon need it . I did .
3 #### its a good unit but the price is a bit rough to swallow ( even though its fair ) my unit seems to work well 95 % of the time but the other 5 % it either fails to fire or its exposure drifts . the build feels weak specifically the cord . a note before you order this unit , it requires an adapter ring to mount to your lens so make sure you get the right 1
5 #### Super cool colors ! Very impressed . Really pops when it 's on my guitar .
5 #### Comfortable , compact , and with a warm , big sound . I listen to these for everything from my work - out playlist to the Goldberg Variations and I 'm always happy . After about a year of use and abuse at the gym , they finally gave out when one of the earphones got detached from the headband ( though the music still sounded fine ! ) I discovered that these headphones had a LIFETIME warranty , so I found Koss 's address and return instructions on the web , sent them back with proof of purchase ( keep those receipts ! ) , and had a brand new pair within two weeks . Now THAT 's standing behind your product . In the meantime , I 'd bought a pair of highly rated Sennheiser PX100 's for more than double what I 'd paid for the SportaPros because I really did n't expect to get a replacement pair from Koss any time soon . The Sennheisers are excellent too , and probably a little more sonically faithful . Slightly flatter , truer , and less weighted toward the bottom end . But you 'd have to listen hard to hear a difference . Go to Headroom.com for useful reviews of both .
5 #### This harness worked fine . Wires were clearly labeled so that I could solder and shrink tube them at my work station . When installing the new head unit , this snapped right into the OEM clip very easily and made for a professional , quick install .
5 #### This mic is perfect for the person who must have his / her hands free a majority of the time . I use it on an older Motorola T5500 radio . The mic comes with a strong metal clip to attach to your clothing or belt . The speaker sound quality and volume is very good and the PPT button on the mic is easy to use . The connector is a press fit so if the cord is stretched too far the connector may disconnect . A small " tie wrap " wrapped around the cord and the radio antenna will solve this issue .
4 #### I have three motorcycles , so I am always in need of tie down straps to secure them during transport . These 8 foot straps by Keeper do the job just fine . They ratchet smoothly and lock securely , while also are easy to unlock . These can be used for a variety of jobs , not just motorcycle or ATVs , and I have found multiple uses for them in the short time I 've had them . They have done everything from holding together a couple wood items I was gluing , to securing a load on a trailer bed .
5 #### This is big enough to hold the camera and all the accessories including flash and camera battery charger . The detachable ' pockets ' on the inner side of the top are great . The versatility of the removeable ' pockets ' and dividers allow for many configurations and uses .
3 #### For the most part , it just moves the dust around . It does remove some of the dust , but it is only the first step in detailing the car . You still need detailing spray and a microfiber cloth to get the job done .
5 #### I have two fiberglass boats , one 21 foot and one 24 foot so I use a lot of wax . I have not found anything I like better than this
5 #### EDC ( Every Day Carry ) is an attempt to carry useful " things " in your pockets as unobtrusively and efficient as possible an a daily basis . You would think there would be a ton of gadgets / devices that would help you achieve this goal - but 's there 's not . I 've found the P-7 Suspension Clip by tec accessories it be one of rare gems that really helps you out . The Nite Ize Eclipse Self Locking Clip is a not - to - distant second when afixed to my Droid Incredible . If you pick the right shirts , you can afixed it to neck collar or to a button up shirt . That gets a pretty big item out of you pockets . If you afix it to your pants pocket , get pants that have an pocket opening slanting down instead of horizontally . UPDATE Well , I had to retire my Droid Incredible and replace it with a Razr Maxx . Of course I ordered another Nite Ize Locking Clip . This clip , when used as intended - is a must have . It really frees up pocket space . This time I attached the clip to an Otter - box Commuter case . We 'll see how well that will work . I loved the clip on my Incredible . The Maxx is a much larger phone , so there will be some adjustments in how I 'll be able to carry it .
5 #### Be aware .. the 64ST T - Adapter is for the Meade ETX70 ONLY . If you need one for any of the other models , you want the Meade # 64 T Adapter .
5 #### These stands are truly amazing . They function perfectly for both acoustic and electric guitars and take up very little real estate in a room . They are incredibly stable and have a nice thick cushion at the top so the guitar wo n't get scratched .
5 #### Perfect for 12 - string . Clamps around the neck well no matter where . I have a 12 - string Epiphone , and found that I did n't need to adjust the screw at all . It wo n't clamp on the headstock ( I do n't believe most 12 - string capos do ) , so you 'll have to figure out where to keep it when not using it .
3 #### THE RUBBER FEELS GOOD NO SLIP . THE RED THERE IS NO PADDING SO LOOKS GOOD , JUST UNEVEN TRANSFERRING FROM RUBBER TO RED . ok it has 9/14 till now 3/16 pros : it is still on my steering wheel . still holding together Craftsmenship Cons : The Red has now turned pinkish ( red is fading ) Ill be buying something different
5 #### Excellent for a dorm which prohibits extension cords but allow surge protectors with up to 6 ft cords . Plenty of outlets for today 's electronic needs . Is large , but easy to shove/ hide under the desk . Also worked well laying on its side to reduce its footprint .
5 #### I would buy it again . This is a sturdy device that will accept a wide range of widths and thicknesses of bearings . I suggest thorough preliminary cleaning of the bearing using kerosene or similar as a final rinse , then allow to dry . This will remove dirt - laden grease that eventually will find its way into the clean , new grease in the base / cup of the packer . The process of squeezing the new grease into the bearing was easy , but a bit slow ( and during summer temps ) but was aided by placing a 25 # bag of # 6 lead shot on the top for added force - I saw a reference to using a vice , but since the packer is made of plastic , if too much pressure is applied it could break with no warning , so I would not try that . Following this method it took less than 15 minutes(not including the initial cleaning ) to repack 4 front bearings and using maybe 2 - 3 ounces of grease , and all that was necessary to store the remaining grease was to place the top on the packer , ready for the next use w/o refilling the base . OMT - this base will hold a full 16 ounces of grease , so you may want to get at least that amount .
5 #### After trying MANY wiper blades , these are my favorites . After going thru a NE Ohio winter , these blades performed well with no chattering or streaking . They still work great & will most likely continue to do so . Well worth the money !
5 #### I did not expect that all three reeds were good because usually if you get a box of 10 reeds , half of them will be too soft or too hard or not evenly made . I think that quality control of Rico Royal Reeds exceeds the standards .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Sangean - SG-622 - FM-12 - Band - Shortwave - World - Band - Radio / dp / B0000228GF / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Sangean SG-622 FM 12 Band Shortwave World Band Radio</a>&nbsp;A terrific radio for a terrific price . Solid , portable , great range of reception . It comes with SW - MW - FM . 1 note no AM or Weather Bands - this does n't matter to me but might to you . Christmas morning , I was listening to Europe . Set up & ready to go in 5 minutes . I recommend it against those of a similar price .
4 #### I have an older TotalShop air filter / recirculation system for pulling dust out of shop air . This filter is a little hard to find , but this one fits it well and is nearly identical to the original , which lasted ~10 years .
5 #### Hard to beat the price . Received these timely and they worked just fine . Why spend 5 times the price if you do n't have to .
5 #### Works for the Blackberry Storm and any other device that uses a micro USB port .
4 #### I ordered these after buying several ( supposedly decent ) pairs ( and returning them ) . I love these . The sound is so clear - they sound great even turned up very loud ( they have the capability to go much louder than I could ever stand ) Vocals are super clear , while the subtlety of the other instruments and little bell sounds and stuff on the tracks can be heard very well . Nice bass also . I am like " the princess and the pea " when it comes to comfort , and THESE THINGS ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE ! ! I can hardly feel them . I wear glasses , and other headphones pressed my glasses against my head which hurts , these do n't . I do n't think they mention it in the product description , but they do cancel alot of ambient noise -- my phone just rang , and I totally did not hear it with these on my head . Soooo .... I highly recommend these .
5 #### I 've been looking for an EQ for a while and came upon this one . I was a little hesitant due to the mixed reviews but decided to go ahead and order it . Set - up only took about 10 minutes . After adjusting the levels , I have to say it sounds pretty good ! So far I have n't had any " sticky buttons " or buttons that do n't work . Everything works fine . I will say that it lights up like a christmas tree but that adds to the cool factor . Overall very pleased with this EQ . This is a must have for anyone that likes to customize their audio .
5 #### These are less expensive than the office supply stores are selling them for and are the very same thing . Come in Brother O.E. packaging . Received them very quickly .
2 #### I tried it on my 2002 Lexus gs 300 and the results were not very good . I followed the exact directions that came with it . They improved but only for a few weeks - then they were cloudy again . Finally , i paid Lexus dealer $ 200.00 to do it with a product called BG . The result was very good , and 3 months out it continues to look very good . I do not reccomend Plastx , unless your headlights are mildly fogged . The BG is far better .
5 #### All the correct wires and color coding . Wish the wires were a bit thicker but it all works in the end .
5 #### very bright sounding for flats , but very easy on the fingers . tamed my Musicman pretty well , sounds great , great playability . nice green silks .
4 #### I use this on my desk at work , so I can see people coming in the door behind me . Perfect size ; mine did not come scratched .
5 #### After 1 year of the purchase , it works fine . No complains . I will buy another .
4 #### It was what I expected to be and works fine , thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire ?
5 #### I 've used Meguire 's cleaner wax for over two decades . The protection and finish are great . What I really like about this wax is that it does not create a build up , as using other waxes like carnuba can do over time . Reading some of the other reviews is frightening ! Please do n't mistake the work " cleaner " to mean a substitute for actually washing your car ! ! The cleaner function removes previous wax and oxidants ... but you need to carefully WASH your car before applying this , or any other polish or wax .
5 #### They were pretty simple to install as a cheap upgrade to fancy up my Mexican Strat . The string guys I had were ok , but definitely cheaper looking . I think they were giving me possible tuning issues as well , but who knows . These string guides look great and work great . No complaints .
5 #### This is a great charger . I just set it on and it charges quickly . If I need to use it I just pick it up and replace it without plugging and unplugging .
5 #### According to a friend I 'm the last person on the planet to own a VCR but I see no reason to toss something because marketers think I should . These tape off my TV , they are really cheap and I have decades old tapes that play perfectly . DVR , streaming , whatever is the latest trend is all well and good but it all costs money and is soon on to next thing . These tapes are reusable many times over or can be stored indefinitely . I know they are n't made anymore so I stocked up . Too cheap to not .
4 #### So far I am fine with it . Has good volume and clarity . Other than having to pair it every once in awhile I recommend it .
4 #### I have had more than one electronic deer alert . This is my first Hopkins Alert . It installs the same way other similar alerts install . I no longer install items like this because it requires positioning myself in and around my vehicle that I ca n't un - position myself from without help from the local medical emergency team and crane / pry bar company . The first deer alert speaker did not work . I called Hopkins and they sent me a second unit right away free of charge . Having said all that , I installed what I could , and had a local installer finish the job . The cost of the alert and the install was $ 125 . Yes it costs a few bucks if you are not handy and comfortable working on your cars electrical system . There are good and bad reviews on electronic Deer Alerts like the Hopkins Alert . I 've used this kind of device for over 15 years , and I can say that they DO WORK . All you need to have happen is to get the animals attention . They usually stop and look . This DOES happen more often than not with the alert . Nothing for sale out there is 100 % . This device has worked for me , it does make deer and other animals stop and look most of the time , and I recommend it . If it works once for you it 's worth it .
5 #### WWorks great , and with 64 GB of space available , who could complain . I use it in my DSLR with an adaptor , but the option to offload my photos to my Droid phone is great , since it is a Micro Card .
5 #### I did a test and compared it to the Shure Beta 58A. This mic is slightly less sensitive and the sound is warmer . But not necessarily better . They are both great mics .
5 #### Very nice , perfect fit , seems to hold any dirt without any problems , and stays in place . Very pleased with the liners .
5 #### I choose this item because I was looking for a present . The item was just as it was described in picture . I would definitely recommend this item to my friends and family .
5 #### Great horn for my little car . Now the big lifted F350s will hear me when they try to merge into me
5 #### Had all four of these on in 15 min . Comes with wipes to clean the paint before installing . High quality !
3 #### Works great for igniter boxes . Was hoping it would also be heavy enough to work as a electric fuel pump mount but a might small for that .
1 #### I thought buying it directly to Fishman would guarantee a good deal . But it did n't . First of all , it did n't come in a box . It came wrapped in a paper . So , when I was going to install it on my banjo , a surprise : it 's missing the blue steel shim . And I do n't live in the USA , so I 'll have to figure out a way to get a new one or improvise . It 's a shame .
5 #### Purchased from " Eforcity " Awesome price . Would have paid double if I 'd bought this at an electronics superstore . Both items arrived on time and worked just fine . I ordered the car charger and ac wall charger for my Samsung BlackjackII phone . I am giving them 5 stars .
5 #### The wire cover are half moon shape when it is up against a flat surface . It does have a locking side that is invisible when looking straight at it . I use this product for my speaker cable . It can probably fit 2 ethernet cable very snugly or 1 coax cable . It does have a very good adhesive backing . I put this along the door trim and it blends right in . I highly recommend this . BTW you can get accessories like elbows at your local hardware store like home depot .
2 #### This charger might work ok for first generation Apple or Android devices , but it does not work for newer devices such as the iPhone 4/4s/5/5s/5c , Galaxy S3/4/5 , etc ... This charger only worked for my iPod Shuffle ( 1st Gen ) , and that 's the only reason I gave it two stars . I would not buy this again .
2 #### The Power Kleen cleaner in this kit is n't nearly as effective as I expected it to be , especially considering all the intimidating warnings on the can . I had to do a lot of hand washing under the sink with water and mineral spirits , as well as liberal use of the air compressor to actually get it clean . I suppose the cleaner might have worked eventually , but I did n't have 8 hours to sit around washing a filter . The new oil ( aerosol can ) worked well and was easy to apply evenly , but the lid for it split in half on me after the can tipped over on concrete .
5 #### I ordered two of these for my wife 's new tub ( re - doing bathroom ) She gets a soaking tub , I get a small shower - steam space .... we 're all happy . Anyway , ordered these because they are about the only thing less than 3 inches around .... too big for our hands , especially when slippery . Ordered the angled and the 24 " straight . They came in just a couple days and feeling it today I was so pleased with it ...... I ordered another for my shower space . They feel great .... and feel safe too , box says up to 500 pounds . Very happy with them
1 #### Fell apart within days . Material shredded and seems feel apart . I loved the look of it and the option of horizontal or vertical . But horrible manufacturing . Horrible . I should have listened to other reviewers . I ca n't believe this product is still offered . My dog ate it before I could send it back .
2 #### Overall this headset gets the job done if you need both hands , but it does n't go above or beyond a low budget headset . If you are looking for quality , this is not the headset you need . If you just need a cheap headset , there are many out there with the same quality and much less expensive . Stay clear from this one .
4 #### Used this on the convertible top on my 2001 BMW Z3 . Top now looks like new !
5 #### Sturdy , solid piece . Using for woodblock on hihat stand . Works great . Accessible . Sounds amazing n variable .
5 #### I have owned several cases for my evo , but I have to say this is far and away the best case you can buy .
3 #### I had a very similar product to cover my internal and external screens for my LG Voyager . When I ordered this , I was under the impression that it was the FULL size of the screen , including the black surrounding frame . I was mistaken . This screen protector was only the size of the screen itself . It works perfectly fine and no scratches have occurred but I find that dirt accumulates much more easily under this smaller screen . Just be aware of this possible issue . Other than this slight detail , the protectors are fine .
5 #### Non greasy , pleasant smell , no residue , easy to use and does the job ! Always polishes , protects , cleans , nourishes , rejuvenates and conditions ! Where to start , this stuff is awesome , it has 100 's of uses ! We use it on leather furniture , car upholstery , leather jackets , motorcycle leathers , gloves , boots and shoes ! DO NOT USE ON SUEDE LEATHER ! Nothing else to say , simply brilliant leather conditioner !
5 #### They sound great and feel great . What more could be said ? I am a highly intelligent person who can pick out slight differences in sound quality , and I feel love comming from the music . I had a little trouble in a back order problem , but that is resolved now . The ones I am speaking of are a new purchase , but I had this same model of headphones previously for many years . The exterior of the padding was completely gone when I sold them , but they still sounded great . I did n't know that the quality of these headphones was uncommon , and was sad that I let my old set go , especially when I see they sell replacement ear padding . I can say that I would much rather have the Sony MDR - V600 than the Bose AE2 headphones .
5 #### I got my first Shubb capo when playing a gig . A previous touring band had left it behind and was not coming back . Score . If you plan to perform and care about staying in tune , buy this capo . It adjusts so you can get the right tension wherever placed on whatever neck . On my acoustic I loosen it a few turns capoing at 8 , tighten up a bit capoing at one . Easy and fast , can do it between songs no problem . It applies even , straight down tension all at once , not a " pinch " like the Keyser style does . Yes , you should still check your tuning , your guitar setup / intonation would have to be flawless to not need to , but you 'll have about 1 % of the tuning issues with a Shubb that you would have with a Keyser . Okay - I get it . The Keyser clips onto your headstock so easy . If you want to pass a guitar around a campfire and make noise , use your Keyser . If you want to play guitar , buy one of these or something of a similar design . Yes , you 're going to lose it . And then you 're going to buy another one . And it will be worth it . And maybe somebody else will find your other one and they will sound better . Everybody wins .
5 #### My Nokia bit the dust and I did n't want to get another one tied into a carrier so this one seemed to be what I needed . The " Moto " is easy to use , has good reception and for those who want the ' net on their phones this one gives you that capability . Battery life is more than adequate for my use since I turn it off at night . If you need a phone that does n't make coffee this is the one for you .
5 #### Works perfectly for what I wanted to do -- hook up a pro audio ( XLR ) mic to the stereo mic input on my computer . Takes the mono signal from the mic and puts it on both L&R channels . Saved me trying to jury rig the setup using XLR to 1/4 " plus adapter plugs .
5 #### Holds most of my camera and lenes . Seems to be good quality .
5 #### Covered the wires we wanted to hide and did what it was supposed to do . What more could you want !
5 #### Love this little compact powerhouse . I actually own the older unit so my review is based on that . After experiencing my share of a dead Droid , dying iPad2 and MP3 player and at the mercy of an available power outlet , I decided to take " charge " of things . Saw this little unit on Amazon and decided to give it a try . As soon as I got it , I knew it would be love at first sight . I packed it on a couple of trips I took recently , knowing that I would be out all day away from any type of power outlet . As soon as my phone was dying , I plugged it into the iTorch and I was off to the races again . I could utilize my phone right then and there or I could have just let it sit in my pack and charge up . Yes , you have to charge the unit up prior to use but its a small inconvenience compared to being at the mercy of a power outlet or even solar charger . If I could make this unit even better , I would include a hard case with a wider selection of plug adapters rather than a carrying pouch and a couple of adapters .
5 #### Nothing more to say , really , these batteries appear to be quite good and the price is much better than at the store .
5 #### Great bag . As compact as can be considering how big the camera is .
4 #### I have tried several pads for this orbital buffer . Especially those sold by Griot 's garage and I have to say that these original P / C pads work the best for me . They are soft enough , yet firm enough and much thicker than the other pads . One drawback is that they do not last any longer , but then they are cheaper than the hook and loop pads anyway .
4 #### I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more . Which , unfortunately , resulted in a lot of accidental button pushing and disconnecting calls . I saw these on Amazon and thought they were worth trying . I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error . I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise . The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear . Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset . Also , while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get . But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I do n't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear . I would recommend this product to others who find the jabra sound decent but also wish it would go in the ear a little more .
2 #### I ordered this case ( which turned out to be model 108 ) thinking it would be a little larger than my previous case which I used for my Palm Centro , but did n't fit my new Motorola Photon . Unfortunately this was the same size as my old case and is a little too snug . While I can get it to fit , it 's difficult to get it in and out , unlike with my previous phone which easily slid in and out .
5 #### Got this phone for my niece and she really likes it . It 's almost like an internet phone and she loves the touch screen and camera with flash .
2 #### Here 's the conundrum ... I have a Garmin nuvi 255 . On the POSITIVE side , with the GDB 55 , the 255 IS capable of plotting and changing your route on the fly automatically according to the traffic data it receives . The DOWNSIDE is that the traffic data it has received so far has been next to useless . For example , last Friday we traveled from Massachusetts to Maryland . Coming down the Jersey Turnpike the unit showed a small ( 1 or 3 min delay ) and kept us on the pike . Just before we reached exit 7 , we decided we 'd had enough , pressed Detour , and ended up doing something involving route 295 . When we reached our destination , we learned from those who arrived hours later that the pike had turned into a virtual parking lot and we 'd have lost hours if we 'd believed the Garmin regarding traffic . I 'd return the GDB 55 except that the traffic data really can get the 255 to change its recommendations . So , fool that I may be , I 'm going to keep working with it on the hope that the traffic data service will improve . I figure ( a ) it 's part of the price of getting in when a service is relatively new and ( b)I can always hit Detour manually as we did last weekend should we start getting anxious again . Unless you * have * to have it , however , I recommend against buying this unit until early adopters report that its performance has improved to being minimally acceptable . At the moment , it is n't !
5 #### This is the good stuff . Fuel stabilizer for any kind of fuel , ethanol or ethanol free , diesel , any octane rating . An ounce a gallon when you buy gas for your mowers and lawn equipment is a must for preserving it beyond 30 - 60 days siting in the garage . Can be used in cars and boats but mine is for lawn power equipment that is as old as 23 years for one mower and about 10 - 12 for trimmers , blowers , hedge clippers , edger , and power washer . I have used E10 , 89 Octane gas in all of the above with an ounce / gal for the gas cans and no problems strarting after winter storage . You do need to clean air filters , change plugs , and do the other maintenance too . All the power equipment dealers I go to in the Dallas area have it available for sale along wtth all the other accessories . It can even clean out gummed up carbs and engines from the inside . A $ 7 investment in a 16 oz can and save you hundreds in repair bills later .
1 #### Best to spend your $ on a Yongy . Super slow recharge and not enough power control .
5 #### I leaned out my 61 to a perfect idol in 3 minutes
5 #### Exactly as advertised . Simple and easy to use . A MUST HAVE for all K&N filter owners . What more needs to be said ?
5 #### Out of all the ones I 've tried so far this one is the most secure .
5 #### These Med - light strings brought out the base while keeping the highs . They feel good and the bottom three strings are n't any harder on your fingers than the elixir light 's .
5 #### this thing is sturdy , inexpensive , and does it 's job . no scratches or anything on my taylor . it falls over now and then but only when i run into it
4 #### Nothing fancy , just decent quality and simple installation . As may have been mentioned , one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud . Use your own . The TV I mounted with it is an older flat - panel , so it 's a little heavier than the news ones . This thing is n't fazed , and stays where I put it .
3 #### I have a 2001 Ford Focus SE and was sent this wiring harness by Crutchfield for the Installation of a new Head Unit . I had to very carefully cross reference the wiring schematics for the Stereos wiring harness , the Metra Wiring Harness and also the Wiring of the vehicle to properly mate wire to wire . Even in Doing so , The Illumination Line had to be cut from the Vehicles Stock Harness and connected directly to the Illumination lead coming off of the Alpine Head Unit . I also ran into a snag when connecting the Metra Harness that connects to the vehicles power , negative , grounds etc ... The Metra Harness is 1 Pin longer than the Focus Harness so depending on which side of the connection you were starting from when connecting all of your leads you may have ended up with the wrong combination . The Focus harness will fit off to one side . So , that is something to pay close attention to . So in the end , it will work for a Focus but you have to have all of the wiring information for all 3 things in front of you when wiring the harnesses . its not an instance like I have had in the past where all of the color coding matches up perfectly and the harness just snaps into the vehicles harness with no extra effort .
4 #### Ok , so I went for the " Vintage look and bought a " Gibson " & a " Fender " guitar strap ! When I was younger I would never have made the purchase - I would have to have a big wide black leather strap throw in some silver bling .... now that I am 54 , almost , I need the name spelled out to remind me which is which . Not a expensive all leather constructed strap , but it gets the job done & in my refined age , I think it looks bitchin !
5 #### The product is recommended for anyone looking to use it or gift it to one of your family members . Thanks
5 #### Bought this to clean my 2003 Toyota Corolla 's headlights . They were quite dirty and had that layer of film on the outside that does n't come off with just a simple washing . After using Meguiar 's cleaner though they looked drastically different and actually clear ! I have used this on my other vehicles headlights as well and I continue to be impressed at the results that come from this simple product . It is simple and easy to use by just squeezing some of the product on the headlight and rubbing it in with a cloth . I found that small circles was the most effective way of scrubbing it in and produced the best shine .
5 #### Bought mine used . When I tried it out , it worked as described . I tried at location of house with one bar then got 2 more bars when I installed it .
4 #### This cable works like I expected it . It came in on time , wrapped perfectly and it works great . The price was right too !
5 #### Very reasonably priced , solid Belkin construction , easy to connect and sounds great through my HTS . What else is there to say ?
5 #### I have a teardrop camper that I needed a fan to recirculate air inside . This fan is as quiet as can be expected yet very powerful . One additional feature I did n't know it had until it arrived was two tabs on the top of the unit so you can hang it from an RV window . The tabs swivel too so you can face the fan blowing inward or outward . This was a great surprise because I was n't sure how I 'd keep it right in front of the window to circulate the air . I would definitely purchase again .
4 #### Nice strings ........... I use them on my Taylor 814ce . They do , indeed , last longer .
1 #### Cheap enough but you get what you pay for . The cable is too thin and caused ghosting on my monitor !
5 #### I loved these strings . There is a " wet " feeling because of the nanoweb , but they are top quality . I strongly recommend them and the best of all , is that they last quite a long time !
5 #### I came from the school of thought where little emphasis was placed on subtle devices such as picks etc . However , having used these picks I am completely swayed . On electric guitar the attack is so much more pronounced and clear , the difference immediately stands out . On acoustic as well , the notes are extremely defined . I 'm glad I ordered the ' two dozen ' pack . Will order a next pack just to make sure I 've got more on hand .
5 #### On Stage has some of my favorite accessories for microphones and stands . If you want to attach a second mic to a stand this side mount boom works very well . The boom is well made and should stand up to professional use for a long time if you take care of it .
4 #### I bought this to hook into my laptop , so that I could play a nearby sound bar . I works fine .
5 #### A very well built , and stable stand . I love the design . A great hybrid of two designs .
5 #### Bought this to record our board meetings . Does an excellent job . You can hear everyone around the board table quite clearly
5 #### The Linksys Cable / DSL router works . You plug it in , connect your computer and modem to it and then add your internet username and password to the router using a simple web browser interface . That 's as hard as it gets installing this device . I 've installed several of these for clients where reliability and ease of use are key considerations . The Linksys router does what it 's supposed to simply and effectively .
5 #### Update : I contact Ernie Ball , and they shipped me a new set . They sound great ! Old Review : It broke when I was restringing it
5 #### These headphones are really flat , meaning accurate . Very good for everyday use in mastering or recording . I also have a set of RS1s that are open air and cost $ 500 in 2010 , that are superior , but open air and not isolated .
5 #### Well this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality .. . And for the price that its offered . . .i can recommend any one to just buy it .. without thinking twice . .. Cons : Not as comfortable as over the ear headphones . ..
5 #### Pretty good to lift old and new stains . Does n't smell great but it does n't linger too long , especially if you wash the carpet after removing the stain .
5 #### Perfect . Ordered 4 for 3 kids in school and 1 gamer husband . So far they are perfect !
3 #### I live out in the country where there are not alot fo towers . So I got this to see if it would help get better signal . It seemed to help alittle bit .
5 #### My drummer will be out of jail in a week , and we will be getting to work as soon as he 's free from the elite enforcement jockeys . I though it would be a nice " back to the world " present , I also remembered he broke his last pair of sticks at our last practice . They seem better than what he had ... thicker , more durable .
5 #### It works great , including the circuit breaker function . The cable has a nice solid feel to it . Recommended .
5 #### When it comes to manual hub locks , you get what you pay for . WARN hubs are made with quality materials and craftsmanship is top notch . It took less than 30 minutes to install these hubs and the fit and finish are superb . Would buy these again !
5 #### Found it on amazon at a great price . blew the local parts dealers away for the same product . Fit perfectly .
5 #### Great deal for me and another great Amazon Transaction . :-) !
4 #### as advertised . too bad they eventually break but that 's the nature of the thin wood dowels . only complaint is they are a bit pricey everywhere .
5 #### The screen protector does what it does and lasts for quite a while . I change it once about every 4 - 6 months .
5 #### If your use Rain - x this is a great price to buy it on Amazon .
5 #### I love this gadget ! This is a wonderful , sturdy , high quality MP3 - CD player . Euro design , euro quality . I researched a lot of players before I settled on this one - the price/ value ratio ca n't be beat ! The sound quality is great . Mixed encoding rates are not a problem for this player . The accessories are great too : car cassette adapter ( or if you have a home stereo , it works in that too ) car power adapter , AC adapter and headphones . The headphones are solid , not flimsy , are nice quality and are ergonomically designed to sit firmly in your ear - great for sports activities . The 100 second skip - protection works well too , I shook it like hell and it did n't skip a beat . The display is not the greatest , but usable and you get used to it . Once you use it for a while , you 'll get as to how to burn your CDs . Overall thumbs up ! Highly reccommended !
5 #### I almost always use Martin Strings on my three Martin guitars , but this set was for my grandson 's parlor guitar .. Even a less expensive guitar deserves great strings .
5 #### Used it for the Vacuum pump and work fine . good Quality
1 #### I am shocked at how cheap this product is ! I searched several brands and styles of ipod mounts and settled on this one partly because it had so many positive reviews and it looks so easy to use . I was excited to get my package today , and took the clip part out and inserted it into the vent mount . Then I went to test putting the ipod in it . One side of the clip snapped right off upon first attempt ! I did n't use excessive force , I did n't do it incorrectly as I have watched the video on the " ease of use " of this mount . It just broke off like the plastic was brittle and cheap . I 'm sending it back for a replacement to give it another shot since it got so many great reviews , maybe I just got a defective one , but this does n't give me much confidence in the quality or longevity of the product and now I have to wait yet another week to be able to mount my ipod in my car which is annoying .
4 #### 4 out of 5 only because of the slight shaking it does . I do n't really like that . I have two of these stands with 16 " crashes on each of them . The lighter crash seems to shake a little more . Also its 4 out of 5 because i believe the boom arm could be some inches longer ( 3 ? ) Reduce shaking and add 3 inches and this thing is pretty much perfect .
1 #### This would be nice but it came broken in a non - protective plastic case . It 's not even worth returning the $ 4 and some change . I would n't buy this ever again .
4 #### This is far smaller than expected . It will not hold two cameras and lenses . Only a body and very few accessories . Having said that , the build quality is excellent , or outstanding whichever is better . If you do not need a lot of equipment this bag is great . Camera with lens , flash , and a couple of smaller items will fit on the inside with pockets on the exterior for cards , cables or other small items .
5 #### This is a great product that works quite well for me . They have a prompt service , with great care . I have no reservations .
5 #### Very fast shipping ! Quality is excellent way better than expected for the price . Good quality leather . Exactly like the picture .
5 #### Added this to my Gibson Guitar Pack -- some redundancy , but I will use it up for sure .
5 #### Bought these for my 4 - year old son so he could watch movies on his tablet during car / plane trips . They 're a little big on his head , but they work nicely for as inexpensive as they are .
3 #### Seems to work ( hard to tell , though , whether it really makes any difference ) . But it 's kind of a pain in the butt to remember to keep refilling the sponge . And if you have more than one guitar ( and what serious guitarist does n't ? ) , using more than one of these just multiplies the problem . So it 's just not a practical way to go for someone who is less than fully compulsive about taking the time to humidify his instruments .
5 #### The Absorber is awesome . Do yourself a favor and buy the brand name Absorber . Previously bought an el cheapo knockoff and it began to stink after a year .
5 #### This is a vital thing in any equipment rack - ventilation . Hot air rises and needs somewhere to escape . Plus , it will add more cross strength to your rack for next to no money
1 #### Virgin Mobile is the best prepaid service provider . TracFone is just HORRIBLE ( minutes go as high as $ .50 a minute and text messages are $ .30 each and I think you have to pay to receive text messages with TracFone . With Virgin Mobile , its $ .25 a minutes for the first ten minutes of the day and $ .10 a minute after that . Text messages are $ .10 to send and free to receive . A lot of content is available at virginmobileusa.com for putting on your phone ( ringtones , celebrity voicemail greetings , MTV and Comedy Central Content , and a lot more ) . You only have to play $ 20 every three month which is A LOT cheaper than most cell phone service providers . And best of all , NO CONTRACTS ! ! ! Virgin Mobile is the way to go for prepaid phone service .
5 #### I just received the BEFSR41 last week . Had it hooked up in 15 minutes . I use Verizon DSL , and my existing network setting were the same as required by the router . Plugged the cables and the box in , checked the router settings ( no changes needed ) , rebooted the 4 PC 's ( Two on XP , two on Me ) , and made sure email and internet connections worked . They did . I have not had any of problems another reviewer had with getting to some web sites . Everything works as expected . I bought this to isolate my LAN from the internet ( WAN ) . I was using a simple hub , but that put me at risk with hackers , even with a firewall , since I wanted to share files and a printer between my PCs . Now , my router gives me my own internal IP addresses that the hackers can not see . They beat on the router , not my network .
5 #### Get this if you do n't want to change again for a few years .
1 #### These binoculars were sent back for refund .... I own a pair of bushnell 16x50 binoculars and they work just fine , but I wanted to get something that was a little stronger , so I purchased the 20x50 and after receiving them I was disappointed in them because they would not focus clearly . I followed the instructions on focussing , but they just would not focus well enough to see things clearly . There were parts that seemed to be loose and when using the focus rocker I could see the two lens wobbling . These were just poorly made . I have sent them back to Amazon for a refund .
5 #### These blind spot mirrors have been great ! With these mirrors there is n't any spot that a car can be beside me and I not see them with these bad boys ( I placed them in the bottom inside corner of each mirror i.e. the bottom left for the right side mirror and the bottom right for the left side mirror from the driver 's perspective ) ! These are 2 - 1/2 " x 3 - 3/4 " which is quite large as a side note , and they take up a good chunk of my truck 's mirror ( 98 F-150 ) so if you have a smaller car you might want to purchase the small variant of these .
5 #### Works great to regenerate your K&N air filter , cleans and then restores the filtration capabilities to the filter . Is as advertised .
5 #### I purchased this charger to prepare for a recent trip I was taking that required a 5 hour plane ride . I have an iPod Touch and I knew it would n't last for the whole flight without some backup charge . This charger did the trick ; half way through the flight , the iPod registered as being 20 % of battery levels , so I just plugged the Turbo Charge in , turned it on , and waited 10 minutes or so for it to charge . Then my iPod levels were high enough to continue for the rest of the trip . I also like the charger because it allows me to use rechargeable AA batteries , so I just brought a bunch of pre - charged batteries on the trip with me and had enough power for the full trip . I should also note , my friends used this charger on their iPods and it worked on an iPod Classic ( video ) , and iPod touch 1st generation and iPod touch 2nd generation with no problems .
5 #### If you have a bunch of time on your hands it works wonders . You will need a bunch of these for a motor home though ... it goes quick .
3 #### maybe i did n't read the description well , but i recevived something different from the picture , but it works , it 's all what matters , but the picture must be updated , because it looks nicer than the picture .
5 #### I have used this system for approximately 15 years . We have several trailers , and of course they have different hitch sizes . This system makes it so easy to change the ball . I have this system on all three of our trucks . My daughter pulls her horse trailer almost on a daily basis . Then we hook up to the flat bed for getting hay . She changes the ball and away she goes . I have purchased several of the kits and gave them to friends for gifts . Sure beats trying to find a wrench to change the ball . If you have this system you will always have the right size ball with you . I use the plastic holder . It keeps the grease from getting all over . I have a small Phillips screwdriver to help push out the pin . I am going to purchase another set at the Tulare Ag Show this February . Never had a problem with them .
5 #### I put these in the corner of my mirrors on my 2008 mazda 3 , and they have made me much more comfortable when parking ( I can see right where my wheels are in relation to the curb ) and on the highway ( great coverage of the blind spot ! )
5 #### Basic no - frills headphones for an economical price . I 've seen headphones like these at drug , electronic , and department stores for almost triple the cost . They fit well , and sound great . Standard 3.5 mm cord at standard length . If you are looking for high - end phones with noise cancelling , volume controls , blinking lights , etc ... move along .
5 #### My daughter bought this for her car . She really likes it . It is of nice quality !
5 #### 7/2017 Bought 9/2011 & they 're still perfect . Nicely made . Heavy . I know cables and these are worth cost and I would n't want anything less than these . I know these will last for 10 years .
5 #### Great strings . Great strings is all I can really say .
5 #### I use this capo over all the others . Works well and it can be clipped right on the headstock
5 #### Best thread sealant ever . Have used it to seal threads for air , residential water , gasoline , and engine coolant . Works for all of them . Requires very little time to cure . Excess can be wiped up . Have used this on hundreds of fittings with ZERO leaks .
5 #### I use this in a Garmin GPS , so speed is not critical . Works great , and the price here on Amazon was excellent !
5 #### Works perfect . Just what I needed at a good price
4 #### Headset works fine for my use and was easy to pair with my phones . I do n't stream music so have not tried that , do have it paired with two phones , and am opposed to voice control so have not tried that . I use a similar older model headset for work . I 'm accustomed to using care when rotating the mic , generally swing it upward then carefully rotate the soft rubber part to the other side , then swing the mic back down . Have never had a problem with other Voyager headsets breaking , and this one appears to be made of the same material . The package was missing the foam eartip covers . You can not return the headset " for health and safety reasons , " in my opinion probably because of the battery or contact with bodily stuff ( ear wax ) . I forget exactly how , but I found a page where you can contact Amazon and let them know parts were missing . They responded satisfactorily within a day . Too bad the page is kind of hard to find . Anyway , docked one star because of the missing items ; good thing it was not a gift . Wish the page for reporting the missing parts was more obvious but I suppose they 'd be inundated with all sorts of bogus claims if it was too easy .
5 #### I just received my radios , they are replacements for two that I had back I think 2010 . Any how they are excelent radios to use as extensions as it were for communications between a mobile unit and or a base station .
4 #### Might need to get a couple of these to double the length to account for the area where you might have parked your car . Also , the mount holes in the top corners are thin and could be easily be pulled of the wall with screws staying in the wall . Bumpers are hollow with a web structure , works well for absorbing impact from doors .
5 #### I 've been playing for 40 years , and have tried many strings . These are my hands - down favorite electric strings . First , the pure nickel windings have a distinct warm yet bold tone unmatched by those that are nickel - plated ( which is most mainstream strings ) . The tone makes a huge difference on any guitar , if one is after classic rock and blues sound . The pure nickel is also gentler on your frets . Second , for whatever reason , these Gibson Pure Nickel strings last WAY longer than any others I have used . They resist breakage and retain their tone better than the rest . I use them on all of my electrics on which I use this gauge , regardless of guitar brand . NOTE TO GIBSON : please start making these in 9.5 gauge sets ! At one time , all electric strings used pure nickel windings . Then the cost of nickel material increased , causing string makers to use plating instead of pure nickel . Not all pure nickel strings are this good . The hex core construction of these is a big advantage , keeps the windings from shifting and solidifies the tone . Shop for the best price . The Gibson Vintage Reissue strings are well worth the small additional cost over conventional plated strings .
2 #### It does not work very well . Not a very good buy , maybe has to do with the phone . Was not a good buy .
5 #### I went through two other brands of strings before trying these . I should have known they would stand out , since their guitar strings are the ones I always go back to . These strings bring out the tone in my mandolin like no other set and have lasted twice as long .
4 #### I did enjoy this book ! I thought the author did a great job telling a story and hooking me from the beginning . Once I started this book , I wanted to know how it would end . The author did a great job of having the main character slowly mature . I also enjoyed that the main girl got to finish what she started . The only thing I personally found to be annoying was the character calling his dad , daddy .
5 #### I got these for my friend and he said it works very well . You can hear very clearly and you can be heard just the same .
5 #### Outstanding muffler ! Used with 1.9 Fiat engine with turbo and the sound is fantastic , very low tune and at excellent balanced noise level .
5 #### Bought four sets of these phones for $ 25 apiece on the Amazon website . This price is 1/2 of the MSRP ! I have owned Porta - Pros for nearly 30 years . Just recently , I had the chance to compare them with super high end ' phones costing $ 350 and $ 1350 ( ! ) . Both were over the ear models . While these pricey ' phones delivered superb sound , the difference from the Koss ' phones , in my opinion did not justify spending 12 to 40 times as much money ! More importantly , the over the ear models proved extremely uncomfortable , in my case producing jaw pain after a relatively short period on my head , and so severe that I had to reach for the bottle of Motrin . By contrast , the Koss ' phones , with adjustable ear pressure , are supremely comfortable . I can wear them for hours without any problems . Finally , Koss stands by their lifetime guarantee- no questions asked , even if you mistakenly sit on them . In summary , you absolutely will love this headphone . Even the Stereophile gurus acknowledge the incredible price / performance ratio of this stellar product . Unconditionally recommended !
5 #### I run a studio and my house drummer had me buy new heads ( both top and bottom ) for the kit . Emperors and Ambassadors . All the heads came quickly , in brand new , undamaged condition and the drums sound great . Pricing was comparable to the online retailers ( a few dollars cheaper in some cases ) .
4 #### This Is a Good bag , its really good for the beginner Camera Guy , i just got a rebel camera , and so far i can fit the camera and 2 other lenses in , ( really kinda looks like its made just for the Rebel slr cams nothing bigger ) i may be able to fit 2 more lenses depending on the size , i do n't have enough room for my cords like my adapters and things . i can kinda fit my charger inside , i can fit my sd cards inside as well , but its worth it , has a fanny pack strap as well as the shoulder strap
5 #### I have a Electric Bass Guitar and needed to Capo . After looking at " reviews " I like this one the best . I 'm very happy with it and it works great without any problems . The size is " Just Right " , not too small or Big ...
5 #### 210,000miles on 2006 Honda CR - V. I split into 3rds . Put in gas tank , crankcase , brake vacuum ( while running ) ( very easy)it smoked like crazy afterwards , I ran it hard while it smoked , drove on highway for 50 miles . When I finally stopped at a red light , I was amazed at how quiet and smooth the idle was . It 's so quiet now ! I ca n't feel the motor!1 time user as of today .
5 #### Great little radio , take it to football games , fits nicely in my coat pocket
4 #### This tool can be a pain , but for the price , it should definitely be something worth trying out . It does n't stay suctioned very well , especially if oil can get between the suction and valve , causing it to pop off really easily . After the 3rd valve , I sort of got used to it and figured out ways to keep it sticking longer . I d dry both surfaces , and wipe of areas . I 'd work the tool in a way it stayed on longer when I spin it . Yes it 's a pain , but I 'd rather feel it working and lapping by hand than using a drill and what not . A drill would be faster , but as a first time engine restorer , I wanted to do it the hard way first to make sure I do it correctly . I think I 'll try a rubber hose / tube and stick it on the opposite end and spin it that way next time . I think I can still get a feel of lapping the valve , and a tube / hose would stay on easier . But as far as this tool goes , just be patient , and know that the suction is n't very good . But you 'll get used to it and learn to make it work .
4 #### It was good except for making my phone hot . But otherwise I was very happy with it
5 #### I tend to sweat when I play , so coated strings are a necessity for me . These are as good as any coated string on the market , I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings . Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string . These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well . Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play ! Oh , and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them . The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it .
5 #### These binoculars are a little larger than I expected , but man they work GREAT ! ! ! They are not quite twice the size of most compact nocs , but the size difference is not a real issue , considering how well they work ! They are not too heavy or too big for my needs ( concerts & sports ) . Highly recommend !
5 #### Especially at this price . Connectors feel SOLID like they can take a bit more abuse than others in this price range .
3 #### The sound is what you 'd expect from D Addario . The strings could n't hold a tune for very long though it seems . And that 's wtih a Khaler bridge and nut lock . Other than that they 're super bright . * If you play ANYTHING heavy , I personally do n't recommend these . The light top 's are bologna in my opinion . As well as the regular Jazzy sound of D Addario . Go with DR if you 're playing anything heavy .
4 #### This is a nice product . I have a nokia surge and film that is made for it cost so much that I had to look elsewhere . My girlfriend has a pantech crossover and needed a protective film too . So this is where I went . They fit almost everything and do it very nicely . They only drawback is it takes a bit of time to trim them to fit . Great product ! !
4 #### These string feel amazing . They are very malleable letting you pluck , pull , and slide all day . The tone is perfectly acceptable but not as deep and resonant as i would have liked . Eventually swapped them out for Custom Lights by D'add which are not near a buttery as these unfortunately .
1 #### Two months later , the phone is dead and will not charge . It is going to cost too much to send it back so i will just accept my losses .
5 #### Most trombonist do n't use mutes because they usually do n't fit in the trombone case . If you are going to bring a mute to the gig in my opinion the Clear tone Trombone Mute is your best choice . Use it with a plunger and you have a cup mute and play into softly and it works as a straight mute .
2 #### Not as good as my old radio shack model which is 10 years old . This unit is n't as strong on receiving , even with a new antenna . It also picked up ignition noise . The squelch had to be set to low noise just to get any reception at all . The weather alert was also weak . I sent it back and am using the old radio shack model .
3 #### I have to always have medical cards on me , as well as AAA , so it would have been nice if Anker had accounted for that as I am sure people using this case do not only own two cards . Cards stick out and will be snapping against your screen , so make sure you have a nice screen protector on . As for the rest of the case , it 's good quality feel , and as it begins to wear it feels premium . I like I can pull back the cushion and touch the plastic backing to feel the cpu temperature on my phone and air it out if it 's hot . It bends in different productive ways . The snap make it feel secured in a purse or bag , and the case seems durable . Snapped shut the phone may endure a few drops and extreme situations as long as you do n't bring too many cards as it pushes the case open . I 'd recommend if you need a quality case cheap , and do n't like otterbox . Can snap it open backwards if you need it open for GPS in the car .
5 #### Works great , very snug on the connector . Why they send two I am not sure ? ? ? As other reviewers have pointed out you can not put the other one on the trailer side , this is only a cover for the vehicles plug . But I did n't need a trailer side cover , so I have an extra .
5 #### It 's not rocket science and these folks got it right . I 've seen companies get it wrong , but there 's no problem with this implementation .
1 #### Ordered two . From the start I was having trouble with the LCDs . This is n't the first time I have replaced pieces for my iphone , and not the first LCDs I have ordered ( never from this seller ) . The first one went totally white on my screen . Only when I squeezed the top near the camera would it show my screen . Eventually after hitting the screen with my hands ( yes I know ) , the screen started working . A week later it went completely white and would n't work again . Second LCD never worked from the start . Went to apple to make sure it was the LCDs and not the bottom portion of the phones . They confirmed the faulty LCDs and am returning these asap .
5 #### works great , good price . The Speck case fits great and functions great . the buttons are easy to push . the only problem is the silence button on the side is a little covered up by the case , but it 's still a great case
5 #### Always use these for my acoustic , great crisp sound and last a very long time .
5 #### The cable is a Monster ... Nice weight and the connectors are super tight and gold ... The Amazon price was unbelievably low ... If you need this cable BUY IT ! ! !
4 #### This power center provided everything I need for my home theater setup . The only feature I wish it had is a shutoff option for certain accessories to eliminate phantom power .
5 #### I would guess ... 22 OR 24 GAUGE ? Ok , good enough .. Nice for the shorter connections , less entanglement .. It 's 14 " so if you need longer ones , keep this in mind . Keep them in hand anyway . You can never have too many .
5 #### painted my ugly drum smoker with this and it looks great .
5 #### Flash on Canon Rebel was not bright enough . This flash has filled the void . Wish it was a little cheaper though .
4 #### It works well . It does leave some marks on the tablet glass but it could be the gorilla glass on my tablet . I recommend this product .
5 #### No fuss , no muss , although i do wish , since they 're already manufacturer specific , that they would already be soldered/ capped ... but i guess that s what crutchfield is for .
5 #### Cheapest way to buy activation . I have never had to buy extra minutes or data , but I 'm not on my phone constantly , either . If you have your tracfone for safety and emergencies , this might be the way to go .
3 #### This phone was okay , but would freeze up on my mom a lot when she would use it . Not sure if I would buy it again .
5 #### Got a new Taylor 150e for duet gigs . Needed a good quality capo . Very happy with this one .
4 #### These are what I 've used for years . Not too expensive and sound great ! You can spend more money , but for what they cost Ernie Ball works for me !
5 #### If ever there was a case you wanted to just drop your Blackberry into a pod to charge and not worry about messing with cables or plugs , this is the case . It sits perfectly in the pod and charges every single time . Excellent product if you have multiple areas in your home or office where you set your Blackberry down . Keeps your Blackberry constantly at full charge .
5 #### I got this for my solar set - up . I just ordered 2 more . these are good holders , strong plastic , tight connectors . well worth the price .
5 #### they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a VERY long time and their sound is great , these strings are not focused on performance but endurance , best string I 've ever played !
5 #### These fit perfectly on my samsung . Great quality product . I would re order these in a heartbeat . Thanks so much
4 #### I like them . May try the 2 ply next time I replace my heads , but these sound great .
5 #### A Canon T2i with spare lens will fit tight , however , this is advantageous if it gets dropped or slammed . Top cover has flap to improve water resistency . Everything will fit . Also has separate fanny strap , if that 's what you are into .
4 #### I did n't give 5 stars just because I know there are better strings out there , but these strings are a great value and would n't hesitate to buy them again . In fact , I have already bought them several times . One little thing I appreciate about these strings is the different colored ends that makes them easy to identify .
5 #### These have been comfortable . I love the locking clip both because it is secure on the horn and because it does n't snag on anything off the horn . I keep two in each sax case because these things are so comfortable i sometimes forget I 'm wearing the strap and do n't end up putting it in the case . The strap is not long enough for my Series II Buescher Truetone tenor or for my alto clarinet . In both cases the solution was easy -- adding a split - type key ring to the ring you normally connect the strap to .
4 #### Worked out great & was shipped promptly when I really needed it .
5 #### Had a motorola Q but upgraded to fusion 2 on Consumer Cellular and was on sale at frys for $ 39.99 but turns out its an open box frys ad did not state otherwise . The previous user did not factory reset and i found out it was only used for 3 days . This pouch is way better than the ones i have been using in the past purchase at flea market and lasted for a year . This one looks and feel durable . Update : Fits nicely with iphone 4 . I have been using this for almost 4 months and both the belt loop broke but the belt clip still in good shape and i just sew the belt loop back for added support . Thinking of buying again and reinforce the belt loop with a pants belt loop just to see if it will last longer or i 'll go back to the flea market hoping to find the one i use that lasted for a year .
5 #### This tool worked great on 98 Accord with the 3.0L V6 . It was difficult to research which size I needed , but this was the correct one ! I had to do the " starter - crank " method to break the bolt loose , as none of my impacts or breaker bars could get it . Sure they say it is dangerous to do it but heck it worked ! :-)
5 #### This pedal has spoiled me . I ca n't use anything else now ! It 's so nice to have so many options , but yet still be such a solid pedal . In my opinion it is way better than the DW pedals and Iron Cobras . You just simply ca n't get better than this . I know everyone has there own opinion and really it 's all about you trying out each one yourself to see what is right for you , but , in all seriousness that would cost a TON of money . So take my advice and get this one ! It 's great ! Also - I 've used one for over 10 years and it 's still kicking ! Get it ?
5 #### This is a fine car cover for a garaged vehicle . Keeps the dust off , good fit , easy to remove and replace . Well - priced .
5 #### clear sound . strong enough bass , not overpowering , springy - coil - cable . This is a pretty excellent headphone , continuing the line of MDRV .
5 #### Perfect . This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price . It was described correctly and arrived on time .
5 #### Great add to the camera bag and perfect for great for shooting residential interiors .
5 #### Use Elixir string on all my acoustic instruments and love them .

5 #### Good lighting clamp at an excellent price . I would purchase these again .
4 #### I thought this was a great value for a wall mount . I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit . It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought . It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket . Is it the best quality ever , no . It is decent quality , and it worked well for me .
5 #### I 'm a player of nearly 40 years . These are great picks . They are not thin like a Fender thin for example . More like a medium density . However these things fly over the strings , but they do n't seem to wear down like Tortex does . I 'm definitely sold on these picks . Whatever these are made of , Dunlop has a winner IMHO .
4 #### They work , very light weight and construction is mediocre . But if you need cheap black truck mirrors you can probably make these work
5 #### I purchased a number of Goldenrod oilers for various applications . I like them all . Well designed and constructed .
2 #### Pros : * Well - built * Works well when one is in very noisy environment * Can be charged via USB - cable provided Cons : * Hard to stay in ears * Does n't work well when one is in a noisy but not noisy - enough environment * Does n't work well under windy condition * It 's big If you ever got to check out Jawbone 's demo video on their website , you 'll see the actor showing you how well it works when you 're at super - noisy places . What he does n't show you , is when the volume in the surrounding area is , say in an office where there 're people talking around you . What does it mean ? It means the noise cancellation only works in very noisy environment . The call quality is fine when paired with a RAZR , but not so good with the HTC Touch . People would complain about the echo while paired with the Touch , so I have to take it off when they 're bothered by it . The battery lasts about 3 hours after fully charged ... good enough for me . To keep Jawbone stay in my ear , I got a spounge - like cover and just wrap it around the earpiece , and it works 70 % of the time as long as I do n't shake my head much . I would expect the Jawbone to work better at this price and got hyped up by so many users ... hopefully something better at a reasonable price will come up by the time I have to replace the Jawbone .
3 #### The covers over the clips are slick and will not stay in place when opening them .
5 #### Nice . Works well - replaced an old battery that would n't hold a charge any more ...
5 #### I have a very aggravating metal allergy to many metals especially nickel , but the ernie ball stainless strings work very well , the metal still bothers me a bit , but not nearly as much and I believe once I refret my guitars with stainless frets I 'll be completely set .
5 #### Works good , i bought this because it is recommended by the manufacturer of my replacement top on my mustang .
5 #### But these seemed to work well on the guitar I was re - stringing . My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more . Recommend .
5 #### My son used this device in SF in a uniquely dead zone for a friend . The device gave outstanding results . I used in an RV park in Colorado that had a dead zone and found it to work very well .
4 #### These work excellent and are better than having several different hitches . They do need to be lubricated and if you live in the rust belt I would NOT leave them in the receiver when not in use . If they get rusty it can be really difficult to get the ball off .
4 #### I love this thing . Bought used and was a little dirtier than I would have anticipated , but I still love it . Would highly recommend buying .
3 #### I waqs really looking forward to receiving the Motorola T35 wireless car speaker and immediatly put it to use . Set up was really easy and the speaker was able to sync with my phone with no problem . The unit was suprisenly small and compact . From the pictures I expected a larger unit . Once the unit is synced , be careful in handling it as it will immediatly want to staert dialing and calling one of you contacts . The pro side of this unit is that it lets you know when it does sync up with your phone and when you are in a dead zone . This is great if you are only driving in the city . The bad news is it constanly tells you ( every 30 secs or so ) you are in a dead zone when driving on the highway between cities . It also has the habit of unsyncing with your phone when it does this . On a long trip across the state it becomes really anoying . So much so that I have to turn it off . This defeats the purpose I got it in the first place . If I had know this I would probably not gotten it .
5 #### My favorite brand of picks . They last and are easy to hold on to .
4 #### I 've been hunting for something like this for a while . It seems rugged enough for high use and easy to install .
5 #### Very Good strings ! will buy again . Take a long time to wear out too and make my guitar sound good .
5 #### I purchased this case for my new droid and I love it . It is a snug fit and never comes loose or fall off . I have dropped it many times and it has been a life saver , not even allowing a scratch .
5 #### Good quality for money . Good to have in your problem solver bag .
2 #### Loved the length because it was for my car but it stopped working shortly after I got it . You get what you pay for .
4 #### I had scratchy ( really scratchy ) volume potentiometers on an old receiver , and I 've been trying to clean them with rubbing alcohol , which I now know can damage volume pots because it strips them of any lubrication . After using this , things are much improved , although I 'll still eventually have to replace the pots , they 're just too far gone in the upper half . I wish it had a way to keep the straw with the can when not in use : any spray product that comes with a straw should have a way to keep the can and straw together ( especially when it costs this much ) . I 've learned a lot about the longevity of rubber bands over the years .
5 #### Nice part , looks great . Not sure it will fit on all vintage LP 's , but fits on my new one perfect .
5 #### I bought one of these in 2012 when the power supply in my CISCO 24 Port unit died . I rack mounted the unit with the included ears and pluged it into my 4000 W UPS . I am using 12 active ports and have an additional 12 wired to wall jacks through my house . Its still in service .
5 #### I love elixirs . I 've tried the other brands , but keep coming back to elixirs . They are quite expensive , but worth it to me . They outlast they other brands . Long lasting , excellent feel , bright clear tone and great intonation . Worth the extra $ $ .
5 #### Easy setup . The wing nut you can adjust the tension on the cymbal and you do not have to worry about it spinning off . Nice stand for the price !
1 #### This fuse does NOT have 10AWG wire - its even marked 16AWG and looks it . You must use a Magnifying Glass to read it or at least I had to .
5 #### It 's a practical product . The throw of the faders is a bit short , but the slope and level is smooth and does n't have any problematic jumps or dead spots . So for times when you would like to ride levels with pretty fine control , you can do it , but it requires pretty careful hand positioning . I 've done it , but I 'd probably prefer a longer throw fader for that application . The connecters appear to be gold - plated and are very solid feeling . They are n't chassis mounted , so they might not be as bomb - proof as they could be , but the rig feels very solid . The combination of 1/4 " and 3.5 mm connectors is handy for my needs . Because the inputs and outputs are TRS , you can use them for stereo signals or ( perhaps ) for balanced signals . This is from the downloadable " manual " ( a one - pager ) Input Impedance : 10 K to 47 K ' Output Impedance : 2.5 K to 10 K ' Gain : -12 dB MAX Dimensions : 3.6 " x 2.7 " x 1.42 " My unit says it is made in the U.S. ( I do n't know if that is still the case ) .
5 #### Upgraded three cellphones and this allows us to charge them from our computers as well as transfer music , photos and contacts . I had cancelled an order from another vendor because it never arrived but this vendor was great
5 #### what can you say -- hosa makes great cables at a great price . this cable is well makes and is very quiet . connectors are of high quality . recommended .
3 #### I bought them last week end was quite disappointed comparing to my AKG271 and Audio Technica 40X. The high - frequency sound not clear , with sort of weird artifacts plus bass is out of balance as well . This ear cups are slightly smaller then audio Technica and AKG so they press on the edges of the ears . I would n't use of for the reference monitoring . I have done it for a long time and believe that these headphones would create issues in your mixes .
5 #### I purchased this screen protector for my droid x. It was a perfect fit and was shipped before the date estimated .
5 #### Does what it says it does . It 's well - constructed and sturdy . I was a little concerned with the string - cutter because I know I 've had issues with some in the past , but it cuts straight through the strings and does n't dent .
4 #### This cabasa is a great choice for those who are looking for good quality with low cost . However , if you want a really nice cabasa , look around at the more expensive ones . I 'm an amateur musician , and this is the first cabasa I 've purchased . It 's good , but I ca n't say that I 'm impressed . It has a comfortable handle , and the beads rotate easily around the metal . I agree with another reviewer that the metal underneath the beads does n't look like it 's very good quality . Also , the cabasa that I received is completely black . It does not have the wood - colored stain like the picture shows . For the price , this is a great deal and a lot of fun to play :)
5 #### Pretty simple - it works ! It 's a strong spring , which means it holds the strings down well , but it also takes some hand strength . I like that the peg puller adds an artistic beauty to it .
5 #### I purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while I would n't have minded keeping the extra $ $ $ , it was definitely worth it . I have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities . I am no computer expert , and this is my first ( and probably last ) digital camera . This is a great product , and Canon has done an excellent job . First off , the ease of interface with the PC was very good . I set up the camera , followed the brief instructions in the manual and had no problems setting up the camera to interface with my PC ( I 've got Windows 2000 ) . Second , the quality of the pictures is fantastic ! I have used the amazon.com site to get the pictures developed like a " real " camera , and have been very pleased with what I have gotten back . I have also used the pictures on a Ceiva Digtial Picture frame , and that has worked very well too . Third , the camera 's features are top - notch . The black and white ability , as well as the piece - meal panorama pictures ( you put them together with the included software ) are great . The ease of looking at the picture immediately after taking it lets you know when to retake and when to keep on traveling . I do recommend the larger memory card - I 've got the 48 , and it works plenty well .
5 #### Ordered for my husband 's phone , absolute perfect fit he loves it and I was tickled with the cost ... it was about half the price of what we 'd have paid at the cell phone store .
5 #### I love this screen protector.it hold up for a long time last one lasted 6 months , the only problem is that it is thick and when you go to pull off second film it does not come off stuck with little number 2 tag , so you have to separate # 2 with fingers and it sometimes gets bent ! its just a small spot on corner of screen if I would do anything it would be for co to use a stronger tab to pull off ! buy it and try it its better than the crappy iphone 4 its on ! ! p.s . bever buy apple products u have to jump through hoops to get help as att tells u that you must contact apple ! why if I buy a product I want store to fix problems ! !
4 #### I bought this product for my kids . I also bought a SanDisk 16 MB MM card . Together , they provide the ability to capture 69 640x480 images . The quality is exactly what I expected , and provides good value for the money . One concern that any prospective buyer should have is support . KBGear appears to be defunct . The website provides excellent support ( I was able to use it to locate and download the patches and drivers necessary to use the app under Win2 K ) . The question is , how long will the site remain up ? Do not expect that any rebates will be honored , or that you will have any updates other than those already on the site . Other than that , give this to your kids , let them take thousands of pictures , and print the low percentage that turn out right . P.S. taping a small rectangle of milk carton plastic over the flash really helps the color balance . Use double stick tape , and your kids wo n't notice . I also use a couple of pieces of electrical tape to cover the MMC in the slot , as there is no door to assist in retention .
4 #### These strings cost a little more but they are definitely worth it . They hold up better than any string I 've found and sound great throughout their life .
5 #### One of the best things I have bought to keep the inside of my car clean and looking new . I recommend this for everyone .
5 #### Happy with this purchase . I do n't have a laptop just an iPad and a Bluetooth keyboard and I needed to use my USB so this was necessary .
5 #### How I went for so many years towing without air bags on my pickup is beyond me . Wow , so nice to hook to my 31 foot fifth wheel and not have to worry about my headlights shining in the trees ! I drive a commercial vehicle and it is of course , equipped with air bags .... these are just like them .... but smaller . Install was a breeze and the quality is very nice . I did purchase and install the Smart Air kit with this which makes leveling automatic . I do recommend some sort of auto level with this as opposed to using just the manual filling method !
3 #### Barely a performance improvement over stock 2009 Jeep JK lights with the included 9003 bulbs . Condensation in both lights immediately after professional install from a short drive in a light rain . Next day another short drive in light rain and there is water in both lights . Installation was very fast and easy . They are a perfect fit . Pattern is okay , not as good as stock , but better than most aftermarket lights . I 'll update when replacements are installed concerning water intrusion on set # 2 . I 'm also going to see what happens when 2 100/55w H4s are used rather than the included 60/55s Edit : Returned 1st set due to water getting into both units . 2nd set arrived and I used high temp gasket maker where I thought the water was getting in . Water also got into both of these . Replaced the bulbs that came with them with Hella high wattage 100/55 and that 's an significant improvement over stock . Pulling them out again to seal every possible means of water intrusion .
5 #### Something minor , but it completed the black - out look I was going for on my Les Paul .
4 #### Arrive on time and for a great price . hard to find 90 % reflective tape for so cheap . adhesive was high quality and the tape cut smoothly . The heat resistant fabric between the adhesive back and reflective surface was a bit fibrous , so you often go them poking out the sides . This makes it difficult to lay strips next to each other to cover a sheet metal surface and to look good . Otherwise a solid product .
4 #### This is a very good phone for the money . I use the SanDisc memory card and MP3 player a lot ..... more than the phone . I would recommend it .
5 #### I use this capo all the time on both instruments . A friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also . I did and they love it !
5 #### An excellent choice for the Lumix FZ 200 camera . There 's room for a telescopic adapter and lens with the camera . The inside is well padded including the bottom . The side belt actually works . I am opting to use this feature versus the sling . Zippers and latches are top notch . The sling is well made and designed . Partitions inside the bag have velcro to make them adjustable to meet the needs of the camera . Well done !
5 #### I 've had this radio for months now and really like it . I like the digital tuning and timer function . The battery life is great . I am thinking of buying another one .
5 #### Hammond tried to sell me their expensive volume pedal for my XK ( and now SK ) keyboards . I went online and picked up this FC4 for a quarter of what it would have cost to purchase a Hammond " specific " pedal , and this one performs the same functions . Heavy duty construction , non - slip base ( for those smooth stages ) and typical Yamaha quality make this the best all around foot pedal for sustain -- and much , much more -- out there .
1 #### Did not fit aftermarket JVC head unit . Even after removing the carriage from the unit and the trim plate the opening was still over 1/4 " too small both width and height . There were no adapters or instructions to modify the kit to allow fitment .
5 #### go what I asked for in a timely manner . I ordered this and this is exactly what I got ! perfect
1 #### The wall charger does n't work ! It does not give enough power to charge the Iphone .
5 #### Great clay for car and glass cleaning . Ca n't go wrong with Meguiar 's car care products .
5 #### " Hootenanny " ! LOL ! Who uses that word ? Who knows what it is ( was ) ? Unless you 're a a baby boomer , you probably do n't know ! But nevertheless , this is one very nice strap - very well made , quality is evident in the fine stitching and workmanship . It is very impressive on my black guitar , be would be an equally good looking compliment to guitars of any color . One of my favorite guitar straps . In fact , I set it up with a Dunlop Straplok system so that I can switch it quickly to another guitar . ( Gee - for some reason , I keep getting flashbacks of Goldie Hawn on Laugh In ! ) Hootenanny ! Ha Ha ! Buy it , you 'll enjoy it !
5 #### Brand new condition . Fast shipping . this tablet is the best deal on a 9 " size that you can get . Way better than what the same size cost in my last husband . Easy to use , lots of storage for apps even the large ones . PLUS will hold additional scancard . Beats the Kindle ( sorry Amazon ) by a mile in functionality , weight and price .
4 #### Fit perfectly on my little window mount piece . It 's just a little bit too small for my cargo van . Probably better for a smaller car / truck . Great for the price .
4 #### Works great , just peels crome to easy . Still like it
5 #### VERY HAPPY WITH THIS MIC . COMES IN A NICE CASE AND VERY EASY TO USE . GOOD BUY .
1 #### ang and a half to 2 inches length Mall of millenia record not worth it
5 #### Does what it was designed for and looks good doing it .
2 #### i generally do n't suck at putting screen protectors on , but idk what was up with this one . i had 2 bubbles , did n't like it , then my greedy self tried again and tried other " tips " , then rage quitted and got at least 20 mini bubbles . ugh . aside from the bubbles , i like how clear it is , but i feel like i 'm better off not using the screen protector at all . :/ i just got it today , so maybe my opinion will change over the next few weeks / months . next time , i m ordering a cheap one that gives me multiple chances to screw up ... a 3 or 6 pack . yeahh
5 #### It is good to have this when you do n't want to use your iPod or iPhone for justice and save your car battery . Just reach out and touch your music and play it . Thanks
5 #### I purchased my " Absorber " in 1998 , and have used it several hundreds of times over the 15 years or so . I 've also washed it about a dozen times in the washing machine with washing detergent , but definitely would n't think putting it in a dryer is a very good idea . Mostly because , you want it to stay moist / wet , always . Works as good as when I first purchased it , and the condition of the skin has not changed . Remarkable material . Mimicks a real chamois in feel and absorbency . Ca n't imagine another product of this type being better . Just squeeze out the water , roll it back up , and put it in the original plastic container . Mine has never mildewed or gotten mold on it . I bought the green or aqua color . Highly recommend .
4 #### A bit looser in consistency than I was expecting , but easy to apply . Adequate adhesion . Easy clean up , which is good since it does run a little .
5 #### If you take still photos - you NEED this photography staple ! Super light weight , easy to use and is a very handy and helpful tool . A retractable longer cord would be nice but all in all its pretty perfect .
5 #### Bought for dirt bike number plate next to exhaust . Stuck to it pretty good after I cleaned it . well see if it stays on after a while .
5 #### This is simply the best sounding headphones for under $ 100 . The bass is incredible , the sound is crispy clear . When I commute in the train , I can hardly hear any noise , and the comfort is great .
2 #### Upon receiving this charger I though it would prove to be quality product . Unfortunately not the case . I have had this charger for a year . All of the labeling has come off the unit . The lableling is barley better than a soup can . The worst thing is that both of the clamps broke at different times . Called Vector and they said to send the unit back to them . I asked if i could just send the broken clamp back for a new one , the girl on the phone said no . If I changed them myself it would void the warrenty . Bogus ! Pay $ 15.00 to send the unit back for a broken clamp . Very poor customer care policies on such an expensive charger . The charger is still charging but would not spend the additional $ $ $ it costs for this unit . There are many other 3 stage chargers that would perform equally or better . I have yet to get the 100 amp quick start to work . Hope this is helpful
4 #### Swapped these out for my Phillips " hid attitude " bulbs . No difference in brightness , but the color difference is unreal . I have large headlight housing the color of the bulb reflects a cool blue hue . Will purchase again .......... and a SN stay away from nokya .
5 #### This is a really great tool to have around the shop . It worked great on my a / c system but I can see where you could use this to clean fuel lines , brake lines , transmission lines , etc . I would have liked another smaller rubber tip for smaller lines but it really works well overall .
1 #### Stiff leather and hard uncomfortable trap . I gave up putting strap locks on these and bough another brand strap .
1 #### So i know people reported that this indicated 50 - 60 degrees hotter than it should . I know my engine is not overheating because i used my laser thermometer and measure the temp at the thermostat and it was at 145 ( normal ) however the gauge was indicating around 190 or so . I replaced my temperature sender on my 5.7L Mercruiser and i had the same issue . However i noticed that i my gauge was a Teleflex ( original ) so it made sense that the sender and gauge did n't seem to be talking the same language .. My mechanic said that making sure you have the right sender that s matched up to the right gauge is important for temp accuracy . I purchased the Sierra Water Temp gauge that should go with this sender ( from Amazon ) and will swap it out this weekend and see if i see it solve the issue . * * Update apparently a resistor can be added to the sender wire to lower the temp indicated if it 's wrong * * . What a pain ! ! ! Next time I 'm buying original Mercury parts !
5 #### Looks good and fits my fuse block . The fuse looks solid in the center but 250 amps is alot as long as it blows if needed it 's great . Hopefully that is never needed .
5 #### Well made cable that I am using to extend my web cam 's distance from my cpu so I can have a wider view of the room .
1 #### The cases sent ARE NOT AS PICTURED ... seller is substituting case ASIN : B004IP2QB4 for case ASIN : B001CMG26 G without advising or asking buyers who order ASIN : B001CMG26 G if the substitution is OK in advance . The belt loops snap on and will unsnap easily instead of the sewn on loops pictured . The case is low quality and will not be long lived . The case is n't worth the low price we pay for it and not worth betting the safety of a big buck phone on . Consider the seller carefully before ordering ...
5 #### I have had these things for years . Ca nt beat the quality for the price . Still running strong . Only thing I have had to do is replace the ear covers which are cheap
5 #### PROS : Thick and I mean thick ! Using for a Intermec 5200 scanning device for work which you ca n't get a ZAGG for Holds up to signatures , constantly checking boxes with a 9 mm lead pencil The measurement lines for use in sizing to your specific needs are outstanding . PACK of ten for $ nothing in my opinion ! ! ! CONS : NONE
2 #### I got this to use with a Linux based XBMC media center on a ZBOX as the DVD player . It was recognized out of the box . It plays DVDs great , until it just quits . I 'll have to buy another drive as this one is not working for me .
4 #### Have abunch of these for hanging instruments on the wall . Look good , great support , no scratches on the necks .
5 #### Can not believe how easy it was to use . I needed to change the oil in my two Honda Jetski 's and this did the trick ! Very easy to use and worked like a charm ! Excellent pressure to remove the oil quickly . Very happy customer !
4 #### Overall its great . Works as advertised , my only annoyance is when you turn the radio off it disconnects from your phone . FYI The microphone needs to be mounted on the ceiling , otherwise the microphone will not pick your voice up .
4 #### Compact and light . This is a great product for field use . I use this when hiking to focus in on items of interest . For the price you ca n't beat this deal .
5 #### This is a replacement for an Absorber I owned for several years which I lost . It works as advertised and will not scratch the paint as long as it is used correctly . Do not use it dry . Wet first and then wring it out .
5 #### Perfect for my needs ... just the length I wanted , and half the price of the same thing I found at an electronics store in our mall .
5 #### Christmas gift for someone very special . I gave one and they work fantastic .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for . I needed a catch all tote for work that I could keep all my Nursing supplies in . It 's handy as a Go Bag for around the house too in an emergency . I just love knowing all my medical equipment is in one place if I ever needed it in an emergency . I wish it had an inside zip pocket for valuables , but other than that it 's perfect .
5 #### Not only is this little light good for reading or music stands , but it 's great for searching for things in narrow spaces . You can bend it to the configuration you need . You can probably put something sticky on the end to grab onto whatever slipped down into that narrow space .
4 #### The last car charger I had stopped working after a few weeks . This one has lasted a few months so far and I 'm hoping I wo n't have to replace it any time soon ! The only thing I do n't like is that the snaps on the plug are kinda weak , and the plug does n't always stay in the phone .
5 #### UPDATE(12/17/14 ): Still use these to this day . UPDATE(09/09/13 ): Still working but do n't use as much because somebody gave me better headphones . But , these work fine . 03 - 10 - 13 These stereo headphones for the price are really great ! I thought they could have been a little louder but this might not be a headphones issue . They are mostly made of plastic ( except for the wires and electronics of course ) and are adjustable . I 'm not sure how long they will last ( I have read about other people having these for many years ) . They can be used for the personal pocket talkers , however , this was n't the intended use ( other headphones are actually louder ) . Just be aware that pocket talkers can be mono so you still only get sound on one side even though the headphones are stereo . This can be fixed by plugging in a mono to stereo adapter into your pocket talker and then plugging these headphones into the adapter . PROS : Price , model has been around for many years ( something must be going right ) , lightweight , good bass sound for such a small thing , known brand CONS : Basically none , but they could be a little louder ( this could be my device or my ears ) OTHER : No volume control on the cord like some other headphones have but I knew this before buying
3 #### A perfect good Ethernet switch but I did n't see the it is only 10/100 Mbps . So it is the bottleneck in my network . I now use it as an extra switch if I need additional temporary connections . It states " Every port supports up to 200 Mbps in dedicated bandwidth " but I could verify this . Pros : - Very reliable - Small footprint Cons : - Only for 10/100 Mbps networks - No indicator light on front ( non cable side since this is not rack mounted ) - Rubber feet tend to fall off
5 #### Works as expected with iPhone . It 's small , so I may close cover in the car to have it not visible .
5 #### I used this yesterday changing oil on 2 cars . It was very intuitive to set up and shove down the dipstick tube . I noticed I had to play with the hose a couple times while sucking the oil , but it was able to get all the oil out of both my mom 's mustang and my sister 's sonic . I no longer have to get under the car to change oil ! I hope to use this for years to come !
4 #### I 'm not going to review the screen protector , because I did n't use it . The case , though , is excellent . It 's not too bulky and fits my 3GS like a second skin . It just barely wraps around the front edge of the phone , so it does n't get in the way at all when using the touch screen . I love the see - through aspect of it and wish I 'd chosen an iPhone with a white back instead of black now ! The silicone material provides a bit of grip without making it difficult to slide into a pocket . My only nitpick ( and it 's a tiny one ) is the " seam " along the edge of the case , where the two halves of the mold apparently came together . This is just a quibble though ; the case is excellent and I 'd buy another in a heartbeat .
5 #### I purchased these screws with the intention of using them to screw down the back of my laptop . I learned that these are not the correct screws for that so I reordered the correct screws .
1 #### The slot for the radio was to small and radio did n't sit right . I tried to exchange it but no one will listen .
5 #### I love these Dunlop capos . They are quick to put on , grip nicely , and above all they do n't get in the way of your hand . I bought 5 of them from Amazon because they were such a good price .
5 #### This is pretty easy to setup ... if you actually read the instructions . It 's important to charge it first ... duh . Make sure when you plug in the connector it goes all the way and charges for at least two hours . The setup it really easy after that . Calls are loud and clear ... I wear hearing aids and this really helps !
5 #### This product was excellent ! The guy who had a bad review probably installed it wrong or accidentally damaged a part during the process . I was very delicate and took my time installing the new screen step by step from the YouTube clip ( they give you a link to it on your receipt ) . As long as you connect everything properly after replacing the glass , your phone will be as good as new . My friends have paid $ 65-$200 for someone else to do the same job that costs less than $ 15 with this kit . I was going to buy a new phone after my screen cracked but luckily I did some research and found this kit . Works wonders !
4 #### I put it on the boom of my mic stand . Tight on some , not on others . I need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place .
5 #### made the installation of an aftermarket head unit a breeze in my 2001 Accord . Literally just plug and play if you know what you 're doing . The pocket is kind of shallow , but it 's subjective .
2 #### I bought this when I switched from AT&T to T - mobile . TM 's signal is much weaker and does n't penetrate my apartment like ATT 's does in downtown San Francisco . The signal is OK pretty much everywhere else so I got this booster for home . Does it work ? Probably , if you are willing to drill a hole in your wall , run the cable to the roof , have a spare outlet and are willing to put up with the extra electricity charge and equipment necessary . My landlord will not let me drill or install the cable . I tried putting it in a couple of windows and it did n't improve the signal at all ; apparently not high enough .
4 #### Both of them were damaged at the top right . there was a dent . so i ca n't really use it right now . I am screenprotector - less . i would like to review another review unit .
4 #### I have now had this phone for a week . I have had no problems with it at all . It has all the features i could want in a cell phone / pda . I have downloaded the Opera browser because Internet explorer does nt let you have more than 1 window open at a time . The ringer on the phone is amazingly loud . Plus I just put a song from my pc as the ring tone . The clarity of the calls is amazing . That was a key concern when I was looking at the phone . I just thought they might concentrate more on the pocket pc part of the phone , than the actual phone itself . One reason I love this phone is it is quad - band . I had the SidekickII but it was only tri - band and did n't work in Maine where my parents live . This one works everywhere . The keyboard takes some adjusting , but it 's usable once you get used to it.overall this is a great phone .
5 #### A little tricky at first cuz da instructions dat comes with it sucks but commonsence is all datz need looks good & sturdy ..
5 #### Got this for elder neighbor lady friend . It 's a favorite with elders , what they used years ago and not locally available . She was tickled to get it .
5 #### great light . Puts out a very bright white light . Like other reviewers I had to adjust them a bit . They were just a bit higher than my old ones so had to adjust them down just a bit .
5 #### Great Product ! I would not have had to buy it for a couple years ( or more ) had I read the instructions on the K & N filter I had just purchased . I installed new K & N Filter , took a road trip to Oregon ( from Cali ) and decided to wash the filter after returning from road trip ( hit a lot of dusty areas ) . So , I decided to wash the filter , which was not very dirty and re - installed . Then I read further and found that you wash their filters ( cold air intake- they do make cabin filter also ) After 50 Thousand Miles . Once you wash , it is then good to spray the filter with their oil , which is instrumental in trapping some particles , and re - install . So , I washed out the oils from a perfectly good filter way to early . That is why I bought the can to re - insert the oils .
5 #### I guess the true test is when your friends who are pro or semi - pro musicians steal them . Jeopardize a friendship over a cable ? Happened twice already ...
5 #### Ford brand filter .. This is the one to use duh ... And only 10 $ ...
5 #### Fit very well and do n't leave streaks . A bit light - duty but they exceed expectations for the price .
5 #### Love these small speakers . Very handy but could be more powerful .
2 #### I got this a couple of months ago . One thing I did notice was that if you do n't use the screen protector that comes with the case . there is a good chance that the case itself will push up against the bottom of your protector . This will cause a bubble that ca n't be pressed down since the case is in the way . A few weeks ago the thin piece of plastic at the very bottom cracked . Just today I found out that there was another crack on the circle part of the case on the back that holds the 2 pieces together . I just found it ridiculous that this case got such good reviews initially , so I decided to write this to help even things out . It 's good at first glance even in person , but after a few short months you 'll probably end up needing another case .
3 #### It worked well to hide the bolt on a spare tire .
4 #### My last Heath / Zenith sensor on newly installed light lasted about 2 years . I thought I would have to buy the whole unit , but glad they sell just the sensor . Box said it needs to be hooked up to a light switch , but I did n't . I do n't understand why that was needed . The original sensor came with a green ground wire ... this sensor does not . Not sure how that will affect anything since the fixture itself is grounded to the electrical system anyway . This sensor turns the light on Full bright RIGHT NOW . My original sensor ramped up the light over a second or two . No directions , so just pay attention ... white to white , black to black and red to red . Pretty strait forward .
5 #### As a journalist , I needed a bag that was durable , lightweight , and most importantly , could carry all my stuff around on my multiple cross country trips . The fact that the Saddlebag was so cheap was a definite bonus . I 'm tremendously impressed by how well it displaces the weight on your shoulder so that you do n't get fatigued , and the compartments inside are huge and really well padded . Unless you have $ 300-$400 to spend on a laptop case , I 'd go with the Saddlebag over anything else .
5 #### i bought this to make sure i had a pic on me while i m playing instead of looking for one ..... i put it on my guitar strap and it stays ! ! ! i thought it would fall off by ow but it has survived and i barely drop a pick but if i do i just slip down pick up another one it holds about ten picks its cheap design ..... but good for the price i payed ... it wo n't fall apart and i need nothing fancy it serves its purpose
5 #### Being that cellular Bluetooth is so common - I do n't understand why home bluetooth phones are so hard to come by - but thank goodness Plantronics came up with a good one . I highly recommend this product to anyone who works from home , as I do . And the customer service is pretty good too ; I thought my headset went bad ( turned out to be an easily fixed connection issue ) , but they were ready to ship me out a new unit right away .
5 #### The instructions are easy enough to follow , but I still found myself looking for a YouTube video to help show me how much I should be applying to the filter . I love the K&N filters that you can clean them and they are high quality . This kit is not very pricey at all and it 's smart to use the manufacturer recommended and produced products to achieve optimum performance . Again , I would recommend watching a video if you can find one to help apply this product .
1 #### I bought the ebookman to use as a PDA and for easy access to the Physician Desk REference . Even when not in use the product goes thru batteries faster than I can recharge them . I have had it replaced once and still can not replace the batteries without losing all the data . I certainly would not but another one .
5 #### I bought this because I can afford the Gibson version and I am impressed . It sounds wonderful and it loud enough for practicing or playing to a few people without being amplified . If feels really nice to play and is my main guitar now after about seven years of playing with a strat . It has a thicker neck then Fender style guitars but the neck " cups " in my hand very comfortably . I love this guitar .
5 #### This cable rocks . It fits in nice and tight in both my Blackberry Curve and my Toyota Corrola 's AUX input . Sound quality is fantastic . It 's very clean sounding with no static or noise . I would recommend it to anyone .
5 #### Good deal . I need to get a device to carry my phone on an armband ( when it is n't in my backpack ) , but when I 'm somewhere that I can set my Xperia down , these work almost anywhere within 30 feet . Plenty of volume , lots of bass , I was really surprised with the amount and quality of sound . I had the over - the - ear predecessors to these ( HT-820),and they lasted for almost 6 years , so I expect these will last .
4 #### The best thing about this is that it stopped ' vapor lock ' that my ' 56 Thunderbird would get . This occurred if I turned engine off after driving in a parade . I doubled up on the installation where line went by air conditioner 's compressor . The only weakness is that the glue that was used did not stick well to the oxidized fuel line . This is also a positive thing in that it would be easy to remove . I used wire ties to insure that it did not un - wrap .
5 #### I primarily play bass with my fingers but for the times that the song just calls for using a pick , this is the one !
2 #### This card embarrassed me . I recommended it to a friend with a Gigabyte mb , and it crashed the machine repeatedly . An obsolete NeXXt card delivered the goods . I was puzzled , as I had used it successfully on an IBM mb and an ASUS mb :(
4 #### Thought there would be a cutout handle , there is none . However , emits a great sound .
4 #### Great for the value . Fits the captivate perfect and love all the colors . It slips on easy and makes the phone easy to grip .
5 #### Nice long cord . Doing it 's job well in a room with older wiring . Multiple devices used simultaneously with no probs .
5 #### Take your time lining things up properly as that 's 3/4 of the trick installing these . High quality and functional , they add a sporty look to any Jeep Liberty . AVS is the way to go . Avoid imitations .
4 #### Very handy item to use when getting my lessons for learning to play the bagpipes . Very portable and easy to use . Saves on the neck too !
5 #### Great color and price . This was an inexpensive case and easy to order . I am pleased with my decision to order .
3 #### May work well but sets to slow for the job we were working on , slow to set and lets item move even with very little item weight .
5 #### This is my third ( 3rd ) Motorola H720 , the other two was stolen or lost . I tried others , but this is the Best one I have had since I had a cell 15 years ago & it did n't cost $ 100 dollars . I do n't get any complaints when using the headset .
5 #### There is nothing unique about the cable . Quality seems to be good .
5 #### Covers almost everything required regarding regular maintenance and rebuilding using conventional home mechanic tools . Plenty of useful tips . Highly recommended .
5 #### I put this on my 1979 camaro and it looks as sweet as it sounds and drives gon na put a set on my truck also
5 #### great product as always .. new heads are a must for a drummer jamming frequently .. get yourself a new drum head today these sound great .
5 #### Nice product for my Olympus recorder . Holds it snugly , so no slipping out . My microphones can easily pick up conversations while resting inside its ' protective home .
5 #### Fits the tire just as it should . Good heavy fabric and it looks nice . Will buy again in the future .
4 #### Rico Mitchell Lurie reeds are not the Mitchell Lurie of old . It 's like cooking with your Mother 's recipe . It 's good but it still does n't quite reach the mark . However , they are still the best reed out there to me . Speaks well , warm and well rounded . Not top heavy or top soft . Lasts me about three weeks , playin ' four days a week for about seven hours a day .
5 #### My 2000 pc was some how got fried and I needed to only replace the network card . This was a great solution . Good value and easy install .
5 #### These should be standard with the feet - totally necessary to keep your rack from getting lifted .
4 #### this is a good little clamp that does the job but it will tear your truss apart if your not careful . i place a rubber band between the clamp and the bar to prevent severe damages , but otherwise , gets the job done .
2 #### I was really disappointed this did n't work better . This was a Christmas gift for my husband . We used it twice on long road trips . We did have a signal the whole trip , BUT our phone kept falling out of the cradle . The phone got really hot and 1 of the cords that you screw into the cradle kept coming undone . We had to keep connecting it . Returned it .
5 #### I did a little research to find the best strings and other reviews aimed me at these . I just got done stringing them and they sound great . I think these will be what I play from now on .
3 #### Great for six months then fades . Buy the metal one if you plan on keeping it on a lot
5 #### Neat little lock . On and seems to be fine , I did bent the backplate slightly to tighten up the shackle slop , but it works as advertised
5 #### I have an older vehicle and wanted to stream radio stations from my phone to the car stero . I tried the wireless transmitter and there was too much interference . This unit has some slight background hiss but I use it everyday and I 'm very happy with the way it functions . It will connect to phones and MP3 players .
5 #### Good quality cord for the price . I got this one for my daughter who plays sitting down , and the sturdier one for my son who runs around like a Rock Star . There is no feedback or interference from this cord , which is importand for sound quality . We 've only had it for a month , but it 's held up great so far .
5 #### for the price this is really cool , you will need to buy extra memory , but it works with free mp3 players to load . the headphones are ear type so get a real pair , otherwise this worked great
3 #### It works , I wish I could give more comment , but they are the same as every other screen protector I have used . Nothing unique about these , but hte price was decent , but not the best .
5 #### Used it once on my leather couches and chair , the leather feels soft and shinny now , just like we I first bought them a year ago .
4 #### My thing about buying a smart phone was having to carry such a large phone around all the time . I 'm a 63 year old male and did n't want to walk around with a phone in my hand all the time like I see so many young people doing . This is just slightly larger than my standard cell phone holder , and since it is horizonal on my belt it rides just fine . Good quality . I have a iphone 4s with a protective case and it fits just fine . It would probable be a little large if it did n't have the protective case on it . I would highly recommend .
4 #### it is a fuel filter , what more can I say
3 #### It does n't draw as fast as my other cords , but it works .
5 #### With the standard 18 - 55 mm ( non - VR ) kit lens + filter my Nikon D40 fits snugly inside . The construction is what you 'd expect from LowePro , bulletproof and well - padded . With minor effort , the charger fits in the outer pocket . This case works well either over - the - shoulder or on a belt or backpack loop . Note : If the lens was more than 1/2 " longer this case probably would n't work .
5 #### Best Blackberry item there is .... Makes charging you Blackberry 9700 a dream . Mine is on my desk and is used daily !
5 #### Excellent - have had a set of these front and back on our F350 for over ten years . A high - speed blow - out took out one rear flap , the mud guard was a loss but but we believe that actually reduced the level of fender damage we sustained . We bent the fender edges back in place with some wide jawed specialty metal pliers and ordered a replacement set . Same great Husky look and quality fit after ~10 years , even the same mold / product codes ..
5 #### When it comes to camera bags Tamrac sets the standard for all others in my opinion . This bag is made of top quality materal and llike my other Tamrac bag I know it will last longer than I will be here . Very thoughjtful storage for two of your Nikon forrmat digital SLR 's and the sister lens , Lots of cool storage areas for all the extras we photofreaks need . You get what you pay for and this is no exception , not the least expensive bag but the best for sure .
5 #### it is a nice rubber case that fits snugly around my nexus . I like it and it will protect it from small drops and bumps . I would by no means expect it to protect it from a full fledged fall or smash against concrete . good for me I do n't plan on throwing it or dropping it from any heights I just seem to have little slips and this is good for that . I am happy with the product
2 #### I was attracted to the small size , and my respect for the Panasonic brand , I purchased this to take to Rose Bowl football games . But for that purpose it suffers from a lack of clarity and weak AM reception .
5 #### Hey for a little over a $ 1 , ca n't beat that . Does what it 's supposed to do , so I got what I paid for .
5 #### Outstanding tone , nice variations depending on where you strike it , very full sound and projects quite nicely . It mounted easily on my rack system and has lasted a few gigs so far . As I 've only had this for a month or so , and only played a few gigs - I will update my review if anything notable happens . Meanwhile , this cowbell is quite tasty .
3 #### The product is nice but it does n't fit very well around the edges at the front of the phone . for the price is very good and protects you phone very well , i just did n't like the fact that i had to remove it and clean up the phone every 2 days .
5 #### I had the version of this windshield cover which had the roll down flaps . I did not like it . I sold that one and switched to the single piece cover . I like it much better . No problems with the wind blowing the flap down like the old one and you do n't have to worry about someone walking by and pulling the flap down to have a look at what s inside . Much better and more simple .
3 #### One the drawbacks to direct injection engines these days is that they can be the victims of severe carbon build up in the intake valves , seafom or any other chemical for example wo n't be able to clean the carbon behind the valves , this will have to be cleaned by a professional , I found that doing a good old Italian tune up on my FJ every few months does much better at cleaning out all the crud , , , generally right before the oil change is best .
3 #### The items are a good buy and very useful and convenient to have . The USB cable is a bit loose and pulls out easily .
5 #### After 20 plus years of playing I 've tried every brand and every gimmick of guitar string out there . The coated Nanowebs & Clear Tones , the different alloy formulas like the cobalts and platinums and the mix & match heavy top / light bottoms . To me nickel wound or straight nickel strings are the best for electrics , but for Strats in particular the Fender Bullets are my favorites . The marketing device of the bullet ends making the strings sustain more with the trem block is true . I can hear the difference on my main Strat from using like Ernie Balls & D'addario 's to the Bullets . Their not necessarily brighter , just more defined with better sustain . If you have a Gibson Les Paul or an ES style electric then the bullet ends may not make the big difference they would in a Strat or strung through body Telecaster . If you do have a Fender Strat or Tele , try them at least once to see if the difference suits your style & sound .
2 #### Love the design , while it lasted . Started fading after a few weeks
2 #### i bought these as a replacement for the screen protector i purchased when i got the phone . my old one had been beaten up and had a few nicks in it ( after a year and a half ) . i put one of these on a few months back and it 's already pretty beat up . it works but is n't great quality . i would recommend getting some at at&t or sprint for a few more bucks . if you do n't mind changing the cover ever few months , these are a good cheap option .
4 #### This was exactly what was advertised , thank you . I would recommend this item to any one who needs one like it .
5 #### Love it . Will buy more when I run out . Worth every penny . Lasts a long time . Saves having to find a mirror - like when checking teeth after a meal :)
1 #### Wrong connectors . These are male and should be female . For some reason they are n't returnable .
5 #### I use this to extend the receiver of a wireless presentation remote . Works great and by a reputable company . It replaced one that I purchased online that stopped working when I dropped it out of a window accidentally . ( Ironically , the wireless receiver did n't break when it hit the floor , just the USB extender - so I bought this to replace it . )
5 #### THESE STRINGS MAKE PLAYING THE MANDOLIN A LOT EASIER . WORTH THE MONEY TO BUY .
5 #### Works great in my entertainment center . Have a lot of devices these days that connect to the internet , and decided to cut down on the wifi in the house . This guy works great with all the devices , no hassle , easy install .
4 #### No reason for fewer than 4 stars , but the test of time will tell whether it deserves 5 or not ...
1 #### This will only fit a standard wired microphone ( SM-58 or others ) . My wireless mics ( which is what I bought it for ) are too long , and the holes are too small . I would take the foam out and modify it to my needs , but it is glued and sewn into the bag . I 'm not sure what I 'll do with the bag , but it wo n't be holding any microphones unfortunately .
5 #### I love this Product ! Arrived quickly . Will order again ! Thx seller !
4 #### Does exactly what it 's advertised for . Super - heavy duty power wire that is generously long . The plug hugs the wall so you can hide it behind the furniture . I do n't know the reason for the color coding of the sockets , but I do n't really care because once you plug in the equipment plugs , the colors are hidden anyway . Very reasonably priced and appears to be of good quality . I would buy it again .
5 #### Awesome HDMI cable , this cable works great ! Picture & sound quality is great ! !
4 #### Very nice price . Would have given it five stars but I want to see how well it last . I have a Iphone 3 with a Magpul cover and the phone fits with no problems .
4 #### I disagree with the other review posted . These screen protectors fit my Palm Pre well and have prevented many scratches . It took a moment to get everything lined up , but even when used with my hard case , they protect all of the exposed areas that the case does not .
3 #### Little small and cheap feeling but it does the job nevertheless . For the price it 's ok and helps if you do n't want fingerprints all the time .
5 #### I have purchased 8 of these now . A few for me and some for friends . I put my large Dell Venue Pro Windows phone in it and it holds it securely no matter what I do . The sideways orientation is great because I can sit and stand and crouch and it never matters . Getting into and out of the car was always an issue with clip - on holders because they would catch . Not this one . It stays tight whether clipped to my belt or with my belt looped through it . I use it outside , when gardening , when running - everywhere . The elements do n't bother the case at all and the phone stays dry . The top flap closes well with a slight magnetic catch and it does not pop open , ever , but is easily lifted . I put a smaller flip - phone into it and it works just as great . I alaso put a Blackberry Pearl into it , same thing . If you want simple , long - lasting and inexpensive - buy this .
5 #### I got these to add more sounds to the set . I am pleased withr the results . Be aware that there are two other kinds of rods , which make a louder sound and are specifically for bigger venues ( large halls , arenas , etc ) . If you play in a small room or small church , this will do .
5 #### They work great , for what I would like to record . Do not buy the 9 or 8 hour Maxwell video tapes . Thought I would also save time recording and having more tape to record on . But they ended up being more scratchy , and distorted . It seem like the tapes were used , or ruined some how . Then repackage and sold like new . It not worth spending the money to get the 9 or 8 hour Maxwell tapes . Stick with TDK 6 hour tapes , when recording . Well worth the money here .
4 #### you need an Velcro sticker on the bottom of the clutter catcher or it will not stay in place if you have a rear wheel car , It 's for a front wheeled drive vehicle one that does n't have a hump .
2 #### It was awkward for me to use it it was just too much stuff hanging Ophiait would work if you 're used to a headset
5 #### This is great stuff - just a little dab will do you ! You can use this on your pick and once it sets up you do n't have to worry about dropping your pick - it will stick to your finger just fine so you wo n't miss a beat ! A little container will last you a long while !
4 #### Very easy to use on and off violin rest . Came with directions , however , seemed to be missing a few parts ? Fits easily on back of violin and does n't fall off while playing . Padding is very comfortable , and the legs of the shoulder rest adjust for height distance between shoulder and chin . Very well made . Only draw back is that it does not swivel back and forth for shoulder adjustment . Overall I give it an " A "
5 #### cleaned air filter no more stalling because of dirty filter
5 #### And it 's still going . So it does n't have bells and whistles ( auto sensing , auto shutoff , etc ) . I 've been using this thing for years and it still serves me well .
4 #### I ordered this item because I have poor signal for my Sprint phone ( HTC Evo ) in my apartment . At best I had 2 tiny bars . After I installed this item it boosted up to 4 and sometimes 5 bars . This item has worked better than I expected since I paid less than 3 bucks for it . I am extremely satisfied with this and would recommend it to anyone with signal issues .
5 #### Had a motorola Q but upgraded to fusion 2 on Consumer Cellular and was on sale at frys for $ 39.99 but turns out its an open box frys ad did not state otherwise . The previous user did not factory reset and i found out it was only used for 3 days . This pouch is way better than the ones i have been using in the past purchase at flea market and lasted for a year . This one looks and feel durable . Update : Fits nicely with iphone 4 . I have been using this for almost 4 months and both the belt loop broke but the belt clip still in good shape and i just sew the belt loop back for added support . Thinking of buying again and reinforce the belt loop with a pants belt loop just to see if it will last longer or i 'll go back to the flea market hoping to find the one i use that lasted for a year .
5 #### come fast , went on easy and it was cheaper online then in stores ... i do most my shopping online .. recomend this product to everyone .. keep your window cracked open a little on hot days and when it rains ...
4 #### This product works as advertised . It is very sturdy , looks good and seems to protect my phone . That s what truly matters so I am good with it .
4 #### These have changed my life . I was going to plummet off my outdoor stairway , when I found these . The black color clashes with the white of the garden lattice that I lashed to the railing , but they do the job quite admirably . Nothing could be better ( except white ones , but these will not dissolve in the sun ) .
5 #### I bought this bag for a new Canon EOS Rebel T2i ( 18 - 55 lens kit ) that I bought in the same order . It fits perfectly . I do n't have any additional lenses , so I store the battery charger in the bag as well . I really like the rugged material , and all the buckles seem solid and well constructed . This is a bag built to last . Good padding for the camera . The bag fits the camera plus one other lens , the EF 50 mm f/1.4 lens . * update 8/8/2013 * I bought a new Canon EOS Rebel T3i with the 18 - 135 kit lens , plus the EW-73B lens hood , plus the EP - EX15 II eyepiece extender . No problem - the camera , with all attachments , fits in the bag . However , I also just got the BG - E8 battery grip , and the camera with battery grip attached does n't fit in the bag unless I remove the lens hood . I 'm returning the bag now , and ordering a bigger bag , probably the 200DG or the 300DG .
5 #### Good cord , works wonderfully and is easy to secure with the sticky cable ties .
4 #### The welds certainly do look a little sloppy , but hopefully they 'll hold up well . The double locking feature is a great thing to have !
5 #### I have always loved the tone , and feel of these strings ... depending on the gauge will determine the longevity as like most others ... these have always just felt right for my fingers ... maybe just a psychological thing , but hey , whatever works right ? As mentioned in the subject , they are my favorite , I have been a long time customer ... personal preferences , like personal opinions ...
5 #### I almost did n't buy this camera , due to the bad reviews . My first camera choice was USB only , and I needed a serial connection . So , with great trepidation , I bought the Jamcam3 . Initially , I was extremely disappointed . The first images you see are in the " JamCam photo shop viewer " . Do n't give up here ! I think some people have seen these blurry blobs of grey and assumed this was the image they were stuck with . Not so . Be sure to " Download Picture " to thumbnail form . Also , I had to change my screen settings to 640x480 to see the controls properly . I might also mention my PC ( 586 - 133 ) is below the recommended minimum and I 'm making out ok . The pictures are not bad . I am satisfied . Remember , this is a 640x480 camera , so do n't expect too much . The flash is good for dark areas . One final item ... I heard batttery life was short , according to some reviews , so I use my camera with a 9 volt adapter plugged into the wall .
4 #### There is nothing outstanding about this cable . It works fine , but still it is just a cable . I would expect it to work .
5 #### This is a great sounding mic for live performance , especially for the price . You can spend a bunch more for a live mic but I do n't really now how much you 'll really get out it unless you 're Mariah Carey . I have several other shire microphones ( beta 58a , pg48 , etc ) and this one blows them away . It almost sounds as good as my large diaphragm studio mic .
4 #### The case is not white , its more of a silver . It 's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly . It took too long to arrive .
1 #### This is a horrible piece of crap . waste of money .
3 #### I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy . I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago , and I do n't recall having this issue , so I 'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point . I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle , and the locks are secure . However , due to this issue , I 'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks . I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon .
5 #### Immediately started loading the card with various data - found the card to be fast and solid . The card works flawlessly in my Samsung tablet
5 #### Great build quality , works like it should . Feels comfortable to wear also . No complaints at all :) Great color also considering my guitar is a shade of green :D
5 #### I have this mounted in the back cabin of my boat . It 's easy to press the button to light it up , and it 's plenty bright for viewing the time but not so bright that it 's annoying at night . Working perfectly for what I wanted . Numbers are large and clear .
5 #### These are good batteries . It will work in my scooter and PWC . I was buying a new Walmart battery ever year for the watercraft . I think this battery will even work in an ATV . Not sure how long it will last but so far so good .
4 #### My mother has been hunting all over the place for a small battery operated radio . I finally found this one on amazon . It works pretty good . Decent sound for its size . The fm is better than the am . but as it is with most radios . Nothing fancy about it . which is just what my mother is looking for . This is a good buy not sure why it is being dicontinued other than the fact most people use other sources for music . I would buy this again .
5 #### I must say these are high qaulity covers ... make shure you size you steering wheel . They can be stretched a.bit buy throwing it in the drier for a minute .
5 #### This was just as describe . Will buy again if needed . 5 star rating . Received in a timely fashion and exactly what I needed . Highly recommend ! !
5 #### quality ! this should cost double ! really nice , heavy - duty piece of hardware !
5 #### After making some recent upgrades in my primary audio / video system it became clear that the two way splitter that the cable company provided was simply inadequate to the task . Upon doing some research I determined that this particular splitter made by one of the industries most reputable manufacturers was going to have to be the way to go . Upon hooking up this superior two - way splitter in conjunction with Monster 's MV3F2 M NF Video 3 coaxial cables there was quite a wonderfully distinct difference in the picture on my new television . After seeing such a distinct improvement in the signal for my primary audio / video system I immediately went out and purchased another one for the computer room to use for both the cable modem and the television in that room . This is the perfect two - way splitter for either a television / cable modem hookup or a television with PIP ( picture - in - picture ) capability in conjunction with a cable box or satellite receiver ! I highly recommend this outstanding cable splitter to any and all who 're interested in getting the best picture available from their television sets or signal for their cable modems . The end results far outweigh the costs for this splitter ! { ssintrepid }
4 #### I use these for karaoke and at the price , it 's worth going cheap and replacing them every 6 months or so once enough people have slammed them on the floor . The XLR cords could be sturdier , but they 're so cheap it does n't really matter .
5 #### There really is n't a lot you can say about this item other than it works ! I use expensive guitars and I know the importance of humidification to keep your instrument in top shape and these work .
5 #### Wow . This is a good range extender . I am new to the shortwave game , but I must say , this is a good antenna for my YB300PE . I am hearing stations I did n't think I 'd be able to get . I am new to the whole shortwave genre , but this is good . It is very easy to use and it does add to your antennas normal range .
5 #### This is a really great speaker for Bluetooth capable phones . I love how it easily clips to the sun visor and also has a really good sound quality to it .
5 #### They are just fine . Quality was good and price was in line with local stores .
5 #### I needed a pair of binoculars that were small enough to fit in the car . You never know when you 'll need them but it 's nice to know they are there .
5 #### This Bluetooth was not that bad actually , the volume it perfect for when I m driving and the person on the other line can always hear me . I like my bluetooth ! I think its a KEEPER ! =)
5 #### They work the best on the " Tele " mode . I use them into a small digital handheld recorder . Place a few of them around for great sound for your videos .. Excellent mic for the price . Great starter mic and it looks really nice sitting atop your camcorder . Once I pointed one at the loud speaker at a football game . I placed it on a tripod and let the digital recorder run all game while I shot video from the sidelines . I suppose it was maybe 70 ' from the loudspeaker . It made EXCELLENT mix sound for the football game . Just the right ammount of crowd ambiance and distance from the pole speaker . Very , very pleased .
5 #### Replaces the same model previously installed that was broken . Easy to install - 4 screws . Eventho it was missing the bumpers it did not detract from my like of the item .
2 #### a bit too short , even for 6 string lap steel . the end of the bar tends to get hung up on the high strings when i play on the lower strings and then return to the high strings . get the long dawg instead . :)
5 #### I bought these to use with my Breedlove acoustic bass , and was very impressed . The closest thing I 've seen to get a natural , almost finger style sound with more volume . Does n't slip or flex , and it is , as the name says , stubby , so it puts the point of contact very close to your fingers . If you play acoustic guitar , you might want a lighter thickness , but this is a great pick and we 'll worth trying .
2 #### I 've bought a bunch of these over the last few years and 75 % of them have gone bad within 2 years . They simply do n't last . Get something better .
5 #### Fit perfect ! A must have for those who wants to block out as much UV as possible .
4 #### Who ever designed these head phone are out of the box for sound . ,These headphones are incredible . Cheap but not resilient . You got to take care of them . They are the best sound for I pad or your cell phone . So many people look for the best at a price they respect .
3 #### There are better sounding headphones . But , if you 're after isolation they work really well .
4 #### phone looks new , operates fine but program is a bit newer than my old one so the icons and keys work a bit different . the sad thing is that after ordering the phone , my old one started working again ? ? ? do n't know what happened but now i have two razrs - the price was right !
5 #### This is excellent quality but a little too long for a child . Love the brown color with acoustic guitar .
5 #### I have bought others previously that did n't work but this one works perfectly . Quick service not much time before receiving it in the mail
5 #### Great idea to have these on hand and price is right .
3 #### Decent set of strings . Sound is not great . The feel & playability is spot on though . I would say for the price you can not beat it .
3 #### Budget smart phone with some kick aXX capabilities . But symbian is slow , screen is small , no front camera for video calls , so you can have them see you , but you ca n't see them or the opposite . Brwser is a joke . Very small speaker inside , meaning highest volume is pretty low just because of the speaker size by default . Most of the features available in Europe , not really for USA . I believe you can do better for the money .
5 #### great buy for the price . I use these on my runs . I like the over the ear design as my ears seem to hurt after a while with the in - the - ear designs . These also keep me a little warmer during those cold runs .
1 #### Bought this from amazon after reading all the hype . I had just previously tried the Blueant Z9 and been disappointed ( it did n't cancel noise - in fact produced phantom noise of its own to the listener . ) I was really hoping the Jawbone would be the killer noise reducing BT headset , but it 's not cancelling noise either . And yes - I have the nub touching my cheek . My wife said she could hear all the noise in the background clearly , so I had her use it and sure enough - I could hear everything . Maybe I got a dud , but I 'm so weary of trying to find a good noise cancelling BT headset that I 'm not in the mood to try a replacement - it 's going back pronto . Back to the wired theBoom headset for me !
5 #### Bought tons of these in the 80 's , and 90 's , now they are like gold . Used to get 3 for the price of one of these , but I 'm sure they 've stopped producing them now , so they will be precious if you can find them . Ca n't beat the quality of the Maxells , if only I had stashed a few packs of these things years ago !
5 #### I really like these things . I do n't stick tape and stuff to guitar body which if they do make a double sided tape similar to post it notes might be a good idea . Bought a few while back and just bought a few more . If you drop a pick there is another right there . Have fun .
4 #### i 've had better cables but not by much and this is probably one of the better values
4 #### I 'm not a pro but this one meets all my needs . a bit heavy to carry around but the wide angle makes it worth
5 #### DISCLAIMER : I am beginner guitarist ( about 1 year ) , so I probably can not do a good job of comparing these strings with a everything that is out there . I found that these strings are easy on the fingers and they have nice and balanced tone . I had Elixir Light Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings before . I did n't really like them so I replaced them with these . I felt that the Elixirs were harder to fret than these , and they also had a tinny and unnatural sound . These strings are a little delicate , so try to be careful so that you do n't make them too tight when stringing them on your guitar . I broke a string when I was stringing mine , but I was so satisfied with the playability that I ordered two more sets .
5 #### I gave my older Jabra bluetooth speaker to my son to use , and ordered this newer version . Setup is easy , like the older version it can connect to two phones at the same time which is very handy . However , this newer version does n't seem to have as loud a speaker as it 's predecessor . I found I had to turn down radio or AC so I could hear some calls better . It is n't a deal breaker and if it was quiet in my vehicle I could hear the call great , but just something I noticed because I can compare it to the older version . I still give it 5 stars for ease of use , the ability to stream music from my iPhone and for handling my iPhone and Blackberry connections simultaneously . It also is much cheaper than the older version ( maybe due to smaller speaker ? Not sure why ) . I am very happy with the device . I do n't use it every day and I noticed it holds a charge for a long time so that too is a plus .
4 #### I have been using these for about an year now , and they are the best ones under $ 40 that I 've owned . Here are some plus points : 1 . very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit 2 . compact enough to be carried around , without loss in the bass ! :) Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break . The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart . A very good buy , and highly recommended . -Amarendra
5 #### Made gapping my plugs quick and easy and a good way to check them all while having this tool easily available .
4 #### tried these again , but prefer the John Pearse over these .
3 #### So we purchased this headset because of all the mostly wonderful raving reviews . For the first hour when my husband called me it sounded perfect .... I did n't even know that he had it on . I breathed a sigh of relief . Then he calls me later on and it is extremely choppy ... the next day he is barely discernable and everytime the phone rings , I ca n't even hear him . We are confused ... it sounded perfect and then it went kaput . He did n't drop it ! The only thing that he can come up with is that he was sweating because we were having a heat wave in NYC and maybe that messed it up . The sweat ; that is ! So I called Amazon , they sent me a new one which we will be trying out today . I even called Plantronics at Amazons ' suggestion just to make sure that it was n't an issue on our end . The verdict is that their customer service is exceptional ! Very helpful and took the time to understand my concerns . We reset and resync'ed and still it sounds horrible . Our phones are the Sprint Samsung Instincts . Plantronics said that they do not have them on their list and they are still in the beginning testing phase and that may be the issue . So , I gave it 3 stars for the first hours of use . I am hoping that we truly received a dud and that it is n't a phone compatibility issue or sweat for that matter . Will update soon !
5 #### Bought a sound bar for my older LCD screen . . . but the included cable did n't fit my TVs output which is the old = fashioned RCA plugs . Bought this cable to replace the one that came with the soundbar . It works perfectly .
1 #### For the price , you would think that the cable would hold up to the daily use for at least a month . Well , these cables broke within a month , all three ! What a waste of money that was !
3 #### After hours of research and experimenting I found that you need to hold down the phone button while turning power switch on to enter mating mode . Seems somewhat obvious now but when you add in all the variables it became a pain in the ass . Very fragile plastic will break if not carried around on top of a pillow when not in use . More wasted time trying to get poorly documented technology to work . ( I think I subconciously enjoy it ) . On a positive note I did buy these for $ [ ... ] new when they were being sold for $ [ ... ] everywhere else ( probably with the correct instructions ) .
5 #### This charger turns the phone on and charges it . Only been using a few days , but the plug fits into the phone well and the transformer ( ? ) does not get hot .
5 #### I bought this because it was exactly what i was looking for . I 've used this phone for over 2 years now and I still have it
4 #### I needed to replace the string guide on a 1990 Fender Telecaster ( USA ) , and this was the perfect piece . Thanks !
5 #### Beautiful sturdy case . I bought it for my Ibanez Bass and it fits really well . This is a quality case . Money well spent .
4 #### I am in agreement with others that state this is a must - have . I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard . This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood . I 've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard . I rub the entire neck down before and after I play . It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop , which I suspect is what they must 've been using all these years and never told me , though I never did ask ... foolish me . Since I 've recently gotten into doing my own setups , where I 've read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck , it 's less than $ 5 .
5 #### WORK WELL WITH HANDCUFFS VERY GOOD COVER LOOKS GREAT AND WORKS WELL I WILL TELL WHERE I BOTH IT FROM
3 #### I 've used Fram oil filters the better part of 40 years and in the olden days they were top quality and used in industry . Today Fram does n't even make filters , they 're contracted out and you know what that means . If you read various blogs , reviews and reports about dissected oil filters of all makes Fram is the one to stay clear of . Just recently I had personal experience with a PH8A Fram Extra Guard with 1,021 miles on it . The engine bearings were making " loose " noises on startup in the morning . It seems that anti - drainback valve failure is a common problem with these and also plugging to the point that the pressure relief valve opens and allows unfiltered oil through the engine . There have been reports of the filter media detaching and plugging the oil passage completely so there 's no lubrication at all . Take it with a grain of salt but you really ought to read the reviews and comments of others that have had problems with Fram filters . One of the top replies to questions about engine noises is " are you using a Fram filter ? " I will say one good thing about it , it kept the oil very clean for 1k miles but that filter was very heavy when I removed it and possibly bypassing so be aware .
5 #### A missle attack in Pittsburg in 2073 causes the surviving students and scientists to fight for survival in a fallout shelter of Helmsby 's Research Center . The suvivors believe there is fallout from the attack and that they are the only survivors so they stay hidden for 3 years until they are too low on supplies to survive . They come out of their shelter to find that are surrounded by vicious shifter animals that will shred them to pieces if caught . The survivors learn that the military is involved and what they believed happened is not what happened . They are behind a military zone fenced off from the rest of the world with the savages . Very exciting story .
5 #### Great product . Just opened the packeage and hooked - up my printer . I am glad I opted for the longer cable . It 's just right .
5 #### I liked this very much to clean VHS heads . They play so much better and clearer after using this .
4 #### While maybe not top of the line , these D'Addario Zyex Violin Strings are quite nice . I am just a casual violin player and have both the traditional instrument and an electric . They definitely sounded at least a little warmer and fuller on the acoustic instrument and are certainly a big improvement over the stock strings on the electric . On both instruments they respond wonderfully the ( well rosined ) bow and needed very little break - in time . The price is right and quite a value in my opinion . Zyex Strings will make a cheap instrument sounds good and a quality instrument sound even better ! ~ Kort
4 #### I have tried numerous strings and find these work and sound the best for my electric guitars .
5 #### This cartridge was easy to install in the tonearm of my Empire 598 II turntable from 1973 . I used to run Shure V15 - III and IV cartridges , back in the day , but this Audio Technica sounds every bit as good to me listening to the old vinyl . I plan to buy another as a spare soon . This has a universal mount , so you can use it on modern tonearms , too . I think you 'd have to spend $ 60 - 100 more to really notice any difference in sound quality versus a " better " cartridge , which would be a minimal difference .
5 #### These are my go to sticks . I gave a set to my buddy and he loves them as well . Very thin and agile . However , they are rather fragile and do not last too long , especially the heads .
5 #### Fits my helmet perfectly , great deal for the price , no problems with flying up or falling off at high speeds . make sure the visor clicks in place when all the down .
4 #### The 303 Products 30520 Convertible Fabric Top Cleaning and Care Kit is great for cleaning canvas tops . I reccomend taping off anything you do n't want overspray on with the protectant as that stuff is hard to get get off after it dries
5 #### A lot of personal preference goes into choosing a set of strings . For me these are a good balance between tone , feel , longevity and price . As a casual player , at home to unwind and occasionally with family and friends , these are the strings I 've used for my last few changes and have no reason to change .
5 #### Awesome ! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too ... ca nt go wrong get this doit just do it
2 #### Do not like . The wire gets caught in the folding pieces and cuts it . Not for kids at all .
5 #### Ease of use . Worked as specified . Easy to put away . Helped us get the job done safely.thank you so much .
5 #### I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic , so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money ( as compared to non - coated brands ) . They seem to create less noise from unintentional slide friction -- it 's sort of like the difference between flatwound and regular strings -- these feel like super - flatwound strings , meaning they feel smooth . I have some nice callusses built up , but I imagine that I 'd like these strings even more if I was just starting out ( or restarting ) because I imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than non - coated strings .
3 #### I bought the Jabra Bt-3030 Headset for myself at christmas this year to go with a new Lg dare phone . The blue tooth paired up easily . The blue tooth sound quality is good but not as good as a hard connection . I do n't care for loud music but the volume needs to be a little louder on this device . Calls are clear on it and the remote answers promptly . I m keeping it , but not sure if I would buy it again .
5 #### I have used Elixir for a long time and still find that they are the best strings available . I have never had a single issue with them whether they were for my 12 string , my Taylor acoustic / electric , my Fender Strat or my mandolin . They always perform well and sound great .
1 #### It 's a fun camera if you do n't mind expensive mini prints . The sticky film can be fun . It 's a fun digital camera too , except Polaroid is too stupid to put even basic software on the web . Do n't lose the CD . If you thought you 'd take the camera and your laptop on a fun trip ( because the camera only holds small photos ) do n't lose the CD ! ! You wo n't be able to view pictures ever again if you lose the CD . And without USB ? What were they thinking ? Getting pictures out of this thing is like watching paint dry .
5 #### Does exactly what I need made well should last a long time . Roomy
5 #### This is an absolutely wonderful case . I can use it for my phone or my Sony TX-7 . It has a magnetic clasp , looks good , and the leather is very soft . The clip on the back is very sturdy and strong . You can also rotate the clip so it 's easy to wear upright or to the side . The price is excellent and even though it 's quite cheap , it does n't feel or look cheap . It really does the job well in a stylish manner . Excellent value ! I would definitely recommend !
2 #### Maybe this charging station would have been nice 5 or 6 years ago before smartphone got larger screens but other than in the larger middle section a phone will not fit . The sections are too small and if the charger has to be plugged in the side rather than in the bottom the phone wo n't fit even if it is smaller . Definitely NOT worse the price .
2 #### the wife ordered this . Being discontinued should have been a clue . Poor reception . Scratchy volume control
3 #### I have a 2012 Ram 3500 with a 6.7 liter Cummins diesel . The reusable filter I have is a K&N E-0784 Air Filter which has more surface area than most . I believe in the 3R 's ...... Reduce , Reuse & Recycle . I have just performed my first cleaning and oiling of my reusable filter and although I was unsure how many times I expected the filter care kit to work on my filter I was disappointed to find it 's good for just one servicing . Also , I found using these squeeze bottles to be a bit of a PITA . I may try an aerosol applicator next time if the propellant is eco - friendly .
5 #### My original Motorola Q phone would n't hold a charge for more than 2 hrs . I found this and it works like a champ . Been using the battery for a few months now and it holds a charge for 2 days ( unless you 're surfing the net a lot ) . Very happy with the price and performance .
5 #### these string I place above all others very good ..
5 #### Works as advertised , great for keeping the car clean of dust and pollen . Saves a lot of washing .
5 #### Excellent item that protects my digital camera well ; Has nice sized external pocket to carry extra batteries ( 4 AA ) and extra memory card . Very durable and still looks new after 2.5 years of use . Have taken it to India / Abu Dhabi & back as well as all over the US and still hold up well .
3 #### Seems like the product itself is good but the nozzle likes to clog up no matter how much I shook it before hand . I had one can that was still half full due to this . I had better luck with Fluid Film .
5 #### Guards went on my 1999 Ford Expedition very easily . They really look great .
5 #### This stuff is amazing . I run it through the lawn mower about once a year and use it at almost every fill up . I notice smoother acceleration and a slight reduction in engine noise ( very slight , it is still internal combustion ) . The price break on two containers is worth it , especially since the lid actually seals and wo n't leak out or evaporate
5 #### This is the top of the line as far a leak prevention goes . Plumbers and HVAC professionals use this instead of Teflon paste ; and they introduced me to the blue paste . First time using ; you will understand why they prefer Leak Lock . Eliminates call backs .
5 #### Product fit my machine as disclosed in the description . This is the first time I have had to refill the tape in this machine , which I have owned for several years . It was wonderful to find the refills on Amazon and at a great price .
5 #### Fast shipment , well packed , good price , product as promised all a customer can ask for
3 #### Cheap replacement batteries . Note , they are NOT NEW . Ordered two , both were in used condition ( scratches on contacts , dirt , pocket fuzz and other signs ) . Ask seller to please resend NEW batteries as it was listed . Received two more used batteries , although very quickly . Seller is very reactive and polite , but lacks the understanding of new . The batteries hold a charge and have n't blown up . I guess this is something . Buy if you want a cheap replacement battery , but not because it is new .
5 #### This pop filter is really good it gives you clarity to your voice , everyone with a mic should use one , for this you need to use a heavy mic stand a recomend a on stage one I use the desk version . If you try to use it in a light one it will fall , the clip that comes with it is good , but you need to put it all the way insid or it will fall , depending on the thickness of your stand you might have to pull it out the way out . Looks a little bit cheap , could 've been better but its still good
5 #### Easiest way to protect lower body , and hides minor flaws in the finish
5 #### I share a house and always wonder if something might happen . These add extra security . Locks are meant to keep honest people honest . Of course any really determined thief will get them off but at least these will slow them down and maybe make them look for any easier target .
4 #### The quality of the photographs taken by this camera is wonderful , and it 's easy to use . HOWEVER ... for me , it did not work with Windows 2000 even after downloading Kodak 's most up - to - date drivers . The good news : Kodak 's service department is terrific , and they shipped me a Kodak USB card reader -- free and overnight ! All is hunky - dory with the camera now , and all in all I 'm quite pleased with my purchase .
5 #### Great for people shooting indoors . Bouncing is flexible with the tilt - and - swivel feature . I also like the auto - zoom from 24 to 105 .
5 #### I finally got around to installing my new camera in my iPhone . I had no problem with the new camera , it takes good pictures and videos . The biggest problem I encountered was installing in the camera in the iPhone . It takes longer to put the phone back together than it takes taking it apart . So many tiny screws . The camera arrived way ahead of the expected delivery date , I just took my time in doing the install .
5 #### This works pretty much as expected . just think aboiut buying 2 cans if you want to do all 4 wheels for brakes .
4 #### It works great , but needs an LED bulb replacement : it gets pretty hot .
5 #### Monster Rock - 21 ' Instrument Cable - Angled to Straight 1/4 " plugs is excellent and according with my requirement . Thanks .
1 #### I 've tried a bunch , in the ear and out . This one is very uncomfortable , even though they give you three different inserts and ear bands . It has to stay touching your skin around the jaw to work properly and it just does n't stay put . All of a sudden people say , " hey I ca n't understand you any longer . " When it is working I am told it sounds very tinny and , on my end the incoming sound is pretty good but I kept getting beeps ( series of three , single ascending or descending , several variations ) that the factory had no explanation for . Their people are very pleasant but do n't seem very well versed on the product . They are quick to tell you how wonderful it is though . I tried the manual but it is really useless . Sorry . I was really looking forward to this product after all the hype . I 'll stay with the Motorola H710 . It 's " wear all day " comfortable and , more important , it works !
5 #### Bought this battery to replace a dead watch battery . Worked fine , batteries not expired . Saved quite a bit not only on the batteries but installing the battery in my watch . I also purchased a watch battery replacement kit on Amazon .
5 #### I have used a few different capo 's this is far and away my favorite . Very easy to take it off , holds the strings tight . What more can you ask for ? Does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive .
4 #### I 've had this for well over a year now , and it works great . It is a little cumbersome to use at times , but the amount of charge it delivers has allowed me to recharge my phone three to four times before even putting a dent in the capacity of the New Trent external battery .
4 #### I like that I do n't have to worry about overspray . It does n't leave a problem residue on the windows or chrome - wipes off fine , though I usually just leave it . But the lustrous appearance does n't last very long ( maybe a week or two , parking it outside at the beach in San Diego . Maybe longer . ) I do all the black trim on my Ford Escape , and the can lasts about 3 uses . I guess 2 - 3 cans a year . It 's better than looking at my black trim all faded to grey ! And it only takes me 5 minutes .
5 #### much more comfortable than the stock shift ball and I would assume less cumbersome than the ones that look like grenades . fits into the jeep great so I ca nt complain . the ease to install this is really based on your ability to get the old ball off the stick . this took maybe 45 seconds to install , but either way I would bye it again with out hesitation .
1 #### This product look great out of the box but a month later the nylon loops that hold the clip and the belt loop is unraveling and part of the nylon is loose and flapping . this wo n't last another month .
1 #### super small and the remote on has a manual feature
5 #### They 're comfortable and sound good and I have n't noticed the lack of treble that I read in someone 's review , though I 'm no kind of sound expert either . They 're not as inconspicuous as I had hope for , but they do n't hurt my ears like like the older earbud style and they block alot of external sound . Like wearing earplugsI've gotten several complaints because I did n't respond to someone trying to talk to me unless I could see them .
4 #### The way it spins onto the engine block is almost sensuous . Perfectly machined threads ; makes you want insert it over and over again . Seriously , how do you review an oil filter ?
5 #### This screen protector is great . Sure it may cost more then some others , but you only need one . Others come with packs of three , so they can be replaced . You can feel the quietly right away . I love this product and would recommend this for anyone with a smart phone .
5 #### This is the same exact product that came with my high intensity light it has afforded me great opportunity to see while walking through the woods . Surprise surprise the battery stayed charged with high long lasting light beam for long time .
5 #### Received package based on projected dates . Happy with the purchase .
4 #### EASY TO INSTALL , BUT I FOUND OUT THAT IF YOU UNPLUG IT THAT YOU HAVE TO RESET THE DISTANCE TO THE CAR , SO I WAS WONDERING IF THE POWER GOES OFF AND YOU DON'T KNOW IT , WELL , THE RED LIGHT WILL NOT COME ON UNTIL IN MY CASE , YOU WILL BE TOO CLOSE AND BAM GOES THE WALL . I THOUGHT THE BATTERIES WOULD BE A BACK - UP WHEN THE POWER GOES OFF BUT IT SAYS NOT TO LEAVE THE BATTERIES IN IF YOU PLUG IT IN . ON THE GOOD SIDE IT WORKS VERY WELL WHEN THE POWER IS ON BILL
4 #### Easy to install , and works nicely to mute vibrations in car panels . I recently used some to dampen the rattling in an industrial shelf installed in the back of my cargo van , and it made a night and day difference . In lining my ford E350 standard length cargo van , I used two of the bigger boxes , and one of these boxes to line everything except the cargo bed floor . I will note that this smaller box came with the sheets folded over ; they unfolded okay , though the shipped - flat sheets are nicer to work with . Also , the larger box comes with a large cardboard sheet the size of the dynamat sheets , and the cardboard sheet is very convenient as a backing when cutting these .
4 #### I live in an apartment complex and a friend recommended this to me when I was having issues with my phone reception . after I hooked it up , my reception was greatly increased and no dropped calls ! This is definitely one of the best boosters available
4 #### This is the best in - car Bluetooth accessory in my experience . Reduced one star for inability to pair with more than 2 phones . Used with : iPhone Nexus One Droid Incredible 2 HTC Sensation
5 #### When stocking the RV for the first time , it 's important to put this gripping fabric down on all the shelves . That keeps your dishes , food and other supplies from moving around in the cabinets as you bump along down the road . It does n't stick down ( non - adhesive ) , it just lays in there but that is enough to do the job . It 's like the non - slip stuff you put under throw rugs .
5 #### THIS WAS A REPLACEMTN BATTERY FOR MY INTESITY II . IT STAYED CHARGED AND WORKED GOOD . THEN THE PHONE BROKE AND THAT WAS THE END OF USING THIS BATTERY .
5 #### I was hitting a wall before I discovered this . The dry is incredible . No streaks , spots , particles . Low maintenance also .
5 #### This is a great addition to my cell phone . It makes hands free a breeze . It also saves my neck and hands from holding the phone when I am busy .
5 #### Got the tuneband for it 's open , simple design and full access to apps , volume & controls , earphone Jack etc . iPhone fits easily and well into the soft shell . The wide armband for me is too long for wrist wear ( bmi 23 ) but is slip free to upper arm during active housework sessions . Am currently using it with skullcandy headphones but as all openings are accessible , you could attach other items . It 's also not too bulky so it could be worn under a sleeve in public places .
5 #### Easy to install . Living room much improved with speaker cords hidden . I fit four 16 gauge speaker wires with no problem .
5 #### Simple to install and works as described . Not cheap plastic . Mine Came with the bolts so no need to order new ones .
5 #### great quality build and looks like it last for many years .
4 #### This is my 3rd bluetooth . Works very well , my others had lots of static and noise , this has minimal noise . also fits very well to my ear . Only thing I do n't like , when I 'm outside , for some reason the wind interfears with my reception , I ca n't hear the person I 'm talking too , and they ca n't hear me . Works great indoors though . Would recommend .
5 #### I have installed 4 of these switches . They are plug and play . The ones I have installed do not have a fan and are totally quiet . This unit runs very cool ; it barely gets warm . The first one I installed was about a year ago , and I have had no problems . The switches are not managed , and if you need to set up virtual LANs you can not do that . UPDATE 17 May 2013 : Still have the 4 switches running , and no problems with them . Update Feb 25 , 2014 : I still have the 4 switches running , and have had no problems with them . I have never had any of these switches get hosed - up where I had to power them down to reset them . They just work . I have them powered from UPS back up power systems which probably helps with their reliability . Update March 31 , 2015 I still have the 4 switches . Never have had a problem . I have them on a UPS and have never had one hose up since I first installed them . Update April 18 , 2016 First switch installed in 2011 and all are still working with no problems . They are powered by UPS and never get glitches or need to be power cycled . Great unmanaged switch ! !
5 #### I had this Bluetooth before and lost it , I was so bummed . I just love this , you can listen to your music thru it and I have a few sports apps that I can listen to the games anywhere my phone works .
5 #### Ordered this replacement card . My original cratered on me . No problems with software .... worked perfect .
5 #### Replaced my Chevy S10 truck 's pulse board with this one , and now my windshield wiper works perfectly ! Easy 5 minute job .
5 #### Seems like good quality . The straw is metal , as is the canister . All connections have O - rings . My wimpy compressor ca n't drive it steadily at 125 psi . I think the cutoff valve constricts the flow .
5 #### Very comfortable , superb sound , durable . Still using them with no problems after 13 years .
2 #### The cable is crooked and pieces of plastic are still on the female end around the connection . It would be nice if the controls on the earphones worked with this extension cable . Sound is acceptable .
3 #### I know vhs is on it way out . first few time use blanks must use head cleaner to clean head . New machine VHS DVD combination . So I think maybe skipping step or to on making tape .
5 #### A chore to put on protecting everything but works GREAT !
5 #### I have been a big fan of TrackMan mouses ever since I started playing Half Life . IMO there is no better mouse to use with a FPS than a TrackMan . The wireless version of this mouse lives up to the excellent quality reputation that Logitech has built over the years . There is a bit of a " getting used to it " period , but that will soon pass , and you will wonder how you ever used a regular mouse , with the mouse pad , and the laser , and the clickity - clickity ..... One of the best benefits of this product is it 's ability to help reduce the chance of developing carpal tunnel disease . I have been working in IT for 11 years now , and do EXTENSIVE work at my PC , and have not had any issues yet ( knock on wood ) . For gamers and regular PC users alike , I would highly recommend this product .
5 #### Quality capo and there is n't much more to be said , if you are in the market for a capo this one will do just fine .
4 #### This is my second purchase of this item ... I ran down the first battery by overcharging ... oops ! I love that my battery goes all day , sometimes TWO without having to charge ! I wish there were choices for a colorful or skins for the outer protected cover . It is bulky and boring - looking .
1 #### More of a design thing but not for vocal recording you can clearly hear the sound coming out of these right in your mic .
5 #### Perfect gauge for Les Paul if you want to do any moderate drop - tuning . In other words , the perfect GnR strings :)
5 #### I use these picks primarily for strumming , but they have a great grip , and work great . I doubt they 'll ever wear out , and though I use .60-.80 for whatever I 'm doing on my acoustics , these are among my favorite picks , and I use these the Clayton 's , and a few others , but for .60 picks these are really nice , and I tend to pick them out of the box when I start to warm up with a pick .
3 #### With a lot of use , this winder will most likely fall apart pretty easily ( has n't yet , for me . I do not use it often ) . Not high quality . But , if used only occasionally , I think that it will work and last for a while . Use gently .
5 #### As always , Monster cables are usually very good ... I use the bass , guitar and speaker cabinet cables , and have been . One word of caution , though . I 've had a couple fail , and getting in touch with Monster concerning their lifetime guarantee is a bit challenging and time consuming . And when you finally talk to someone , you either have to have a receipt for the bad cable , or as I was also told , I could take my chances and mail it in . They said that there are many counterfeits and if my cable proves to be one , they will not mail it back . Who keeps a receipt in the strong box for a guitar cable ?
5 #### it is a very straight forward reverb pedal , and if you like to manipulate your effects individually this is the way to go . 100 % recommended . good quality sound . and the feature of different " types " of reverb is great , you can chose the sort of " projection " and " height " of your reverb sound
5 #### Purchased this kit to wire my running lights on the Jeep . The lights were factory and even had a factory wire connected , but no place in the cab to turn the lights on and off . The owners manual showed a switched on the end of the blinker control arm , but my model ( 2002 Jeep Wrangler Sport ) did n't have this option . I read several online reviews and decided to go with the KC model because of the 40 AMP relay and that it had multiple fuses . I modified the kit by clipping the connectors that would normally go with KC HiLites and wired them to my existing bumper lights . I replaced the rocker switch ground and the relay ground with longer wires so I could connect to my frame to firewall ground and the inside the cab ground locations , respectively . For the Rocker switch , I went with the Daystar KU80014 20 AMP Red Light kit , so I could use it with the existing cutouts that most Jeeps come with already on the dash . The 3 wires from the relay connected directly to the Daystar kit without any problems . I recommend this kit to anyone needing to wire exterior lights on any truck or automobile .
5 #### Great oil . I use it in my Rotax 582 and have n't had any issues .
4 #### I 'm a Rotosound string guy for sure , but I wanted to experiment with different brands as an experiment . I was becoming perturbed with roundwounds due to the excessive noise and the grip they had on my fretting fingers . In my search I discovered that I really like the feel and sound of flatwound strings , so I put a set on my P bass . However , I could not find the sound I was looking for in my Jaguar bass until I bought the Rotosound RS77LD Jazz Bass ( 45 - 105 ) . Now I 'm happy with the jag and will purchase a set of Rotosound RS77LD Jazz Bass ( 45 - 105 ) as a replacement for the Fender flats on my P bass
4 #### The only thing I wish these had was some means to loop through , so that they could be attached securely to one end of the cable . Otherwise I just wrap one end around the cable and staple the two ends together , and now it 's " permanently " tethered to one end . I guess the only other downside might be that the option to purchase a single colour was not available . What if you want to have only one colour for your cables , so that they do n't end up being in your partner 's case ? And I suppose the colours could 've been brighter . But they do look nice , and there 's plenty of length to handle just about any normal length of cable being wrapped up .
5 #### Have n't had much reason to take off the roof rack , but I 'm glad now that no one else will try . Easy to install and now have piece of mind .
4 #### This thing does exactly what it 's supposed to do . -1 star for being a single - tasker . I do n't really need any more special purpose tools hanging on the garage wall .
2 #### Bought these to add to a 90s MIM Strat . The problem is they do n't place enough tension on the strings causing the strings to buzz . Look over your guitar before using these . You may want to place them closer to the nut to increase tension since you ca n't adjust the height . Planning to buy the old vintage ones that are lower since I do n't want multiple holes in the headstock .
5 #### Do n't leave home without them , been playing for 50 years I use them on all my guitars !
5 #### Its a repeat purchase and they work as good as my earlier ones
5 #### Awesome . I have n't found a dud in the package yet !
5 #### This is a nice capo -- does what it 's supposed to do and looks nice also .
3 #### These are small and work ok . The feel really cheap and the black part is n't really squashy . Overall it 's ok .
3 #### these are ok , they are slim and easy to handle . they fit in your shirt pocket very well . I think the only thing I did n't care for is there are not enough colors to choose from
4 #### I had a hard time deciding between the Olympus 3030 and the Nikon 990 . In the end , I choose the Olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature . ( I bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family . ) I really like how easy it is to take basic pictures . Family picture takers will like this camera . It takes great pictures , easy to transfer using USB , and comes bundled with great software . The camera is also very compact - its about the size of an average point and shoot . The only thing that I would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible . It is relatively easy to use , but I have not mastered making quick changes yet . A great addition would be a quick menu system in the top LCD area instead of having to power up the monitor . Or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes . You will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features . They are not that intuitive for a Nikon SLR user ... If you are buying this camera , you should also get extra memory and batteries . You should also invest in either an external memory reader or the AC Power Adapter . I have n't tried rechargeables yet , but that may be my next purchase .
2 #### Let me just say that when I first got this I was ready for it to not be so great because the price seemed to good to be true . Right out of the package the remote did n't work , but i figured i 'd keep it anyway mostly because I was too lazy to send it back . It worked fairly well EXCEPT when you travel through certain areas it would lose the signal . It would eventually come back and it keeps your ipod or iphone charged . another issue it has if you drive a SUV like me is when I turn sometimes it rotates in the outlet and goes sideways .... I have had it about 4 months and now one of the screws fell out and in my messy truck i ca n't find it so its laying on the center console . Great idea if it would fit tighter and was constructed better .
5 #### Good universal mud flap for a pick - up . Heavy duty , easy to trim and install . I expect them to last a long time .
5 #### Like I said about another case for a Samsung Infuse , for these large phones , you have to buy cases that protect perfectly , but , that are not gona duplicate the size of your phone . Now , I have to add , that you have to buy flexible cases , cause hard cases always scratch the phones . Yhis one in particular , perfectly fits the Galaxy SII ) T - Mopbile ) , and I feel completle confortable with it . It looks like it 's gon na protect the phone when it falls down ( wich I spect never happens ) . The only thing I do n't like that much , is that the case seems a little loose on the top , but nothing really important . I recommend this product .
5 #### You have to think of this as a educational device not a computer . HOWEVER it is a full computer just not very fast and the storage is tiny . It uses Linux so it is not easy for a windows user to use in command line mode . in GUI it is a full desktop like windows and you could just use it as a small web surfer but do n't expect much for that use .. . I have been trying to learn Linux for years on and off and still feel uncomfortable but I am getting better and using the raspberry is helping a lot . The great thing about it is you can load any programing language and use the ports on the board to do things from robots to just light LEDs . if you have a kid that is interested in computer programing or electronics a breadboard and raspberry well ... you could not find a better present . and it is cheep so if something goes wrong you are not out a lot .
5 #### I have never been more happy with a single purchase in my whole life period . Seriously buy this product as soon as possible , matter of fact buy two or three , you will wish you did .
5 #### Our internet had to be strung across our living room because our desk only fit on the opposite side . These are great because they install easily they hide the cord and they keep it out of the way of feet . I 'll be buying these again in the future .
5 #### It 's pretty hard to screw up a drum key and Gibraltar has been making them long enough that I 'd guess it 's pretty much impossible for them to fail at this one . The key was the right price and works quite well on my 96 model pearl export series . I 'll probably buy another one ... when I lose this one ... just like I lost the last one .
5 #### I 've used these strings for many years now . I think they are the best for the acoustic guitar .
3 #### Perfect for the price . They 're really mellow . Not super loud . But , they 're easy to put on and are reversible , which helps .
5 #### These mud flaps fit great on my 2007 Ram ! Seems like great construction and I used my old mud flaps as a template . They hang down just enough to provide ample protection but not too low to look old - manish ! Great buy !
5 #### I always need patch cables and I 've played with Monster and Planet Wave patch cables . These get the job done and if it does fry out I do n't feel bad about throwing them out .
5 #### This is my second one . I kept the first for a long time as it performed so well . I had tried jawbone ( which my wife loves ) , but was not as happy . When Super Glue could no longer keep the old one together I sent for this . Amazing price due to older technology , but this works really well . It sits comfortably with the over ear piece . Good sound for my " hard of hearing " ear , and so far no reverb .
5 #### I recently purchase a double receiver for my hitch so that I could use my bike rack and a small trailer . The bikes caused interference so I added a 12 " extension and the my wiring was a little short . Problem solved .
5 #### This works really good with my iPod , iPhone , iPad & Sharp FX Plus , I gave one to a friend for his Samsung Galaxy and it works really good he loved it , I think that I may need more , I recommend this product any where , any time & any how it 's easy to carry around , it 's just AWESOME ! ! !
5 #### Seems to work as good as the original filter by JDS company . It 's a must , to keep your shop clean of those fine dust particles that ca n't be seen . It 's very easy to install . I would recommend it to anyone with a woodworking shop .
5 #### I was looking for the larger capacity SD to supplement my SSD main drive and this 64 G microSD fit my needs very well . Absolutely no issues - works exactly as advertised and meets my needs perfectly !
1 #### I switched to android and i 'll never go back to symbian ( s60 ) . I do like the ease of multitasking / switching between running apps and being able to close apps . The phone is too thick and screen is too small . I like dual speakers , loud ringtone , app management , high rest 16 mil colors lcd , but touch sensitivity is crap compared to capacitive . For the price nokia could use resistive screen . Web browsing is doable but not great . My mostly used apps were gps / satnav garmin xt and nokia . Garmin was my mostly used app and nokia maps was for backup . Phone froze and had to be restarted often when gps was active . Driving sometimes was a nightmare . I now have a low end slightly larger lcd android phone and run five gps apps flawlessly . LCD is useless out in sunlight or mounted inside my car . I had to remove battery several times a day because phone froze often . Replacing original slow 8 gb sd card with class 6 seemed to slightly improve gps but phone still froze occasionally . I switched to android and could n't be happier .
5 #### So far , just out of the package , I love this lanyard ( and the other two like it I have purchased . ) I have NO way of knowing if the brand is truly Reiko as it came in a plastic bag . One of them that I received ( either purple or orange ) the bag it was in has " Oker Brand " printed across the bottom ... leading me to believe that it is either NOT Reiko as advertised or that it has been repackaged . The orange one appears to be exactly the same as the pink one I 've ordered , except for the color . This purple one is slightly different from them in that the ring that locks into place on the neck piece is actually metal instead of a metal looking ring surrounded by a plastic , metal colored ring . Not having actually put this into use yet , I can not vouch for the durability of it ... I will try to come back after some time to update my review .
1 #### I bought this coil to go along with my MSD distributor . I was running a Pertronix coil and having had one fail last year , I just did n't trust it ( though it was working fine ) . I received the Blaster 2 , put it on the car and it would n't start . Double checked the wiring and still no start . Re - installed the Pertronix coil and she fired right up . I then tested the MSD coil with a VOM and it showed no continuity . The coil appeared brand new and the packaging looked factory but it was dead on arrival . Maybe a fluke , but if you buy one of these , check it before you go to the trouble of installing it .
3 #### It is probably me but I have never yet managed to fit a screen protector without getting air bubbles . That said , these screen protectors are decent quality and are supplied with the full kit to clean and fit them . For the price I am not grumbling .
5 #### Fine lens , reasonable price , quick shipping & all around good service . All good . HjI
5 #### I put these Ernie Ball Earthwood Extra Light 80/20 strings on a Epiphone DR-100 acoustic guitar . These sound so much better then the strings that came on the guitar , it 's like night and day . Very happy with them and will buy them again in the future .
5 #### This is working just fine , and I 've had it for several months now , just fine
2 #### Did n't work for what i bought it ( car vacuum ) . Should 've listened to the other reviews .
5 #### As mentioned on several of the above reviews , they are slightly shorter and a little uncomfortable at first ... now they are the only stick that feels right to me ... there is something about these sticks .... i love them !
5 #### These strings sound very good , more volume than the light gauge on my Taylor 710 . They have a different feel than the regular light gauge too ( because some of the strings are heavier than the stock light gauge ) so it might take a little getting used to , but it should n't take too long .
5 #### These straps always do the job . Fair Price . Never have let me down in any way . They do n't frey or fall apart seem to last for ages Not too short ! ! Plenty of Length And as a footnote there is nothing worse than paying 30 beans for a strap then you get home and it 's too short - won't adjust out Stick with Ernie he knows straps
5 #### What can I say about the CD holder ? It does as advertised . One draw back is the pockets are large and , if not careful , you could push the CD way down and out of sight . Takes a little practice to keep jusssssst the tip of the CD exposed .
3 #### Cheap but they work . I use them for work so I do n't want an expensive pair to get messed up on the job .
5 #### This acessorie is well builded and do n't change the guitar 's pitch . No damages guitars neck . It 's so easy to use
2 #### I bought one of these units because of its waterproof rating . That is 30 minutes at 3.3 feet . Forget that one . The battery compartment is n't rated for this ..... so it leaks big time . I called Garmin about this and they said that nothing can be done . There is no fix . This was December 2000 . Since it eats batteries , I bought a Radio Shack digital camera battery kit . It has 4 ni - mh batteries rated at 1500mah and a chargerfor $ 22 . This unit worked very well . Since the batteries compartment is n't waterproof the batteries got wet . I was in sea water and these batteries got ruined . If you plan on buying this GPS and using it around water , I would be careful in not using expensive batteries in it . Windsurfing , Kayaking , canoeing , white water rafting and the rest , be careful . If you buy their super expensive cable , you can update your unit free from their web site . They do offer great upgrades for their products , free . Wow . I only give the unit 2 stars . I own three of their products and this is the worse one for not living up to what they say it will do . The best one out there for tuff service is the GPS 45 version .
4 #### Nice tire cover for the price :) It does start to ripple around the edges taking on the look of a bottle cap if that matters ...
5 #### I bought my first set of these in the late 80s / early 90s , and after trying out offerings from many different manufacturers , these are still my favorite headphones . I feel they rival the sound reproduction of cans costing hundreds more .
4 #### Wanted something to cut down on wind noise and vibration when driving with my sunroof open on my Chevy Avalanche . I was apprehensive about ordering one without seeing its quality or fit first , but I decided to take a chance . Glad I did . Fits just right and wind vibration when driving above 25 mph is now gone . Installation is easy , just getting it lined up evenly can be tough ( could just be me and my OCD tendencies ) . Overall happy with the purchase . Reason for 4 stars versus 5 has to do with packaging . Mine appeared to have been opened and resealed with scotch tape .
4 #### The pop filter screen is OK , but I still had incredible amounts of background noise on my recordings . I 'm not sure if it was the screen or the microphone . That is why I gave it four stars instead of five .
5 #### I have a number of these units , in use on three Corvettes , three John Deer Tractors , and a couple other batteries . Waterproof , mountable under the hood , quiet , reliable , safe for the batteries . I leave them on year around on some of my cars and equipment and have never had a battery failure .
4 #### Nice little cable to let me add an old CD player to my radio in the basement
5 #### I was needing something to keep cables organized and I took a chance on this and I am glad I did . They worked really well for me
5 #### Easy to install , simple to configure via the instructions . I 'm even considering buying a ' spare ' in case one goes out again on my two computers .
5 #### I like this guage / inflator . It works great , made in America and never lets me down .
4 #### So far it feels pretty good . I had purchased a different one previously and it was extremely slippery so I had to return it . I was leary about buying another but wanted one . This is comfortable in my hand and not slippery at all .
5 #### I purchased this cable as an experiment to see if I could connect my dynamic microphone ( GLS Audio ES-57 ) directly into my Tascam DR07 MK ii portable recorder without needing an external preamp . It works perfectly and the Tascam has plenty of gain to get the mic up to a decent recording level . Super convenient !
4 #### I have a Martin that came with SP Martin strings . I play with another guitarist and mainly play the licks . The SP string have incredible tone but are really hard on the fingers for bending . I tried these and they made playing the guitar much easier and allowed me to play longer . However , there is a tone difference when play cords , not as full .
5 #### Great price great to have it around when you need it
5 #### I really like this stuff but I was n't impressed with how it worked oh the faders . My experience was n't near as bad as the other reviewer 's though . It cleaned them right up for me but lost the smoothness totally and left them sliding too easy with no resistance whatsoever . I guess they make specific types of grease for that so if worse came to worse you can re - grease them after cleaning them but it does say that this product is for faders right on the can . I 'm still giving it 5 starts because I do n't even know if I can count on two hands how many times this product has came to me rescue and bailed me out in repairing and also salvaging gear .
5 #### I am using these cables to link multiple pcs to the same printer . They work perfectly !
3 #### They were only a buck as an add on item and work as expected . Honestly , it 's easier to use a small plastic rubber band if it 's a cord you 're going to constantly use ...
3 #### I bought this for our guitar player ( since she had the tendency to lose her picks . It works well , but there sometimes the picks fall because the gap increases ( probably because there are lots of picks ? ) .
4 #### these have very good sound . relatively comfortable on head . I like being able to hear surrounding sounds , so I appreciate that .
5 #### The Woody shipped quickly , fits my guitar really well after I trimmed the foam rubber inserts which the instructions were very clear that might have to be done ... It works well and it sounds great .....
5 #### Bought these as a future replacement if my clip happens to get caught and break . So far , my Cellet case has proven to be very durable as is the belt clip so I may not be needing these too soon !
4 #### Excellent tool and priced right too . Cutter is razor sharp and cuts with ease . The winder is smooth and quick . Good tool .
5 #### helps me out when using tripod and not moving the camera
1 #### I bought this for my mother who thew away the box . I would be sending this product back because it does not work ! It does n't even have a range of 6 feet ! At 5 feet it has so much noise on the modem it would not work . We then payed to put in a phone line instead , that works !
5 #### works great still using it after 3 years fits all my wheel bearings I have
5 #### There just is n't much to say about this ... They say put your MONEY where your mouth is ... I say put your PICK(s ) where your mouth is .. ! These clip to your mic stand , they securely hold about 8 to 10 extra picks , and they are right in front of you when you drop a pick , or break a pick ... And if you play out , on stage , for any length of time , there will be a time when you loose a pick . ! For just a few dollars you can a few extras close at hand , when you need them .. You wo n't have to stop the band , or go look for one between songs ... Or worse , pull one out of your pocket and drop your hotel pass , or car keys , on stage .. ( How embarassing to have to explain to the hotel front desk that some girl took your room pass while you were on stage ... ) NOT that I ever had that happen , L.O.L ...... Get One of these , just do it .. ! !
5 #### I 've got a dirt cheap studio set up into a Windows 7 laptop . Not an ideal recording environment . I run an MXL 990 into this TubePre from PreSonus . Even with the tube it comes with , it warms the sound up nicely without adding hiss or noise . Several friends have complimented me on the warmth and quality of the recordings I 've been putting out with this thing . Sure , there are better tube preamps out there , but for the price , you ca n't beat it .
5 #### Previously i had the ernie ball winder and it kind of got stucked when i was going to fast , also it did n't have the wire cuter so this tool is much better . It is well built , the plastic dosen't feel too chip like if it is going to wear off or break apart , it 's not slippery even when you have your hands sweat . The cutters are very sharp yoo do n't need much of an effort to cut the strings . it 's small enough to fit in my jeans pocket so i can carry it very easily . Very good , excelent price , good quality .
3 #### This Clay Bar is too mild . I can not use this on medium to heavy scratches and paint looks the same no change .
5 #### I love this mic it works on itouch 3generation 8 gb so well . I love it too much and wat a money saver too . Nothing more to say but to order it soon ! ! !
5 #### We ordered this for our cabin and it has helped us out tremendously . Way better service on our phones and computers . Make sure you put the box and the antenna away from each other .. one side of the house with one and the other side for the other .. works better ..
5 #### I just bought this and I ca n't say anything negative about it . It does it 's job . Nice basic product no need to look further
4 #### I think it should be noted that these string guides require 2 holes in the head stock for each guide . One for the screw , and one for a little aligning post on the underside of each string guide . None of the pictures show this post , but it 's there . I bought these to upgrade an old Squier Strat I had laying around , just for fun . I ended up having to drill holes for this aligning post , as the stock string guides only used a single hold for the screw . It was n't a big deal , but people should probably know that there may be some drilling involved depending on what your stock string guides look like , in case they 're not comfortable drilling into their guitar . Also ... the original string guides on my Strat were slightly offset ( not perfectly centered between the strings ) , so I had to mount these new roller guides on a slight angle in order to keep the strings running straight . That said , I think they 're well made and function exactly as described .
5 #### Holds phone securely . Does n't offer cushioning or shock absorbing . It takes the same abuse as the item it is mounted to . I am certain that the phone will stay in the cradle .
5 #### I just received this awsome lense to use with my Canon 10D and my T3 , I installed it on the 10D and the camera performed flawless I was having alot of ( error99 ) with a 75 - 300 mm from Tamron and I thought it was the Camera , but when I put this baby on , the camera just came alive and took some beautiful pictures , the best I 've shot since I bought this camera , subjects are sharp and the auto focus is fast and accurate , I ca n't say enough about this lense , Thank you Premier Pawn for this great lense 5 stars to both lense and Seller ...
4 #### I have been a " semi - Pro " musician for almost two decades . I play guitar and sing , mostly classic rock - blues - soul music . I recently bought the Nady PCM 200 Microphone , yes , mostly for the retro looks ... but also for the quality vocal sound I had read in reviews . I have not been disappointed . The Mic has eye appeal and the sound has been good . The cost factor was very reasonable . If you are looking for a retro style microphone that is built well , reliable , and very affordable , I suggest the Nady PCM-200 Microphone . I 'm pleased and so is my band !
4 #### Just replaced the original strings that came on my new Seagull S6 with these . I really like them . They feel and sound great . I went with lights and am very satisfied . I have only had them on a couple days so I can not comment on if they will last longer than what came on my guitar .
1 #### I purchased this item and it would not work when the headphone was plugged in all the way ... the sound was muffled . But it worked fine when the headphone was plugged in 3/4 of the way . Eforcity sent me a replacement at no charge but unfortunately the replacement does n't work at all .
5 #### Very sturdy and awesome pop filter . Adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter ! I would recommend this to anyone !
4 #### I bought the 32 gig . card for just that purpose , My Samsung phone , takes as good pictures as most cameras . In fact I like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s-4 . I would buy it again and again if I needed a lot of memory . I recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera . I like to take moving photos with my Samsung , and those 8 second runs take a lot of memory , now I do n't have to worry and running out of memory
5 #### I was a non - believer but it truly works great ! Spray on , daube with a soft natural bristle paint brush on matte black plastic trim . Wipe off excess .
5 #### I bought this right before a 10 hours plane ride where I knew my iPhone battery would n't last . On the flight , I charged up my iPhone twice - fully - and the Imax was still almost full . This is a really nice little product and I recommend it for anyone who need extra battery life for their iPhone ( i.e. , everyone ! ) . It 's so nice not having to worry about running out of juice .
2 #### Listening to music through these headphones is like listening to music through a blanket . Everything sounds muted , the highs do n't extend very far , the lows are almost non existent . Their sound is anything but clear . Dynamics ? Forget about it I 'm looking for a $ 20ish pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times . I figured these might do the job ... but wow was I wrong . I found the Sony MDR - XD100 , which is actually cheaper , sound much better . Did I mention the build quality sucks ? The XD100s are a little more durable but still leave much to be desired . Perhaps that 's just low end Sonys in general ? I 'm thinking about just dropping the extra few bucks for a pair of Sennheiser PX100s or AKG K81DJs . My main headphones are the Grado SR-80 and BeyerDynamic DT990s ... I know what good sounds like . All my music is either FLAC or 192 Kbps VBR mp3s . I 'm giving these headphones a two star because I 've heard worse ... and much better for cheaper .
5 #### I installed these on my RZR and they work GREAT ! I love the sound they put out and they are a breeze to install . They come with all the hardware you need to mount them and get them attached to power but you will need to supply the switch .
4 #### Helped a bit more over the usual phone cable you get with your modem or computer . Speed went from 399 whatevers to 478 whatevers just with changing the cable out .
5 #### I got this head almost purely for looks . I am really used to using Evans EQ3 reso heads for bass drums , but they only come in black ( maybe white too ) , but not this nice faded color . I was worried about the sound being really different from the EQ3 , but really it is pretty similar . I keep minimum tension on it , and it sounds great . It might be slightly warmer than the EQ3 , but I actually like the tone . I feel like it matches the warmness of my low tuned toms . Oh , did I mention it looks great ? ! Only downside , but still not worthy of taking away a star , is that none of them come with a mic / port hole ! I wish I could buy it pre - cut ! Oh well , just bought a $ 15 hole cutter so I can do it whenever I want . Was really easy , do n't be scared ! But DO NOT try and just do it with an exact - o knife or something silly like that , get an actual hole cutter !
1 #### I bought two pairs of these headphones based on some of the reviews and I ca n't tell you how disappointed I am with this purchase . I 've been using the Sennheiser RX 100 headphones for the past few years and some of the reviewers compared the RP - HT21 to the RX 100 . The RP - HT21 are not even close to the RX 100 and for starters , they are very uncomfortable and slip off your ears easily and have very low volume . Overall , just a bit better than the headphones at the dollar store with a better bass .
5 #### I recommend it very good , fast and effective without delay are very efficient recommend 100 % Congratulations and many sale greetings and good luck Goodbye
5 #### Like the tote bags for my speaker stands and microphone stands , I got this more to show off than to believe I seriously needed it , but , as it turned out , I was thricely blessed for having bought it . I ended up using three microphones , two with the big global head and one for picking up an instrument 's sound . I dread the thought of putting them in my Gator sound rack and having them rattle around among the cables . In the future , I can foresee using more mikes , including headsets and wireless mikes . This should be large enough for all that , since the receivers for the wireless miles are velcroed to a shelf in my rack .
5 #### Best treatment available . I 've used it to clean injectors , quiet noisy lifters and generally tune up neglected engines . This is my go - to product for every car I work on .
4 #### Any sax player would know that 1/10 are actually playable reeds . But , the price is nice !
2 #### This case is not as good as the Seidio SURFACE Case for HTC DROID Incredible - Amethyst , which I also bought . It is made much more cheaply and was soon dirty after a week or normal use . Would n't buy again .
4 #### Good drum key . It does what its suppose to do . I m happy with this purchse
5 #### I had a bigger radio - never could them to work correctly - so I purchased this little radio and it works Awesome . I love it .
1 #### The first week I have to travel to another country and must have to change sims in each country . Also I bought an extras batteries to not have power problems due to gps and internet use . Due this must have to change bateries and sims cards so due the changing process the plastic part broke and have to buy another case .
4 #### I love the slim design , the color , and it functionality , however the battery life sucks after about a year and a half .
1 #### Still waiting on this product since I ordered it on January 1 2010 ( 3 - 5 days shipping )
5 #### Works great . Comfortable . And at the price , its actually a better buy , in my opinion , than the Lg tone . Tried the tone headset , and liked the feel of this one better . Pair 's easily . Great sound quality , and buds fit great . And , most importantly for me , lasts all day on a single charge ! Have had for about 2 months now , and love it .
4 #### I was very surprised at how much sound deadening one box of 24 one - foot squares provide . I had previously used 2 - inch thick sheets of bedfoam , and switched to these for cosmetic improvements . It took a LOT less of these to provide the same absorption as my other foam . The only reason I 'm not giving these 5 stars is because some of them were n't packed carefully and thus some of the pieces were bent / flattened . This is purely cosmetic , but cosmetics are important when these are hanging on the walls in your studio !
5 #### A bright beautiful sound . They take some getting used to if you are n't accustomed to using quality strings . But once you get the hang of them you 're set .
5 #### mounted one on each of my pickups to install 50 " LED light bars , Work fantastic and very solid .
5 #### Best picks ever , and a serious bargain compared to what Guitar Center sells them for .
5 #### Not a fan of the stick tips ( they are pretty tiny ) , but that is just personal preference ( I play VF 5A 's ) and I bought them for the mallets anyways . Mallet ends are great , not super dense but thick enough to be sturdy . Wish they were a tad cheaper but I knew what I was paying and what I was getting . Good purchase .
1 #### If you are buying this product for roof repairs save your money . It does not work . I went and bought regular tar repair tube at Home Depot and went over the sealed area again to stop my roof leak .
4 #### Great filter and the price is right . I 've been using this for years without any problems ... over 42 K on it now ...
4 #### These are a little small but they get the job done ... kind of wished I had purchased a larger pair ... nevertheless , they do work !
5 #### vino todo tal cual excelente producto lo mejor y funciona con cualquier equipo tactil supeeeer super lo mejor de lo mejor
4 #### Works good for the right pump , I use it all the time and have had no problems with it
5 #### I did n't want to wait weeks for the free iphone 4 case from Apple , so bought this one . When I got it , I loved how slim it is while still providing protection . It 's rigid enough to snap on securely , soft enough to feel good in hand and not slip , and open enough to allow me easy access to all buttons . The ONLY wierd thing is that the screen protectors that came with it do n't have the hole for the camera in quite the right place , so I manually trimmed it . But I love the case . Am giving my free case to my daughter !
3 #### Ordered in wrong size . Will keep and use it on other projects .
5 #### If you are looking for great ! headphones not just good ones , get these . When these ware out I , always buy these good price and affordable .
5 #### Bought this as part of my ' get home kit ' that I keep in my truck . Would definitely purchase again for a second ' get home ' kit .
5 #### This chair is a good size for our 2 year old with room to grow . The chair is adorable and I 've received a lot of compliments on it . It 's perfect for our home patio or packing in the trunk for traveling .
5 #### This product is light , easy to use and very comfortable . Before I bought this product , I did a research of my own and ask for suggestions . This item was recommended the most . I am happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and my family .
5 #### Vandoren reeds are second to none in my opinion . These arrived looking fresh and just like I d bought them from the music store .
3 #### This case seems that it would be very protective in a fall ( although I have not dropped my iPhone 3GS yet ) ! It is a bit bulky , however . Also , it is more rubbery silicone than smooth plastic , which means it 's tougher to get in and out of your pocket and it tends to pick up lint and dust . Basically , a rubbery silicone cover surrounds your phone . Then you put a partial - plastic cover on top of that . This smooth plastic " shell " covers about 40 % of the silcone , leaving 60 % of the rubbery , sticky stuff exposed . I liked the Seidio case for my 1st gen iPhone and may look into getting one of those for my 3GS .
4 #### This package came in a zip bag with the charger . Looks are simple and is not the best looker or classy . The performance is adequate . No one reported any echos or noise when I spoke to them . The volume at my end was pretty low with the earbud that came with it as it did not fit well in my ear being a little loose . Once I replaced that earbud with a bigger one that fitted well , the sound became better . The BT holds charge atleast for a while and I was able to get talktime of more than an hour . I would suggest anyone to get 2 - 3 of these at this price so they can keep one in the house , car and office . It connects pretty fast once its off the charger to your phone as long as your phone was in range the whole while . One grouse I have is that the bluetooth always defaults to 1/2 volume when disconnected and then reconnected to the phone and you need to increase the volume every time you reconnect . Also the on / off sounds are not loud enough and takes nearly 5 - 10 seconds to connect to phone once its fully disconnected . For $ 10 its a great value
5 #### Great way to add additional anchoring points to your pick - up . Installation only takes a few minutes , and they can be removed or relocated with no damage to the top of the pickup bed .
5 #### Love it but want the donkey version , no thanks to Donald , Ted , Jeb or Marco . Fabulous shape , feel , point , weight , flex , holdability , tone . Maybe the second fastest of all the picks I 've used ( after the Jazz Ultex III 's ) , you 're gon na love the control and how fast you forget where the point is .
4 #### Great headset for the money .... earpiece is a bit awkward to position on the ear , but good speaker and microphone audio .
5 #### Very well built stands for heavy duty applications . I used these for my GMC Topkick and they work perfect . Easy to lower when weight is off the stands . Thinking about buying 2 more
5 #### This item works really well and the battery last longer . I love it . I also like how it looks on my iPhone . Not bad for the price I paid .
5 #### This product takes time to put on right but it is worth the effort . When you are done you will not believe the results when you get into a rain storm . Your windshield glass is so slick that the heaviest rain just slides right off without using your wipers . Your visibility is improved dramatically and you can see what is going on around you . I use it often but especially when I am going on a long vacation drive . It improves your driving safety in inclement weather and helps to keep your family and you safer . I use it on the outside of all of my windows of my vehicles . It is good for rain , sleet and snow and even reduces the amount of bugs that will stick to your windows . The treatment lasts for about 3 months . It is only recommended for glass . The further you can see the better your response time to stop in case of an emergency . I strongly recommend this product as doing a great job !
5 #### This is exactly what i like and this is a very good product i really appreciated . thank you very much .
5 #### I 've had one of these up and running on PacBall DSL for 3 1/2 years now , serving two Macs and two PCs . One Mac is running OS X , one OS 8.6 , and the Windows boxes are running XP and 2000 . Early on we were having trouble staying connected , but the trouble was conflicting network protocols on a Win 98 box , now retired ; once the unnecessary protocols were removed , we stayed connected for weeks / months at a time . Check the company website for firmware updates every once in a while and Bob 's your uncle . My company ( a rather large tech - y enterprise ) adopted Linksys as the standard hub for areas without enough network ports , as they rarely have any problems with the Cisco backbone hardware . I would n't recommend anything else .
5 #### Arrived on time . Packed well . Did the job the way I wanted . Displays the DVD in a sturdy case .
4 #### These cables work very well . They are very soft to the feel , so I 'm hoping that wo n't shorten their life .
1 #### The 1 - star is to let everyone know that this fits Ford F-150 trucks with a manufacturer date BEFORE 12 - 05 - 2005 . It 's the 5/16 " version . If your truck was manufactured AFTER 12 - 05 - 2005 you will most likely need the 3/8 " version ( Motorcraft FG1083 ) . I had to return this and now I have to wait to do my filter change . Amazon should really fix this listing .
4 #### A subtle difference I found , but enough to achieve the sound I was looking for .
5 #### It works great & it charges my iPhone 5 fairly quickly . It 's small enough to fit in a pocket but still has enough power to charge a dead phone .
5 #### Sounds like the big old American cars from the 60 's and 70 's . Be careful how you ground them . If they sound weak , you probably wired the grounds wrong .
4 #### I recently recieved this item . The reception is about the same as my Grundig s350 . I took off 1 star because on fm I ca nt get 103 cleary but my grundig can get it better . Is it because the antena is too small ? Or is it that I need to modify it ? ? ? The am reception is good . The sound is better than the grundig s350 ! ! ! Over all the radio is good .
2 #### I do n't why these get all the good reviews , other inline controls work much better . The big problem is that zero on the control wheel is not . . . zero , there 's a substantial amount of volume coming through . Other than that , which is enough to relegate these to the junk drawer for me , this shares my complaints with the other controls , the wheel is too small and there 's insufficient tactile feedback for the finger to know which way is up or down , resulting in my ears getting blasted . Also , a previous set of Koss controls , not this design , had a similar cord connection that came apart .
5 #### just my personal favorite set of strings over GHS & Ernie Ball . used the regular XL 's on my previous Ibanez Roadster & cheapo Epiphone , loved the sound & feel , but broke a few strings due to the tremolos . Using these reinforced strings on my new Hagstrom Deuce F , so far , so good , great sounding as always .
3 #### Appeears to work well . Long battery life but the earpeice is uncomfortable after and hour or two .
5 #### These are getting hard to find . I use them occasionally when I want a bit of nostalgia to use my 80`s era 4 track recorder .
3 #### Listed as fitting a ' 91 Miata , but central frame is about a 1/4 " to wide to fit in the center console . Seems to fit most cars , but certainly not all .
1 #### Put a DVD in . Sprayed the cleaner . Worked like a charm . Put the second DVD in . Sprayed it . Began to spin the handle and the cleaning pad fell off the cleaning arm and scratched the heck out of my DVD . Returned it the same day I got it .
5 #### if you need to hang a guitar on the wall , then there 's no need to look further . good price , good quality , very straightforward product . we have 5 in our house .
5 #### Came with everything I needed , and was the best price for all included !
5 #### I bought this to hold my binder of guitar music on the table while I practice . It is very sturdy , works well , and I expect it to last for years . I would buy again .
5 #### I bought this item as a stocking stuffer for the husband . He typically keeps a pickholder on his pedal boards instead of having them all over or on the mic stand . It works as expected . I believe he put about 6 - 8 picks in there .
5 #### Arrived on time . Have n't used this yet , but looks very well made .
5 #### Sounds great out of the box . Great sustain , warm clean tone , as soon as I put these on . Stretching was not too bad , and I was amazed by how much better my guitar sounded .
5 #### The Wolo chirping back up alarm works almost to well ! It strats chirping when you start to back up and if someone is behind your vehicle , they stop and look for the ' chirping ' bird ! So you have to wait till they realize that it 's a back up alarm and not somebody 's pet ! Too funny !
3 #### Works good at the beginning But you will stop using it you wo n't be able to see everything through your windows
5 #### Great back - up tapes for those of us who still have VCR 's . I have a combo machine and transfer back and forth from DVD 's , I record to the tapes and back again .
5 #### With no standard size definition for cup holders or electronic devices - this adjustable cup holder works perfectly . It 's built very well , and the fact that it 's not bulky is a plus . I have an FJ Cruiser . Putting a windshield or dash holder is not an option . Using the uphold is the only way to have my devices visible , yet not obstructing my view or dangerously falling off into the foot well while driving ( had that happen one too many times with other holders ) . After installing the device into the upholder ( I love how it adjust to fit various sized cup holders ) , I have n't had to readjust any of the settings . Everything stays in place even after continued use . It 's easy to my phone in and out of the holder . I got one for my close friend and they love it too . Phones down the best holder I have purchased ( I 've tried all the major brands , different styles and placements over the years and this one by far wins them out ) .
5 #### This did not work for my T - MOBILE NETWORK So I bought " Nextivity Cel - Fi RS2 Cell Phone Signal Booster for T - Mobile Only " and this works great just have to Google research about products that will work with your network and read product reviews
5 #### I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this flash . The only con I really have with it is the plastic foot . I can see how it could easily break . That combined with the cheep hot shoe cord I bought , I am always VERY careful when I use it . I 've just now ( today actaully .. the light bulb just kind of went off ) started to understand it more and get comfortable using it and the timing could n't be more perfect . I 'm using it this coming weekend at a wedding I 'm shooting , so we 'll see how it goes !
5 #### Though I do n't use it all that much anymore , this is an excellent pedal . Besides the 3 band EQ and distortion settings , this preamp really has alot of room to beef up your bass , Get a power supply for it though as it is a battery killer . The XLR output is also a cool feature .
4 #### Installed on a 2007 Lincoln MKZ with no issues , fit was spot on . Installing this wiper blade assembly took me about 5 minutes from opening the box , installing , and putting old parts into the garbage . Time will tell on the squeegee quality , winter just starting here in the Chicagoland area .
4 #### I use it on the drawbar on my tractor . I have an assortment of trailers and different size hitch balls . Makes it quick to change out . I do n't think I would trust this at highway speeds .
5 #### The best iPhone charger ever . I rarely emote about a product , but this thing takes the cake ! The design & functionality - superb . A must for international travelers and heavy data users . Six stars if that was an option .
2 #### i am an IT Eng . i connected Bixolon SRP770II USB label printer in a restaurant . there is no tolerance in such environments especially at rush hours . i tested it for 2 week ..... IT IS NOT RELIABLE , some times it just stuck you have to rest it ... then it starts to print all the old orders ! ! ! that happened many times .
5 #### Good old brake cleaner from 3 M cleans up really good without residue would recommend for any brake job have a great day everyone
4 #### Great lens -- it lives up to the Canon " L " lens hype . .The image stabilization feature on the 24 - 105 allows you to shoot photos at a slower shutter speed in dark situations since the fastest this lens goes is F4 . The IS feature is really amazing and incredibly useful for shooting video . Adobe Lightroom helps fix some of the distortion on the wide end . The extras included in this package are okay but should not be the deciding factor in getting the lens . The bonus Digital Ultraviolet HD UV filter I received seemed really low - quality in terms of construction as I was never able to mount it on the lens since I was afraid to damage the threads on the lens .
4 #### Nice texture . They do n't slip when your fingers get damp from sweat . A little more texture would be even better .
5 #### I 've been using this cable for a laser printer for about 8 months . It is a very high quality cable for it 's price point . Very solid . It works flawlessly .
5 #### Nothing fancy here . Followed the instructions and I ended up with a K&N filter that looked brand new . Think the squeeze bottle of oil allows for better control . The oil wicks into the folds of the filter quite nicely . Not as messy as the spray oil . Best price I could find on it . Think I will get about 4 cleanings and oiling of my filter for a 2000 Silverado 1500 .
5 #### Upon the recommendation of other players , I have been using these on my ES-335 for a couple years now and am very happy with the tone of these strings . I typically change strings at least once per month , but the tone seems fairly consistent during that time . As long as they keep making them , I will keep buying them .
5 #### I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I did n't have to . The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me ! So it 's like that guy who asks for a lighter ... uses it ... and puts it in his pocket every single time , these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter . I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers . It 's a decent tool at a good price so buy one ... Then see how long you can own it !
5 #### These strings are fantastic ! Somebody had given me a set of these strings for my guitar awhile back and I had never used them before . I 've always used just standard D'Addario strings and I do n't change strings very frequently unless they get really corroded or they break . Finally I put a set of these on and it changed the sound of my guitar completely , and definitely for the better . It was a much deeper and more full sound . These strings are fantastic ! They also last much longer than the D'Addarios I used to use . So , I got a set for my wife 's guitar and she absolutely loves them too . I definitely recommend these to anybody looking for some acoustic guitar strings .
4 #### In a nutshell : - Easy to use right out of the box . - Touch screen is a blessing . The thumbwheel on the StreetPilots was fine , but the touch screen on these Nuvi 's is much faster . - Even this entry - level unit has a great database of points of interest . - Excellent volume . Very loud . - Very compact . Very portable . - If you have vision issues , opt for a model with a larger screen . - It would be nice if they supplied a carrying case . You might want to purchase a small , hard - cover case for it . -
4 #### It accommodates my iPhone 4S with case ( Vapor Pro by Element Case ) very well . I hope it had better design though .
1 #### I bought this for a 2005 Jeep Wrangler , although it is listed as the correct plug it is not . I ended up getting a Scosche adapter and it had the ends pictured here as well as the right connections for my Jeep .
5 #### Funny how Apple can not afford to include the tool necessary to open the SIM tray ! ! ! Well , if you purchased an iPhone and find that you need to open the SIM tray , you can either try to bend a paperclip and try to get it in straight , or you can order this tool . Personally , I found this tool to work much better ! I was a bit surprised to find that three tools were included in the shipment instead of the one described . So , I am more than pleased with this order . The tool works great and because of the shape , it goes in straight and opens the tray with ease . Having three of them makes it less likely to lose the tool . This way I can keep one at home with the paperwork , take one on trips overseas ( cheaper to buy prepaid chips at the airports ) and have one more put away . The tool arrived on time and it works great ! ! I would highly recommend the tool and the vendor .
5 #### This is a Strong Reliable capo , holds up to many years of abuse . I recommend to any guitar player !
5 #### its a cord and i use it for all my ipod/ iphone needs it works well and the price is right to .
5 #### Sounds go in one end , and come out the other . Exactly what I need .
1 #### there was no user guide and the phone looked like it was used . Did n't expect it to be that big and with very crappy ring tones .
4 #### This replaced my old cord that stopped working due to no strain relief on the cord supplied by the manufacturer . It is the same but still has the too short flaw that the orgional one had .
5 #### you have to recharge your filter yearly or sooner my lawn mower has k and n filter i put that s * * * in everything
5 #### Easy to focus , easy to adjust , sharp image edge - to - edge . These little folders are a gem -- and a little more forgiving when it comes to eye relief ( you do n't have to be as ultra - precise about how far you hold them from your eyes as other miniature binoculars require ) . Image clarity is better than any other miniature binoculars I 've owned ( close to a dozen pair at this point ) , including some that retail for 2x-3x this price . Ca n't speak to their ruggedness yet but so far I 'm very pleased .
5 #### Using this product with the 3 M polish and synthetic wax left a professional looking finish . It was easy to put on .
5 #### one of the best i 've seen . sturdy enough although it got a nick when i had to take it off once to put on a screen protector but it 's still good . graphics are great and love the extra protection on the bottom front . thicker than others i 've bought . if you like the design , do n't hesitate - just buy it .
5 #### As ususal , Meguiar 's delivers great quality . We polished a boat we purchased that had some neglect on the gel coat . We used their oxidation cleaner first to remove the worst of the gunk , but this polished out the swirl marks and left a great surface to apply wax to . We used a DeWalt buffer with a green foam buffing pad . I will mention , that if you 're working as a team to polish something , the polisher should wait for the buffer to catch up because we got too far apart on timing and the polish was difficult to remove , but that was our fault . Just try to get it off as soon as it hazes .
5 #### Works fantastic . I use it for my Hornady AP Press .
4 #### This is large and well - made , but a bit too heavy for my purposes .
4 #### It works very well but it has so many pieces that I needed a case for it so I sold it and bought the exact same one but with a travel case .
5 #### I gave it as a gift and still have not hear any complaints .
5 #### I have n't used this much but i definitely will . We occasionally have storms and downed wires , blown transformers . I have to keep backup lighting handy . This was smaller than I expected , but does give a good amount of light . It 's easy to find the " on " button . I keep it by me at night for emergencies . It was definitely worth buying . 3/27/15 - it still works . I 've used it for emergencies and as a flashlight in the house and on night walks . It still charges good and is a bright light .
5 #### This item was well made as one would expect . Performed well . Used to connect ethernet switch box to computer modem . This in turn connected my computer and several online entertainment consoles . Did the job .
5 #### This thing grips well , is easy to move up and down the fretboard , and leaves no buzz in the strings . Best capo I have ever owned and seems like it will last a lifetime .
3 #### These hold pretty well once they are cinched down but but there is no ratchet to them . You pull the webbing through and then lock them down but it takes a little practice to get them properly tightened without a ratchet feature . Also the " protection pad " behind buckle to protect the boat is just another piece of webbing and not really a pad and it is tough to align directly behind the buckle sometimes . Once you get them aligned and tightened properly they do work and hold well .
5 #### These are well built with good quality jacketed cables , solid connectors that fit well and good strain relief where the cable entes the connector shell . Quiet , with no hum or other noises as the cable is moved around .
5 #### I use this lens with my rebel 300 and have had no problems . I read the other reviews and took their advice on changing f stop and everything has worked great . I have taken shots of hawks on the fly and the shots have come out very clear . When I save up some money maybe I 'll buy a IS lens but right now this works just fine .
5 #### This cleaner wax / polymer is a great first step for vehicles with paint only . It shines and cleans nicely . I do it by hand , so it is some work . The benefits are gleaming .
4 #### Nice metronome but not the easiest to use I have ever had . The markings make it a bit hard to read in low light , but it is a decent performer , small , compact and easy to slip into an accessories pouch in an instrument case . Travels well and seems to be fairly rugged , but higher contrast markings would be a lot nicer .
1 #### I needed a 6s it states that it fits a 6s . It was way to small . Not useable .
5 #### I bought this to practice playing my Les Paul with my Fender amp . This cable snaps in both ends perfectly and the sound is pretty good . Great quality for the price . I considered other lengths but I 'm so glad I went with 10 foot , which is perfect for practicing on my own . Anything shorter would almost require me to have the amp close to me on the right at all times and anything longer would have too much slack .
2 #### Very light and kind of flimsy . It keeps my cell phone and remote organized next to my bed , but you ca n't run the charge wire through is as if you pick up the phone the whole station comes with it .
5 #### I must have to check the gap on the spark plug before installing them . I double check even new ones to make sure .
5 #### again and again i find stuff on amazon for far cheaper then in store . We have best buy where i live and have to go there for parts . They are so overpriced that i have stopped going there and am more then happy to wait for belivery . I am a pc gamer and play on a 55 " in my living room . I had been using wireless keyboards but they always were haveing range or interference problems so i bought this cord . More then enuff length for me to use my keyboard anywhere in my living room .
5 #### Highly recommend for any automatic transmission , even if it runs smooth , this will protect it for longer life .
1 #### Did not fit my application and to be honest was too complicated to install . Wo n't buy again .
2 #### Very sturdy picks but also very hard to hold on to as the surface of these picks have no grip at all .
3 #### This is a great phone in terms of reception . There are some design flaws . If carrying the phone in a bag , it is easy to inadvertently hit the record button or to lower the sound of the ringer . There are limited ringers that come with the phone and it is difficult if not impossible to download ringers without buying Verizon 's Get It Now package or hacking into the phone . The camera is USELESS for indoor shots . The Bluetooth feature is only useful for a headset . Verizon has made it impossible to sync it with your computer . It is a nice looking phone if a bit long . The keyboard is odd . You can list multiple numbers for each entry , and that 's a plus .
5 #### I purchased my Jabra at an AT&T store and paid twice as much as I did for my fiancee 's and they are just alike . This is the best hands free speaker phone that I could find . My aunt purchased the Blue Ant because it was less expensive and found later that you ca n't use it through you car stereo . She wishes that she had bought this brand now . I recommend the Jabra for anyone in the market for a hands free car set .
5 #### Great product ! Fast shipping ! I would buy again : )
5 #### Good quality and installs in minutes . Fit our application well and looks good .
3 #### These work great for as long as they last . The transmitter that plugs into the computer USB port always fails after 1 1/2 to 2 years of service . If they lasted longer , I would have given it a five star rating . I 've had three of these things over the years because they are so comfortable and ergonomic . Wish Logitech would sell replacement transmitters so I did n't have to buy a complete new product every two years .
1 #### Manual seems very cheap . The book is very generic to most common problems . The electrical diagrams are helpful for diagnosing . As far as troubleshooting most mechanical problems , this manual wo n't help .
5 #### Martin strings are of the highest quality . They seem to last longer which is a benefit if you hate changing 12 strings . They are bright and responsive . The price is very reasonable .
5 #### Not bad for the price . True they are not as good as my $ 150 binoculars , but they are a lot smaller and easier to take with you . However , they are optically coated and have a decent image , especially considering what I paid for them .
5 #### Awesome strings ! I 've been using this brand for years ... And they really do last a long time , you can wear them out and they still sound great ..
4 #### These have a freq response of 20 - 20000KHz listed in the box , not 16 - 23000 like the product description page . Still , they 're $ 10 . Good enough , and better than the crap headphones that come with phones and media players .
4 #### I feel like there was n't enough in the can for its weight , like they had n't filled it up with enough compressed air or something . There was still fluid in the can when it went " empty " .
5 #### Perfect description of product ; fast shipping product met all expectations !
4 #### Well not alot to say on this . I bought this to connect my Roku box to my router since they are only about 2 feet apart . Its thin and not the best quality , but it works great . Snagless means that the ends are protected from being snapped off while feeding the cord through holes or openings in your desk or entertainment center . IT WORKS ... and well that s what matters most . So my opinion , to run an ethernet cord to a short distance , you ca n't get a better value .
4 #### This meter seems to do what it claims . Its really very interesting to move it around in rooms and near electrical devices and outlets to see what readings you get . We have a lot of computer and electronic devices in our home and I feel better getting some idea of which devices and areas have the most energy . I was blissfully unaware of the levels of EMF and this meter certainly fixes that . I would have rated it 5 stars if there was a " hold button " that you press at the highest reading mark so that you can read the level after it was taken . Even better would an automatic highest reading indicator that you could clear for each type of energy scan . Nonetheless I like the meters flexibility in being able to scan electric and magnetic energy readings and I do recommend it .
5 #### Recomiendo que antes de leer este libro , se lean primero Africanus el hijo del Consul , que son parte de una triloga que termina con La traicin de Roma . Excelentes los tres libros y la historia de las legiones malditas que luego de ser desterradas , logran volver a Roma . Los recomiendo .
5 #### I just got the headset today . I am very pleased with the quality . The bass is surprisingly good ! am always on the hunt for items that I can use by myself because I have several disabilities . I could not put them on without help , but this has nothing to do with the performance of the headset ! With this headset being so comfortable , I will have no discomfort if I fall asleep watching TV . I added my HonShoop .dongle , and turned the headset into a Blu - tooth headset ! The call and answering is very clear . Like others have said , you get a good product for a good price . I hope the price does n't increase . UPDATE ; I had trouble getting them on , I was putting them on backwards ! So now that I got the right and left correct , I can slide them on like eye glasses and stand them up . I wore them all day yesterday and night , no pain ! : )
5 #### This is a great armband . The strap is nice and wide and offers good support for the iphone . The phone cover is great , too . It offers good protect for the phone .
5 #### My camper did not have a stud where the handle mounts so I had to go all the way thru the wall and reinforce it . But the handle is really nice and has made getting in and out of the camper a lot safer .
5 #### Works great ! I use them to connect to my video converters then to my new ATEM TV studio for broadcasting on the internet .
5 #### The product worked fine , but it was very difficult to find a location where the inside antenna did n't " see " the external one . Needed to use a 18 feet mast to get excelent results
5 #### Sleek and lightweight at 6.2lbs or 2.7 kg . Quality construct of durable waterproof outer reinforced nylon and robust contoured foam lined in lush blue velvet . Handling - Comes with ( 1 ) a pair of robust rubberised ergonomic handles that soft - click together like a jigsaw for secure handling and ( 2 ) robust shoulder strap . My YAS62 sits snugly and securely inside three blue velvet lined contoured compartments . Velcro straps secure the crook and mpc snugly in their grooves . Generous velcro flap secure the two halves of the case beneath the carry handles to provide double protection over and above double zippers that hold the case shut . External Storage - on both sides are side compartments for keeping cleaning cloths and accessories , even a compact foldable saxophone stand . One of the compartments have internal holding slots for passport/ wallet/ 3pencil holders . A great transport solution at an affordable price $ 130-$140 . Got mine from a secondary purchase and can not be happier . Thank you !
5 #### This serial cable worked great for my ham radio application . I had another one and it did n't work for some reason . You ca n't beat this for the price and very sturdy construction .
3 #### I am sure the disks will perform as most 3.5"-ers do . Case was cracked . I do n't think Amazon put any packing material to keep it from banging aroudn the box . Disk 's case was cracked .
5 #### I add 1 ounce to a gallon of diesel fuel in my tractor to reduce smoking . Good product .
5 #### I have pretty much used this reso head exclusively for the 20 years I have been drumming . The G1 reso G2 coated batter combo is my go to . Ido not neglect your reso heads , they are important for a good sounding set .
2 #### First pair I bought got stolen outta my car , somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it :( Anyway , first pair sounded great . I bought another pair , there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency . This made me extremely annoyed / angry / disappointed . I can not stand bad crap , and I hate to give bad product reviews . But I had to send it back and now I will look for a different company brand , probably for the rest of my life .
5 #### The case exceeded my expectations . The fit was perfect with all controls accessible and the texture provides a sure grip .
3 #### Works ok , no more than enough so use it and throw it away .
5 #### Good strings . I have since changed over to original bullets ( pure nickel ) These have a nice tone , and seem to last a while .
4 #### these seem more pliable and a little deeper so the entire connector is protected better thaan the OE that came with my truck
1 #### Waste of MONEY . Does nothing to improve signal . Do n't fall for this scam like I did ! ! ! !
5 #### Re - ordered these recently . They hold up better than the cheaper brands . No failures yet . No interference from computers and other equipment . Good guitar cables for the price .
5 #### Works great , great price . These are getting hard to find , glad I found them here .
5 #### This was exactly the part I needed to help wire my dashcam to my fuse box in my truck ( along with a " Add - a - Circuit " splitter ) . The short cable was fine for me as I tucked this behind my dash out of sight . The lip on mine was metallic as others have mentioned , but that 's the ground connection so no biggie .
5 #### I had been using a Linksys router for a few years before buying this switch . Then I changed to a new DSL provider ( Frontiernet ) whose modem is also a router , so I picked up this switch to split my connection to various computers in my home ( having two routers on Frontiernet caused problems with TCP port forwarding ) . First , I was surprised by the compact size of the switch . I hooked it up and it was good to go - a slick connection and no messing around . It is a perfect companion to the Speedstream 5200 DSL modem , and probably many others .
4 #### Best bass strings . fat wounds are great , i cheated , fender strings on an epiphone .. shh do not tell . they still work great .
3 #### Should have went with the longer one , If your getting this to cover your ass end , get the wider one . For the money the cr 600 will do just fine for the jeep with 3 " lift .
5 #### These look great . Do n't over torque -- well you should n't anyway . But they look fabulous and the plastic washer will prevent you from scratching up your rack .
4 #### needed louder horns for my boyfriends land cruiser . got these . while not as nice as early land cruiser horns , they are loud and do n't sound like a dorky little rice car horn
4 #### This items was a gift for my 19 year old who is a new driver . She thought it would be a little cheezy to have one but now she loves it . She was sold by the color and convenience . I wanted her to be safe !
5 #### Needed a replacement for a Tascam foot switch for the old 488 tape recorders . This one fit the bill , works perfectly .
4 #### Works as advertised ! READ the included instructions before first use to ensure you are satisfied with the results .
4 #### Nice strap locks but when you hook your strap to your guitar , make sure you give it a little tug to make sure its secure because a few times I thought it was locked and it slipped right out as I let the guitar rest with the strap . Any guitarist knows that a simple miss like that can end any very expensive guitars life if it falls just right .
5 #### I used it to wire up a car I was towing home . The wires were long enough to reach from the towing vehicle all the way back to the taillights of the disabled car .
5 #### Nice headphones - sound is as good as my 99.00 headphones . The only drawback is the headband is a bit tight on my big head . Maybe they 'll loosen up a bit overtime . Not hugely uncomfortable - just a bit snug . I think I 'll get used to them . If you have an " average " size head I think they will be fine
5 #### These just are what they are . They attached flawlessly to my american standard stratocaster . They have worked well since . Pick em up .
3 #### This product was advertised as a " factory unlocked " iPhone . Since the only factory who can unlock the phone is Apple , I assumed I would be getting a genuinely Apple authorized unlocked iPhone . Ah , this is not the case . The phone is brand - new , but immediately upon opening the package , there is a notice from the seller stating that this is a " jailbroken " phone . It is unclear to me who did the " unlock " but it clearly was n't Apple because jailbreaking voids the warranty on US sold phones . I 'm going to keep the phone because it will do what I need , which is to serve as a Europhone when I travel and I can drop in my various European sim cards . So , in the end , I got what I needed , but it surely is n't what I expected .
3 #### Just like OEM . After a few weeks though they have started skipping on my windshield making an annoying sound . I hope it is a fluke .
4 #### My first order for this battery was from an Amazon affiliate . The battery that came , did n't look exactly like the original from my Z6 , but it had the Moto hologram . I do n't think it was that great . So when my wife 's Moto needed a new one , I spent more to get it from Amazon directly and this one looks like the original and seems to work better .
4 #### These are good strings , but not sure if they matched my Yamaha FG700S , and are starting to lose their luster a little early .
5 #### Works well on a 2006 Toyota 4 Runner . The previous replacement wipers I purchased were terrible .
3 #### Its a nice adapter but be aware flip down / removeable face radios will not work properly . The face will get stuck 1/4 way down(not far enough to insert a CD ) I have an Alpine mounted in it currently .
5 #### These are really long , and they work . What else is there to say ?
5 #### This stand was and still is useful to me after several years . Fits all versions of Iphones since my 3 G , now even the iphone 6Plus ( I usually put it horizontally ) . You can adjust the angle at whuch you are facing the screen , by using / extendingbthe center piece on the back . You can also spread the lower ends to hold a smaller / bigger smart phones . Convenient to watch movies or just keep your phone upright on your work desk . Easy for transportation in a briefcase as you just unhook the lower ends and place on any flat surface .
5 #### I purchased this from Dealdady seller . Battery arrived in sealed bag inside of an envelope . Definitely a brand new battery NOT a used replacement like these other sellers . Arrived partially charged . After a full first battery cycle , it has lasted for a week straight before next charging . I would recommend and buy these again if needed .
5 #### item works great and is not slow with 8 computer running at one time , I use it in my tv n computer repair shops
4 #### Does its job in reducing 1/2 tank acme fitting to a 1/4 hose fitting .
1 #### Upon receiving Shop Fox D2811 Wheel marking gauge , the end screw was a loose fit ( would fall out ) . The internal threads were not tapped deep enough . The internal dimension of the scribing disk on the end is also sloppy . Overall , this looked like it came from China .... very poor quality ... would not suggest .
5 #### I gave this product 5 stars because it is the best I have found . In other reviews there are complaints of it coming off a belt , if you do as other reviewers have said you wo n't have any problem . Just weave the bottom of the clip on top of the 3rd strap . The clip is strong and made of metal . If you want to use it horizontally you can thread your belt thru the fabric straps . This holster will not keep your phone clean as the top is open but that is good if you want to plug in earphones . The inside is of a soft material to protect the screen . Construction is heavy duty and should last a long time . The only negative I could mention is that the strap locking clip ( sort of like luggage clips but heavier ) I found hard to align to lock it . This is because not only is there the two snap out clips but a third center locator prong . This was square ended and a fairly tight fit into the grove . Sometimes I struggled to get it started . It really is n't a problem once you realize the issue and do what I did . I took a fine file and rounded the corners on the center prong , no more trouble ! ! After looking at bulky holsters , ones with plastic clips that break and ones that would n't accommodate the phone with a decent case I was happy to find this holster . I recommend ! !
5 #### These are my go - to drum sticks . The wooden acorn tips tend to flake and are n't as durable as the nylon tip , but I find they are great for smaller venues when you want to play a little more quietly .
5 #### Pros : Quiets even the noisest mufflers . Great for audio response . Keeps bass sound where it belongs ... in your ears . Gives a luxury car sound inside , will keeping the loud , obnoxious high performance sound on the outside of your car . I love my cars to be loud and rowdy , but want to drive in peace . Cons : Price . Overall : Buy it . It flat works . I have tried Lizard Skin , Hushmat , and others , but this is the best stuff . I build Hot Rods , and all the best builders use this stuff . You will too if you want the best . I even used it on my dishwasher to keep it ultra quiet . Much better than spending another $ 400 to get the " quiet " dishwasher .
5 #### One of our neighbors , who has way too many cars , recommended this to my husband . It works really well ! It dries the car quickly and is really easy to wring out . No more slimy chamois !
4 #### Good sound , good options . A bit larger than you might think from the picture . Sound is good , as is reception . I have it on the back corner of the desk as background music .
4 #### These are nice metal file organizers that are painted black . After time , the paint may chip / peel but right now they look good .
5 #### love the raspberry pi . great little computer to play around on . every kid should have to learn the basics on one of these . sellers on amazon are making a profit on these - which is fine , its a free market ! but if you 're on a budget , and $ 10 makes a difference , you can find these for $ 35 if you look around . this thing is great to teach kids things like visual basic , install linux and experience a open source operating system . you can also play with IO via the GPIO pins , and light LED 's or things like that . even if you are a perent that knows not about computers , you should buy this thing for your kid , and spend the weekend playing with it , seeing what you can do . there are endless resources online that will teach you to do everything with this from making a security cam to a NES emulator . every kid should be taught to program ! have fun
5 #### This kit had all the parts needed , nothing was missing and the pump is working great , the engine is running at the optimum temperature and all is well ! We are back to boating in the beautiful Northwest !
2 #### I was very dissapointed with its audio performance . I do n't want to write a lot because others have definitely written the positive features in good detail(good microphone , quick connect , good battery life , light - weight etc . ) , but the usability is very restricted . Here is the bottom line , if you want to take this unit outside of your office / home / any quiet environment , you will NOT be able to hear the other person even if the environment is moderately noisy ( this is at unit 's highest volume ) . I was using this in the car , and I can hear faint at best when the road is good , but when you pass through slightly patchy freeway , the other person 's voice is completely drowned . The speaker 's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable . By the way , this experience was inside a luxury car , not a cardboard car . I am not sure the reason behind this design , could be to improve battery life ? I had high expectations . I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 ( read good reviews about it : in - ear position & USB charging ) . By the way , I used this with my Blackberry 7100 g , good syncing and quick connection .
5 #### Very fine , brand - new " ribbed " Keyser Guitar Capo . Great customer service and fair price !
5 #### Very nice product , seems to be made with good quality . Good price too
5 #### They last longer than any other strings that I have tried , and they really bring out the nice tones of my Martin guitar .
5 #### Awesome . Just used this for the first time earlier today . I 've owned a natural chamois but have n't used it in years so I threw it away . This works great . Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it ( def another recommended product ) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces . Soaks the water up very well , rings out a lot of the water and stores " damp " which means little to not maintenance to maintain . Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was .
5 #### Worked great in my 2004 Jeep GC ( not infinity - but it has amp turn on wire if yours is Infinity ) . Metra is always good quality .
5 #### I 've used this stuff for a while now , on various car / truck pars and it really works . Have to prep well , and apply right , but when you do , this stuff will last . Powerful rust prevention coating .
4 #### Works okay and very good quality . I purchased two of these for use in my utility trailer . It is a bit difficult to find the correct ' sweet spot ' of tension , but they should work good to keep most cargo from moving around .
5 #### Good tone , Last better than a lot of other strings .I use these on all my solid body guitars .
4 #### I use these cables with my POD HD 500 as direct out to my PA at home . Did n't like the rolled up look of the stage cables . Sounds good and out of the way .
2 #### Tried installing these on a Gibson SG . The screws that come with the straplock are longer and/or thicker than the standard ones on the SG . Therefore , I did not want to force the dunlop screws into the guitar . The SG screws do not work with these because the heads are too big . In essence , these did not work for me .
5 #### This little MicroSD is perfect for my Galaxy S4 with all of the bloatware . I would recommend this product to anyone who has a Galaxy phone .. SO MUCH SPACE
5 #### Fast shipping Works well enough , has lines in the screen but does the job compared to my old broken screen
5 #### Ernie Ball always has quality products . The generous length is great for tall players . A well made and inexpensive guitar strap . I prefer these on acoustic guitars . They work fine on electric guitars . Bass players will need a wider strap . Lightweight and available in many colors .
5 #### I read a book purely for entertainment . I can live with a few grammatical errors . This book was full of twists and turns and shocks and surprises that I almost did n't go to work when I was supposed to . I was at the point where I really hated to put it down . One thing I really appreciated about this book , unlike many I have started and discarded , is a person really gets to know the character before being introduced to more . This alleviates a lot of confusion . There are some books that have too many unimportant characters that I 've had to go back a few pages just to try and figure out who they are talking about and what their importance is . Not this book . All the characters play an important role . Also , there were n't a lot of wasted pages describing unimportant things that really have no bearing on the plot . Too many books will waste pages describing in detail a sex scene or history from a past life that has nothing to do with the story . Yep , this is one of my more enjoyable books that I 've read .
5 #### This is my brand of choice . I use them on my Taylor acoustic and the sound is just better than some of the others I 've tried ( brighter / crisper ) . I 've tried Martin 's on it as well and while they worked out fine , I felt it was worth the extra couple bucks to get these .
2 #### I bought these to knock out some of the noise from a busy 35 mph street I walk next to for my walking commute . I carefully squished the pads and let them expand in my ears forming a fairly high pressure seal . They maybe take a couple Db off the road noise , barely taking the edge off . I can drop down the volume a notch or two from where I would with my other open air Koss headphones . But that is more because there is a tube shooting the music into your ears . Sound is not up to my other cheap Koss headphones . And the wires could literally not be any thinner or more delicate . I bought these Koss because I like my other cheap Koss " over - ear - clip open - air " headphones so much and the cord was nice and beefy on those . I tried someones suggestion of replacing the pads with official ear plugs , trimmed to length and a hole punched through . That helped a tiny bit more . Noise leak seems to be right through the headphone itself . If you try to replace the pads , I suggest , scissors , a heated ice pick , pointy chopsticks , and lots of patience .
5 #### This cymbal holder is excellent if you 're on gigs and need to set up and break down fast . Also its rock steady once set in place . Allows the cymbal to swing freely . It does take a slight learning curve if you 're a heavy hitter . The yellow spring is perfect for Ride cymbals and chinas . The red spring is perfect for crashes and splashes . Also these springs prevent cymbals from keyholing , which will completely destroy the cymbal sound . Make the investment and protect your cymbals and your sound .
4 #### Works great . Length is avg and quality seems nice , although a little thinner feel than my other " name brand , high quality " cable . Would purchase again and possibly get longer length if offered .
1 #### Disappointed . Did not push the grease through bearings , so pretty useless .
5 #### This stuff is awesome . Fuel gauge on my 2005 Ford Explorer was malfunctioning . Manufacturer suggested it was from sulfur build - up inside the tank from cheap fuel . Followed the directions and if fixed the problem . I now use it in all my gas - powered tools ( chain saws , wood splitter , lawn mower , hedge trimmer ) and dirt bikes when they 've sat a while and might have some residue build - up in the carburetors . Love it .
5 #### I ordered the Pearl PAB50 Ash Tone Woodblock for my Yamaha electronic drum kit , and found this was a must - have for mounting it . Really a nice piece of hardware -- solid , adaptable to any angle .
3 #### To be honest I 'm not very impressed by these , they are and feel cheap . I'l get more expensive strings next time and go back to Medium since these are too bright for my taste
5 #### I have n't really used this yet i tested it here in my office on my rebel XS it seemed to work really well . I was presently surprised at how compact this unit is , i am really looking forward to using it
4 #### Grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard . Feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand , but I guess that 's how all of them are . Works very well on acoustic guitars
5 #### BUy this if you want to extend to extend your fire wire drive beyond the length of the little short cord provided .
5 #### It 's an excellent equipment for the price . I put the chip of my country ( Ecuador ) and It works very well
3 #### This phone is probably great however I never got it so I do n't know . I ordered it through Amazon over a month ago . Why do they still claim that it will ship in 2 weeks ?
5 #### Works well , be carefull if you have a small scope it might not work , I bought this barlow when I had a 70 mm refractor but could not get it to focus on anything until I got a much larger telescope ( 10 " dobsonian ) I have n't done my research to know why but if you own a Celestron TravelScope or another small telescope you might be better off with a 2X instead of 3X Barlow . I am not an expert on optics but I have not seen any degradation on the image while using this barlow . I would recomend it . Good value for the price !
5 #### This thing is great . Not only does it pronounce my name right , which is rare even for humans , it still telling me " battery level is high " since I unplugged it after four days . Granted , I have yet to actually " use " it .
5 #### The igo products are very reasonably priced and versatile . Once you have the base charger all you have to do is replace the tip for your particular needs .
4 #### Good price perfect fit very Fast ship a must to replace OEM oil filters on a Yamaha R6 . The only way they could make this filter better would be to add a wrench off bolt to the top and I 'd buy 10 so I d never have to worry about a filter again .
4 #### Our drummers love these headphones - but they hold up for about 5 months before the jack breaks and they only produce sound in one ear .
3 #### Bought these for me to try since my " tecki " son asked for these for himself . I 've got little ears and find these extremely uncomfortable . I shoot shotguns , so I know how to use foam ear plugs but these are just too big for me . I 'll probably give them to my husband who has big old ears . Most other ear buds I 've bought include three sizes of ear cushions , these have only two .... big and bigger . The sound quality is heavy on bass with no treble . I do n't know squat about ohms and hz or other sound lingo but I do know what I like to hear in my music and these just do n't cut it for me . I usually do n't pay more than $ 20 for ear buds because the right ear sound always quits after awhile . Even the Bose had this problem after 18 months . These looks like they are well made and I do like the fact that there 's a flex joint at both the ear buds and the plug - in .
4 #### Decent Winder . I 'm kind of new at changing strings , so I may not be the best to review this kind of thing . It cut string well and pulled on the Bridge Pegs well , so it worked fine for me . I would buy one for my mother , so I guess this would be a solid 4 star product ! .
5 #### I was about to buy a new guitar . My Yamaha sounded terrible with the old strings on and thinking , the guitar was hopeless .. After replacing with this string , the guitar is playable again .
5 #### I was surprised at how much better my bike ran after cleaning the air filter . I have an S&S Super G carb . The filter was full of old engine oil that comes in from the cylinder head vents . The oil really cuts down the air flow . Cleaning the filter makes a significant difference in the engine performance .
5 #### These strings are incredible ! They last for months with daily use without losing their crisp tone . They last so much longer than my old strings ( Martin Marquis ) that they are definitely worth the price .
4 #### Sound fine , look like crap , feel like crap . I purchased because these are reviewed as having better sound , but I should have gone with better headphones in general . I am not a fan of using these for extended amounts of time .
5 #### Great mount used it on my " 32 TV and not I can swing it in between two rooms
5 #### These are some of the better 7 string sets out there . Misha Mansoor from periphery also uses these . I like the .59 7th string ; is n't too thick and holds tune well . They do n't die or rust out quick either .
5 #### ghreat guitar sounded great great and had great great action
5 #### Great lights , plenty bright to light up off road areas . Took about an hour and a half to install . Looks great.plenty of notices for other Jeep guys
5 #### Let me start off by saying I love this external battery . The size is smaller than others I have used , and the inclusion of the laser pointer and led are great additions . The one thing that is not clear is how it charges , which is brilliant . It uses a usb to microusb cable to charge the device so it can be charged by basically any modern phone adapter , but the best part is that once charged , the same cable can carried in the case ( also a great addition ) and then used to charge your phone ( assuming it 's not a iphone , which would require apple 's usb cable ) . Great quality and good aesthetics .
4 #### If you wear make up This is not a great cover for you because the color will seep into the shell .
5 #### Works great . I only wish that Samsung actually has a program built in , that could help transfer files into the device without me having to search frantically for one in the Play Store . If they 're gon na have an option for external devices , you 'd think they 'd actually have a program built into the phone to control it . But this particular item in review is perfect and affordable . Glad I bought it .
5 #### I own an auto repair shop . My head tech put his lab scope on this battery charger while charging a battery and said its output is the purest form of DC power he has ever seen , even better than a cars alternator . Best battery charger I have ever owned , and I have owned a lot of them . I just ordered another one for home .
4 #### ONLY AFFECTS MID TO UPPER RPM RANGE , BUT CAN FEEL IT WHEN UNDER LOAD . SOUNDS COOL !
4 #### I am very happy with this iPhone cord . It arrived before I was expecting it and it 's great not to have to be right up against the wall if I need to be plugged in and using the phone . It gives me more room and I love it .
5 #### Works great both with my Xti and my T3i I bought 2 adapters so that I can use an earphone extension cord as an extension cord for this one . The plugs are really small and potentially a bit fragile though the Canon one seems stronger than the one on my adaptors .
3 #### IT WAS THE BEST I COULD FIND AT THE REASONABLE PRICE CONCERNING MY 2012 DODGE . IF I DIDNT HAVE THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MINI VANS SINCE 1998 , THIS BOOK WOULD FALL SHORT . ONE BIG , BIG FAULT IS I HAD TO HUNT ALL OVER SEVERAL SECTIONS TO ULTIMATELY FIND TORQUE SPECS FOR SPARK PLUGS , INTAKE MANIFOLD , OIL FILTER , OIL DRAIN PLUG , BRAKE CALIPER RETENTION BOLTS , REAR SHOCKS ETC . AND FLUID CAPS FOR OIL , TRANS FLUID RADIATOR AND GAS TANK . WHEEL TORQUE AND TIRE PRESSURE SHOULD ALL BE ON ONE OR TWO QUICK REF PAGES . i PERUSED THE ENTIRE BOOK AND WROTE ALL DOWN , NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DO THAT , THE HAYNES BOOKS I USED IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WERE MORE COMPLETE . ALSO NO EXPLAINATION OF HOW OR WHY THIS VAN CAN USE E-85 / REG FUEL AND REAL LIFE RECS ON THIS SUBJECT . i DID BETTER TEAR - DOWNS AND RE - BUILDS AS A KID IN MY GARAGE . HAYNES SHOULD BE ASHAMED
5 #### Although these picks are much more substantial in overall size ( in terms of thickness ) than those used in the past , I very much enjoy the feature that makes it much more difficult to drop them when strumming . Quite satisfied with this purchase and would recommend these picks to others .
5 #### About every 2 years I need to replace the 2 batteries we use for our toy electric truck . We keep 2 so one can be ready when the other runs down . The 6 volt battery is much more affordable ( $ 20 ) than the 12 volt , so I would stay with the 6 volt toys . The 12 volt battery costs $ 50 . Interest in using the toy electric cars seems to be between 3 to 8 years old .
5 #### Nut kit worked very well and am pleased with the overall quality . Satisfied .
5 #### fit 1967 Camaro front to back . could be taller height , only covered half way down the wheels .using in doors so ok
1 #### First these were no Evo chargers . They were some Chineese chargers that only the home charger worked . The car charger worked for a day and the other cord was to short for anything else .
3 #### these were just what I wanted!!!great quality and style . I was EXTREMELY disappointed the Velcro was too short for ANY of three different cars !
5 #### No complaints . Serves the purpose I purchased it for . I would purchase again .
5 #### It 's a great product . I have Absorbers that are over 20 years old . I just wanted to have another one for my sons to help me dry the cars . Buy this and it should theoretically last forever if taken care of and kept in its original plastic tube when not in use .
2 #### I bought this case twice at different times . The first one had a problem as a snap in the back was cracked only a month of use . I then ordered the second one in hopes that the first one had been defective . However , the second one only lasted a few weeks as the case did not fit my phone completely . It looked so weird as the case appeared too small for the phone . Finally I had to take it off from the phone for a better look . This case is overpriced . With the design and bad quality of this case , the listing price for this case is not worth it .
5 #### This product is exactly what you 're thinking it is , and it does exactly what you think it should . It 's a quality Capo , and it 'll last until you leave it at a gig .
5 #### WHO MAKES FILTERS BETTER THEN FRAM ? :) EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT ON AMAZON AS FOR THE MOST PART MET MY EXPECTATIONS .
5 #### Handy stands , could n't do without them . Well made and easy to use .
5 #### I needed a decent capo for electric and acoustic that was easy to use and did n't cost a fortune . This was just the ticket . If you need a capo , you need not look any further , pick this one up and you 'll be happy . Great product and a great price .
5 #### I purchased this to replace the flimsy cable that I received from my ISP . This is much sturdier than the one that I replaced and my budget DSL service seems much more stable and consistent .
5 #### I 'm using it right now on my Lenovo Thinkpad 410 . It works great and I do n't notice I 'm using it on top of the regular keyboard .
5 #### Its good . Definitely worth buying . Since they are really cheap on amazon . The anti glare ones I think are a little better
4 #### Really nice case and fit very well .... Need to see how durable it is though
4 #### This is an excellent fog machine for a house party and brings out the best of my lasers , vertigo lights , and scanners . However , the included juice fog does n't last long enough so I had to fog again as soon as the machine is ready . I ended up just taping over the button for continuous fog all night . The included remote just creates potential hazard in the dark , so I pulled that off . Also , the outer shell gets HOT so had to put this behind the DJ booth to prevent anyone from burning themselves . Lastly , keep the fog furthest away from any air return vents . This is to prevent your juice money getting sucked into the vent in a hurry .
4 #### They do work , but definitely do n't last long . You get what you pay for , and that 's the truth . I do enjoy getting 5 packs though for that very reason .
4 #### Well made . Works as it should . However , seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a D800 . ( more than the usual expected ) To see if it was the Mic , cable , or adapter ; Tested it going straight into a Zoom H4 recorder . Seems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the XLR input . No big surprises . Minor clean up in post .
5 #### I have been using Vinylex for cleaning my vehicle 's interior and exterior for several years now . I prefer to other products rubber / vinyl / plastic protectants as it does n't leave much of a sheen once it dries ( as compared to something like Armor All ) . It also reportedly protects against sun damage and while I do n't have enough experience to confirm this is does keep things looking like new for a couple of months after an application .
5 #### Smaller then I expected but I luv it , & very useful when in desperate need to open phone tray , Thank u ! ! ! !
5 #### I was a counter but I bought it anyway and am glad I did . This takes water off my washed car like nothing I 've ever tried before . 3 washings including my wife 's dark blue car and it has not left a single water stain or streak . When I wear it out , I 'll be buying another .
3 #### Vater makes their 5A bigger in diameter than some and the added length made these really heavy . Felt and played more like a heavy 5B. I could n't use them .
5 #### Great bang for the buck ! Bushnell has been around forever and I have had multiple pair of binoculars in my life . 10X magnification is more than enough for most people most of the time . Often at sporting events , opera , live theatre , air shows ( and bikini beaches ) I see people with pricey binocs that have Hubble - like power and they do n't even really understand how to use binocs to begin with . If you are new to binocs do yourself a favor and buy these . Read the little paper insert and learn how to focus . Tell your friends you have pink eye so they wo n't borrow them and keep taking them out of YOUR adjusted settings . These are small enough to slip into your coat pocket , purse or backpack zipper pocket and go where you go . After you learn to love life with binoculars you can upgrade if you want but I think you will agree with me for 99 % of applications 10X tinies are peeerrrrrrfect ! I would share more info with you but .... omg ... omg .... its its its a Spotted Seattle Squawkbeak Redbellied Yellowhawk off in the distance !
5 #### they recommend you to clean every 50,000 miles .... WRONG ! ! clean it every 10,000 - 15,000 i cleaned mine at 10,000 because it seems like my MPG was getting lower than usual , took it out , sprayed generously with the cleaner , and ran water through it from the side where its clean to flush out the dirt on the other side , no high pressure water or you will damage the filter , if there is any debris left in there , use something really thin to fish it out , nothing sharp , did n't try vacuum cleaner but i would n't recommend it , compressed air not recommended as well , you might damage the filter , then when you are SURE you cleaned the cleaner off the filter completely with water , let it air dry , do n't not blow dry , air dry only , when it dried completely you re - oil it with the k&n oil till its evenly red all across , WIPE off the excess on the side from spraying ( if you got the spray type oils , i did ) , do no OVER oil it , as long as it turns red , no white , you 're good the oil restored my filter to its original glory , good as new tip : keep your old filter around , always , in case you need to drive while your filter is air drying , recommended ! !
5 #### What can I say about this product , fair price and gets job done . Seems to outlast competition with repeated use .
5 #### It sounds even better than my original strings on my $ 400 starter violin . I recommend this set .... You can be confident in this product .
5 #### great for small gigs ... no need to pay double for a standard sm58 if you are not playing in medium size+ place with bunch of different instruments and stuff ... especially if you are looking for just personal use for home recording and coffee shop gigs ... highly recommend !
5 #### I 've used these exact strings for over 20 years . Never had a problem . I get compliments on my tone . Love them . Highly recommended .
1 #### Love the length , but like the original , the ends become fragile and the circuit breaks .. ( Then you have to " wrangle " it around till you get the icon on the phone that 's charging .
5 #### Simple device ; Inexpensive ; Works well . Note the contacts are regular steel . If you want higher fidelity with gold headphone jacks , look for one similar to this , but with gold plated contacts . This little pigtail is quite flexible , and does not lose connection when bent .
5 #### I love these headphones . These are the exact headphones my dad has had for 20 + years . Amazing sound quality and extremely comfortable . And they must last long , since my dad still has his . What more can I say ? They 're amazing .
4 #### I heard these were good , use it for top snare mic , handles sound pressure well , an alternative to sm57 , ( sounds as good and can take a hit better ) also less expensive it you do smack it .
5 #### I have K&N filters in all our families vehicles . Clearly they are the best option out there , hands down ! Now granted they do n't always need servicing as their designed to go long periods of time with out it . However , as a habitual maintenance freak , i 've got an annual routine for spending a day each year servicing all of them ( 4 in total ) and this as you can imagine goes through a good bit of filter care product . So I come here to AMAZON now that i know i can save considerably over local retail for the exact same kit ! This single kit allows me to perform the cleaning , rinsing , drying and reoiling of all 4 filters . The shipping and handling end of this order was also fantastic , product received well before expected date which is always a nice surprise .
4 #### Prefect little radio that does exactly what you want it to . Throw it in your bag on the way to the beach or leave it on your desk at work for when things slow down . I love it !
2 #### I ordered 4 of these for DRO 's on my mini mill & lathe . Out of the 4 , I could only use 1 . The others were all oriented the wrong way . Too expensive to send back . Be careful when you order these . Double check to make sure they will work for you .
5 #### horriable very cheap and laster less than one day before it was broken
4 #### My 30 - year old Manhasset stand is so much more sturdy - the music shelf is so flimsy and easily bent on these new ones . Otherwise , it 's still a great stand .
3 #### I had the prior version of this holder but I lent it to a friend who broke it . So here we are again . I have the rather larger new Nexus 6P and it does fit just barely . I have noticed that if I do n't double check to make sure it 's tightened , my phone will fall off because my phone is as large as the mount fully extended . It 's also not as durable . I 've had the same issue with the previous version where on bumpy rides the whole structure collapses which is no bueno on the freeway . I 've cleaned my window and the suction cup the way they 've instructed but no help . I could easily solve this by using the dash mount . But I do n't like putting adhesives on my dash . So all in all , still a decent mount . I might be in the market for one that 's a bit longer and durable but until then I 'm going to say this is a keeper .
5 #### I got this as I had a wideband O2 sensor put in , and the wire for it ran close to the exhaust manifold piping , and I did n't want it to melt on me . I cut a 2 * 6 inch square and wrapped it around the wire , and 3 months later it 's still there and no problems . I think I got a generous amount for what I paid . I ca n't comment as to whether the adhesive will hold up if stuck to the chassis , but it wrapped around my wire and holds there .
4 #### Good product . I used on some light oxidation on a fiberglass RV . The oxidation was very light . This product recovered the finish however it could actually be better . Probably should have followed up with a coat of carnauba wax or similar product . I would say for medium to heavy oxidation you should probably pick a different product .
1 #### I know many people love the design , but I find it much too frustrating . You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly , then snap it in , then turn and turn the screw , oops do n't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw . Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again . What a farce . This is the worst capo I 've owned , and I 've tried nearly every brand and type . Yeah , I 've had people show me how to do it right , and I know to do it right . It 's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on , snapping it , screwing it in , screwing it off , having it fall off , forget it , it 's garbage to me . Also , while I 'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day , the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw . It 's actually slightly painful to the fingers ( momentarily , but why have to deal with that ? ? ) to work with . This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it . The only good thing I can say about it is looks durable . No thanks .
4 #### Yes , way too expensive for what it is , but it 's not made by anyone else and it DOES allow much more flexible usage of your flash unit . yes .. Canon should have used metal foot given it 's price .. add - on foot does the job . I also feel they could have used a bit more flexible cord as when you need to use full length like in your free hand , it wants to pull back too much . Rather than use just the replacement metal foot , I attached a metal flex joint type foot that allows even more adjustment . What are you going to do ? You really need it and only Canon sells it .. 6/03/2008 update ; New improved OC - E3 version out now ... even higher price to match . Also a couple of clones added to the market , not sure of their quality . Jan 2010 update ; Item is still working fine and has no broken parts .
5 #### Easy on and easy off , no kidding . You might hesitate because it is a cleaner wax and maybe not easy to work with . Nothing further from the truth . I did my truck and I did the hood of my gf 's 2001 Intrepid . I was curious to see how it 'd work on paint that old . Well , it went on just as easy and came off just as easy too ! Not only that , on the rest of her car you can see the leaves in the reflection of the paint but on the hood where I used PC you can see that they are green leaves . hehe . I 'm gon na do a coat of&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Liquid - Glass - LG100 - Polish-16 - oz / dp / B0002JMIEK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Liquid Glass LG100 Polish 16 oz.</a>&nbsp;on her car too . Darin
5 #### This thing is a recording requirement . Digital is nice , but not required .
3 #### It 's just a straight out beater . Nothing special about it . It 's a good weight , but the head does n't articulate . For me , I bought it to use on my electronic kit . Fit the need nicely . Light , quiet , cheap .
5 #### These allowed me to continue using my grill without having to replace it . They are nice and the price was good . I had difficulty finding them in my local home improvement store .
5 #### I go way back with this brand . I have a lot of guitars with different tunings and gauges , but the EXL117 set works best on my main LP - style guitar . It 's a half - step down and I occasionally drop the low string another full step . I also use this set on a 25.5 " scale guitar tuned a full - step down . Since I play a lot of heavy rock & some metal , I really need low strings with some thickness and tension to them , obviously more so tuning down , especially the low E. That thicker gauge makes such a huge difference in sound , and the tuning helps balance out the extra strain . And I do n't like wound G strings so that 's a plus with the EXL117s . It 's almost like this set was custom - built for me . Of course this is n't the only good string brand -- I have other guitars with GHS , Ernie Ball , and other D'Addario sets depending -- but to me the EXL117 is just the perfect set for my primary two guitars . I know there are tons of other options out there and I 've experimented with some of them , but there 's really no reason for me to fix what is n't broken . I pop these on and they break - in relatively quickly ( about an hour for me ) and are recording - quality for a good while . A person could go chasing after magical gear forever with all of the options nowadays but if you ca n't do it with one of the major sets , you ca n't do it .
3 #### I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola 850 .... it 's an improvement , but still does n't meet my expectations . Upon connecting , there are occasionally echos , but they go away soon , expecially if you turn down the volume . Range is very limited . Drops connection at close range occasionally . Cheap feel ; buttons do n't feel solid . Light weight and comfortable . Maybe there are just limitations with Bluetooth technology , but I have yet to find a headset that provides a crystal clear connection that is reliable . I 'm spoiled after working in Japan , where all of the cell technology provideds crystal clear communications .
5 #### When I got my phone I thought it was a great idea to have a USB port into the connector , whether it be for a car or wall plug , so all you need are several cables . It cuts down on the accessories when you travel , for sure . But after a few months , both connectors into the phone stopped working . They got too loose and would n't hold the connection / charge . These are the standard type of plugs which are more sturdy . The plugs ( with USB ports ) that came with the phone are in the trash .
5 #### I own it , I play it , and I think it 's the best hi hat stand available . It 's very smooth feeling , extremely well made , very adjustable , easy to set up and break down , folds for transport , and will last a lifetime . By the way , I play it hard- stomp on it with my foot . It takes a beating from me but handles it with no problems .
4 #### Easy to use and offers a surprisingly huge amount of compression . You will want to use your ear and try not to go overboard , because it quickly gets out of control . I needed this pedal so that I could achieve a classic , compressed wet tone and use it in conjunction with the Dunlop Micro Chorus . There are people who use a lot more compression than I do - for me , it is a simple means to achieving that particular compressed / chorused tone so often found in progressive rock and metal music genres . This pedal does the trick . Another great way to use this pedal is to achieve a nice analog compressed lead tone , similar to Greg Howe 's older tones from the early 90s . I would suggest avoiding this pedal if you use high output pickups . I would also suggest keeping this somewhat noisy compressor out of the effects loop . In front of the amp is fine - no noise , but in the loop , watch out ! Overall , you can not really find this pedal 's equal when it comes to value for money . It is built to last and delivers a pleasant analog compressed tone . Exactly what I needed . It 's a classic for a reason !
1 #### I 'm a pro player , play various saxes on gigs , & was looking forward to getting my new strap . I have used Neotech straps ever since they first came out , but it had been a few years since I purchased one . However , upon opening it and putting it on , it felt nothing at all like they used to . It seemed very cheaply put together , and almost like they left off the inner & outer layer of material . They were kind of spongy & bouncy , thus their claim of reducing the feel of the weight of the horn . Well this feels stiff , has very little cushioning , and will take quite a while to actually sit on my neck , as it is now so stiff , it just wants to remain straight . I am very , very disappointed in this , Neotech 's quality has gone way down hill , and I will be returning it .
5 #### Really like these capos . My second one . They work well . This design is fine as well
5 #### Guess you could say " I love it " ? Repaired some threads on my 78 Honda 400 so that my carburetors would bolt up tightly again . Super easy to use . I did n't use the plastic guide to thread the helicoil in as space was limited and I feel I did n't need to use it . If you need to repair some threads do n't be afraid to use something like this . Works well and could save you from some future problems of not having bolts tighten up properly .
5 #### This is one of the best books I have ever read . I laughed and cried ... It keeps you glued to it ! Thank you for sharing .
4 #### When they said hot pink they meant it ! Wow ! It is all it 's cracked up to be in the protection department , fits perfectly , and is easy to find in the bottom of my purse due to it 's neon color . The price is also unbeatable so it 's a great value as well .
5 #### the BEST Boss pedal on the market , great deal for the price !
5 #### D'Addario in my opinion will always be the best and most dependable option for electric guitar strings - they hold up to punishment in live performance , stay in tune well , and do n't suffer as much as other strings from age and use . Not to mention their myriad of combinations for string gauge and profile . I 've used them on many guitars and expect to continue for many years to come .
5 #### I purchased these picks for my son to use on his acoustic guitar . He kept breaking the lighter picks he had and wanted to try something that was a little more heavy duty . They seem to work well for him . He goes back and forth between these and some lighter picks , but he does use them frequently .
1 #### I purchased this headphone to use with my MP3 player . Normally I use it indoors . The sound is OK , maybe a little bassy ( subjective ) . Pros . The 90 degree plug . Cons . The metal head band allows the headphone to slide around on your hair . It 's design allows the two bands to slide inside of each other , thus grabing and pulling your hair . I need all I have . The ear pieces have a very difficult design to adjust the tightness of the set to your ears . Once you take them off , you have to reset them back to you favorite setting . I also have a problem with the wires that run from the ear pieces to the " Y " . Mine are getting stiff and brittle . I emailed Koss to see if this was a problem , but all they said was , send them back , we will check them . They are quaranteed . I am handicapped and can not go to the Post Office as often as I want . These are less than a year old . Plus the extra cost to mail them . Also not to have them to listen to my MP3 player when I am confined to bed , is inconvenient . I would not buy another set from Koss .
5 #### I have reciened my order for the order and I am very pleaced with the timely processing and shipment .
5 #### I bought 2 back up packets of replacement strings for my Fender acoustic . I believer in using the guitar 's own mfg strings if possible . Very good strings and a good buy .
4 #### I bought this 128 mg card at Costco and I like it for the most part but when played in my mp3 player , I have some problems with the music flickering on and off once in a while which does not occur with my 64 and 32 meg card . But it really does n't bother me since I only paid 59.99 at Costco . Its a great deal considering this little piece of memory has like 2000 times more RAM than Apple II 's from the 80 's !
3 #### Charger I received was closely similar , however , just a single USB , not dual . Product works well .
4 #### It works fine , with no extra noise . The FBQ portion is a nice little addition for setting up your FOH sound and any feedback frequencies . The dedicated Subwoofer allows you to not have to carry an extra crossover to hook one up . I usually only use subtractive EQ , so it does just what it is supposed to sound wise . Very transparent . One of the behringer products I would actually recomment .
5 #### The headset works great . I have no issues with using the headset . I had gotten different ones before but have had troubles . I found this one and it works great .
5 #### These strings sound pretty good on my Guild & Fender acoustic guitars . The quality of the strings and the sound it produces is sweet ! GOod price as well .
5 #### My BLU studio 5.0s fits quite nicely in it ( although there is some space remaining in all 3 dimensions ) . For the price , this brings solid construction and nice design too . Another reviewer stated that this is not literally " oversized " , and I also see that some larger phones ( which some could think more of a smaller tablet ) with very big cases / shells may not fit so well , because my phone is reasonably thin ( 8.9 mm ) , but the remaining space did not seem to be enough for oversized shells ( but can handle normal shells OK , I believe ) . The magnetic closure is smaller than I expected , so it is slightly hard to control the position to close the holster .
5 #### I like to wear these types of headphones when I run . You can still hear traffic coming with them on . The music sounds fabulous , good bass response and clear highs . The headphones are n't too tight or too loose . They dry quickly when sweaty . The cord is long and thicker than most cheap headphone cords .
3 #### This cover would be perfect if the bottom snapped on correctly . This phone does n't get used to much so that it does the job . Boy is the Impression a slippery phone without this kind of case .
5 #### Ernie Ball makes great straps just like all their other great products . I highly recommend this strap over even more expensive ones .
1 #### I have a very early version of this router in my home network . I assume it is v1 because it has been in use for at least a decade , probably longer . It has been in use so long I honestly forget . That router has been rock solid all these years and I use the advanced UPnP and port range forwarding features . You would think the newer version would still be dependable ..... sigh . Not so . I wanted a router for my mom 's home network so I purchased version 4.3 of this router while I am visiting for the holidays . I read all the negative reviews about the router freezing and the need to cycle power frequently . I decided to give it a chance anyhow given the flawless history of the early version I have at home . Darn , do n't waste your time and money like I did . The new version really is a PoS like so many reviewers before me have stated . It has been in use for a week now and it is going back to the store today . I have to cycle power every day , sometimes several times a day . I have never purchased anything but linksys hubs , switches , routers , modems and WAPs . Sad , this loyal customer must switch brands because the quality I have enjoyed in the past is no longer built into linksys products , at least this model for sure . I will try the D - Link DGL-4100 and hope I have better luck .
4 #### I purchased 2 of these . One for my car to convert the power to work with my iPhone 4 , and one for my clock radio that needed an extension to fit over my Otterbox Defender case . It works well in both applications , but it gets extremely hot while in use .
4 #### It is a great stand for the price and works great . The problem for me it do n't fit my 25 " Samsung TV with a 3 inch square mounting holes . The hole pattern on the stand does n't accommodate that small of a pattern . You will need to do some re - drilling of the stand bracket or get a plate that can be bolted on to the existing mounting to accommodate the smaller hole pattern . Other than that it is a great
5 #### I use this to record my guitar - playing , and it serves me well . Sound is good , as is the volume level . Priced well and shipped quickly .
4 #### Great sound and has lasted forever . This was worth every penny . It 's not on the level of those super - enhanced headphones you see that cost several times more , but for what you pay for , you get a really great value . I 've had no real problems with this product at all . Considering I 've had them for about 3 - 5 years ( ca n't remember ) that 's really good .
4 #### It arrived on time in all original packaging . I love the blue light when you plug it in . It works great with my galaxy nexus and blackberry phone . My only complaint is I wish it was a lil more sturdy and not so cheap looking . But great charger .
5 #### Changing your fuel filter is a part of your autos routine maintenance , an essential part of your fuel system . For Fords , as with my older Mustang , it starts with the preferred Motorcraft brand .. It installs in just a few minutes . You just need a flat tip screw driver , a fuel filter tool , and a container , to catch a couple of ounces of fuel , once you disconnect each line . Before you start , though it is recommended that you relieve some pressure like loosening your gas cap . Safety glasses , are also important , to protect your eyes . And just make sure when you install the new filter , you have the proper flow , as indicated on the filter with a direction symbol . Lastly , get your parts through Amazon , at a really good price .
5 #### My new favorite 10 gauge strings . I 've been using Ernie Ball 10 's for years , and you could n't convince me to use anything else ... These shipped with a guitar related purchase and I need to re - string a guitar and all I can say is " WOW ! " . A new string job usually brings life back into a dead sounding guitar , but these strings in particular accentuated each note so much better than I 've heard in the past . The lows and mids are punchier and the highs are twangier with more spank . Some may think that strings are strings , but these particular strings by D'Addario are spectacular . The price you 'll pay for a three pack are well worth it . As a devout Ernie Ball guy in the past , I can honestly say that these are the best sounding strings that I 've ever used , so I bought a ton and restrung the rest of my guitars , whether they needed it or not .
5 #### I too was a little skeptical about purchasing this unit after reading some reviews . However , I did n't have a huge amount of money to spend on a radio and could n't justify spending more to get a Sony one that did n't even have a digital tuner ( a must for running ! ) . I was surprised it did n't come with batteries , but that was minor . It picks up all local stations crystal clear ( and I live in a big city with a lot of outside interference ) . The included ear pieces are a little weird , but they work fine and you can use whatever earpieces you desire . For the price you ca n't go wrong .
4 #### Whiter than the stock halogens . Down road light is pretty good also .
5 #### My husband has been playing guitar for 15 years and says these are good strings . Will buy again .
4 #### 5 or 6 of these checkerboard picks had messy , defective checkers on them . You could see it through pack . No big deal , but the picks with the shifted , crooked checkers seem to play softer . None of them have the same snap or twang that the Tortoise shell ( or especially the sea shell ) colored Fender picks . They seem harder . These are kinda soft .
5 #### Finally a string that works . Well ... for me . So after years of playing mid level guitars I bought a Gibson acoustic . Sounded kinda dry . So I put my normal Ernie Ball earth woods on it . Sounded even worse . The search was on ! It seems as though the more quality instrument you have , the more you can really actually hear the tone . After about 10 different sets of strings I found these . I LOVE THEM . Last a long time tone is great easy to play . Very happy . Yes they cost a little bit more but they are def worth it . I had the 80/20s also but these .
5 #### Lisle 45900 Hood Prop Very nice part and quality made you will not be unhappy with this purchase , works great as the manufacturer intended . I have been using mine for some time now and it 's still working GREAT :-) Buy with confidence . RagenRat
4 #### This is a good harmonica expecialy if you like a wood comb . Wood comb makes it a mustash hanger and being nailed together makes it hard to service for adjustment and cleaning . BUT ! if you ike this kind of harmonica the Folkmaster is just as good for 1/2 the price .
1 #### This product was NOT compatible with my 2004 Ford F150 4x4 super crew cab as specified .
5 #### They are great ! Best reeds my child has used for daily high school band . 1 reed lasts longer than other brands !
5 #### These are the strings you want . Stop looking for a better deal . There 's a reason everyone uses Ernie Ball .
5 #### k&n filters do an awesome job of trapping debris and allowing airflow while cutting down on waste ... I prefer these filters and will continue to use them . helpful tip : save your old filter to swap out when you trade your vehicle in .
5 #### Gone are the days when I fumble around with my fat and useless fingers while changing strings . Much like the proto - man of old , I have learned to use tools !
1 #### This item is very cheap looking . Do n't waste your time buying it . I never used mine . I thru it away .
1 #### I get video for just about a second or two and get error message " This accessory is not made to work with iPhone " . Does n't even charge the iphone .... tried all the suggestions in all forums but still can not resolve issue .
5 #### I 've used my Hohners to accompany my guitar playing and singing with a neck holder ( a la Bob Dylan , John Lennon , etc ... ).I do n't play many songs that require harmonica , but when I do the Hohner tone does it right . I 've used a cheap set of harmonicas when I started but found they did n't cut it like the Hohners . My mom bought me my first G Hohner and I blew out a reed on it . So I had to replace it with another . I bought a second hand guitar and it had a Hohner A in it 's case with it(what a find ) . I like the Hohner Marine Band a lot . A little expensive but they 're worth it .
5 #### Works as expected . No issues after two years of moderate use .
5 #### This is a fabulous set of products ! They will keep your fabric top very clean and protected . We use it regularly !
4 #### For all leather ... especially my motorcycle seat , gloves and leather jacket !
4 #### We bought these for use with our pop - up camper and they work very well for that purpose . They are toothed on top and bottom to allow for good traction on most surfaces and the curve of the top fits our tires quite well . These are lightweight and have holes for use with a rope if you prefer to tie them together . While they are not as rugged as rubber chocks , they work very well for our purposes and I will likely replace them when they get old or worn .
5 #### These great light bulbs arrived very quickly , perfectly packaged , and undamaged - Thank You ! ! ! This is the 2nd set to go into my little sister 's Jeep Cherokee that had those awful , dull , yellow , factory lights .. These bulbs of course , changed all of that , and gave her bright , white , focused , headlights , that she needed . They lasted 5 years and one burned out , so we replaced both of them and have one for back up in an emergency .. PIAA in all my decades of using their products has always been way ahead of everyone else in my lighting needs ..
5 #### This is my second unit ( I lost the first one ) and I am very please with it . I hate having wires when I am running or simply working out , so this is a perfect match for my iPhone 4 . There are times when the bluetooth loses the signal for a second , but it does not bother me at all since all i do is shift it around or place in elsewhere ( back pocket , other hand , top of treadmill , side of the bench ) . All in all , is a great product and I would recommend it .
4 #### Hosa CMS-103 3.5 mm TRS to 1/4 inch TRS Stereo Interconnect Cable , 3 feet I ordered this cable after noticing my Bluetooth transmitter connected to my A / V Receiver with a 1/4 in ch converter from the 3.5 mm cable , was scratchy and would actually drop one channel . After twisting and messing with it a while , I decided to forgo using the converter and just buy this solid cable . Problem solved . It is just a cheaply made cable , so I give it four stars for now . I may return to this review if it holds up well and performs to a solid performance such that it deserves another star . I like it so far .
4 #### I bought these for my hood light bracket on my Jeep . They were easy to install with the instructions provided and are very bright . Great for off and on road driving conditions . The lights get very hot and I had trouble aiming them because I burned myself on the cases after they had been only only a couple of minutes . The cover on one melted as I was aligning the other one . Overall very satified with the product .
2 #### Did n't like this at all . Kept shutting off , and , when it did work , the volume was too low . Move on , intrepid shopper !
5 #### Great price and fast shipping , item is exactly as described .
4 #### I purchased this to put on my monitor at work to see people behind me . I wear headphones at work and without this I could n't tell if someone was wanting to talk to me . It sticks nicely to the corner of my monitor and 2 " is a perfect size to see what I need to .
4 #### really set off my truck . exactly correct for the purpose .
5 #### Great deal ! Worked as promised . Very easy to assemble and the charge hold as needed and promised in the advertisement .
4 #### I play hard so light strings rarely hold their tune . These have stayed in tune for more than a month and still sound clean .
3 #### Surge protection is not the only issue one need consider with respect to television , stereo , or computer hardware . AC power noise is another aspect to consider in order to maximize the quality and life of your investments . I found the Monster Cable PowerCenter a fine small investment for surge protection while also allowing a modest improvement in TV picture quality . UPDATE A YEAR+ LATER : The surge protector flat out went dead . No signs of power surge as others in the area were present and did not suddenly die . Overall , as typical with Monster products , overpriced and apparently not one that is long lasting .
5 #### Bought this as a Christmas gift for a teen , looks pretty , price was great . Package came on time even with the holidays .
1 #### Received this item New Replacement 9 Cells High Capacity Li - Ion Battery for IBM ThinkPad Compatible Models in a timely way , properly packaged . However , it failed to charge on or power my Lenovo - IBM ThinkPad T60 -- a laptop explicitly mentioned as compatible with this battery . The laptop 's charging system did not detect the battery , and no amount of workarounds seemed to help . I do not know if the failure to detect the battery was due to the lack of an identifying chip in the battery , dead cells in the battery , or no cells at all in the battery .. In any case , returned it to Amazon ( free return shipping ) for a full refund . A+ to Amazon ; -0- to this vendor ( fulfilled by Amazon ) and product . Purchased a different replacement battery from Amazon and that seems to be working just fine -- it was twice the price of the failed one . TANSTAAFL ! ( There Ai n't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch ! )
5 #### Works just like I wanted them to . These sticks give you about an extra 1/2 inch to use . The balance point ( fulcrum ) changes for most people who use these ( i ve asked around ) . But its nothing major . I like the extra weight . And the x5BN gives me more meat to get as many rimshots as I can out of a set .
3 #### To me the lens is okay . I do not love it . I use it for some sport action shots . It is something about the focusing that seems off . Plus , when it is focusing the noise is distracting .
5 #### I was a bit skeptical about buying this product online but was relieved after see how well it works on the windscreen during those really heavy rain showers . LP
5 #### I use this lens with my Digital Rebel 6.3 megapixel camera . I 'm one of those shaky photographers , and I knew from past film camera that anything beyond 150 mm I would not be able to keep steady enough . I also wanted to have the ability to take photos in low light situations beyond 100 mm . This lense is basically the most affordable that Canon offers with this range flexibility ( 100 - 300 mm ) and with autofocus and image stabilization . Canon makes a wide array of higher end lenses , and some will offer faster image stabilization or clearer picture quality , but for most photographers , you 'll find this lense works very well . If you use the image stablization a lot ( like for every picture ) you may want to carry a spare battery too , as the IS feature does cause some minor battery drain depending on how much you use it . I found with my Rebel that adding the battery grip with both batteries installed not only lets me take pictures ( tons of pictures ! ) but it also further helps balance the weight of the camera with this lense attached .
5 #### Super loud . Exactly what I needed on my old Honda .
4 #### It is cheap product and I bought it from the same seller with two more products , but still they charger me a separate shipment for each one ( which I do n't know why ) . otherwise it is good to have it ...
3 #### These wooden mallets are serviceable but perhaps better for a child to use . I was disappointed that they are shorter than advertised . Measuring from the top of the wooden ball heads to the bottom tip they are 7.5 " , not the 8 " as described . Although I can use them their shortness makes a big difference in gripping them for the best control in playing . The sound they produce are also a bit harsh for the xylophone and glockenspiel . A longer medium hard mallet would be better than these .
4 #### In times pass the arrival of my precious guitar strings has been more reassuring by way of the neat and unbattered packaging . Usually very , very good , and While the product did arrive in fine quality and quality working order I found myself a wee bit unsettled by the less than perfect looking presentation . Admittedly I ' ve grown accustomed to your excellence , and any thing seemingly less shakes up my nice , neat , cozy perspective of being a valued / cherished :) ( smile ) customer . So please do not alter your in service to any less than Excellence !
3 #### pretty good ... I guess . Looks cool , solid build works well .. i'm not sure I like the sound but it 's not too bad .. a little fuzzy . I sent mine back and bought a Bugera b15 . It was a little more but has a lot more options
5 #### It works fine .. Not much to say about a printer cable . The price is good for a 10 ' cable . Look no further if you need one
5 #### This is the way to buy hose .. I bought 5 sizes of this and have used some of all of them The cost for these spools of hose is met the first time you need a piece as time and fuel to buy exactly the length you need at the parts store plus what they ask for it .
5 #### I am watching Dish tv at the sound level I need without bothering my wife .
5 #### Solid construction . Plenty of height , potentially too tall for any car or small SUV . They work perfect on a lifted truck .
5 #### Muy buen producto , " Original 100 % " Lo recomiendo ! aprovechen el buen precio , lo recibi en Venezuela en el tiempo estipulado . Saludos .
5 #### This cable keeps my devices connected . I enjoyed plugging them in .
4 #### These were only ones I could find that stick out far enough to allow my vision of vehicles behind my camper . cumbersome to adjust otherwise 5 star rating .
4 #### I compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own . I prefer this more as i play live and it does a good job in handling noise snd also has a no questions asked lifetime warranty . Just take your broken cable to your local guitar center and they will replace it . I got 4 replacememts over 3 years . Worth the higher price because of the warranty . The 100 dollar studio pro does nt do well live compared to this rock cable as the studio pro sucks up tone snd only sounds good for recording . note , this cable has high mid range so if that s what you like go for it
4 #### have only used it for a few weeks but like the footprint and the quality . five more words are required
5 #### This stuff works great and the price and shipping were all excellent . I ended up thinking one roll would work on a F250 front door , nope . It took nearly two rolls , so I had to order more , but that 's okay , I did .
5 #### I 've tried just about every make of round wound electric guitar strings in the last 30 - 40 years , and I 've settled on D'Addarios for all my guitars . Their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency , the price is right , they 're color coded to make string changing easier , and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more . The 10s are my choice for rock and blues .
4 #### Good , but easily bent . As long as you do n't overtighten the bolts these brackets absolutely do the job for a fraction of what others charge . Use a wrench and not an impact to tighten and you should be fine . I use two , one for the drop hitch and one for the tow bar . I towed a car cross country twice with these and they kept the hitch nice and sturdy .
5 #### I installed this in an existing opening in my dash and hard wired it . After nearly a year , all the plugs are working fine . I use them a lot . I plan to buy another one . Good stuff . One drawback . The red power light . It is so bright that in nearly blinds me while driving at night . I covered it with black paint two days after I installed it . Love it . No more having to buy separate car chargers !
5 #### I did n't get to use this muffler , but it looked great ! I like welded better than crimp style . It was to big for my application I thought I was getting smaller I.D & O.D so I had to return and get different one .
5 #### Own 2 of these . Work well with my wired network
4 #### Was somewhat hesitant to purchase this product after reading a couple negative reviews on the display , but after receiving and using this product I am quite pleased with it considering the low price I paid . Easy to use , which was one of my criteria . There is little to fault the display . . . . it is reasonably readable if the unit is not positioned at too much an angle for viewing . I have no regrets .
5 #### I purchased the small size first for my Oakley Canteen . But that was too small . This fits perfect .
5 #### I have been trying to get a good clear sound by plugging my guitar directly into my all in one computer 's mic input but having to use an adapter caused noise . This cable solved my problem . Really clear sound now on my tracks . Excellent ! I 've been using Audacity and with just a few effects added to the guitar sound , some may think that I 'm another Buck or Johnny .
2 #### This is a 710mAh battery . The original , stock battery in a Razr V3 m is 780mAh . This battery is less powerful and will provide about 25 % less run time then the stock battery in the Razr V3 m. Check your battery mAh rating first , it 's marked right on the battery .
5 #### I fabricated these to the front of the front fenders , look great
4 #### The thing works but gets VERY hot very quickly . I 'm not sure if it 's a hazard or anything but we just used it a few pumps then turned it off .
5 #### Nice looking with a great fit . Thick plastic that might actually hold up over time . Does n't block much of light beam
5 #### As I stated in my review for the TRICO Exact Fit 18 - 1 blade , this 22 inch fits " exactly " on my mom 's 1993 Civic . It went on with ease and sits perfectly on the windshield . Removing the old Bosch blades was the only problem . Who knew you have to physically rip apart the top of the connector on the blade that the J hook slides into ?
5 #### Lasts a verrrrry long time , sounds warm and has a beautiful crack ! sound . It 's an industry standard head , a large number of pro drummers use the coated emperor X for the snare drums . I would recommend getting this head on your snare , and getting coated emperor 's for the rest ; you 'll have an amazing sounding kit !
5 #### worked flawlessly on a 2003 Jeep Rubicon with Pioneer stereo !
4 #### I 've never used a synthetic chamois before , so I 'm not sure how well they are supposed to work . I washed my minivan the other day ; and I 'd say it took one swipe on a panel , squeeze dry , then a second swipe to completely dry the panel . The Absorber is a nice , large size . It dries my car better than old bath towels , and it left no water spots . I 'm very happy with its performance and would buy it again .
5 #### Nice string tool , works well for the most part . Occasionally it has problems cutting the high E string . Nice having an all in one string tool to keep in your case with a set of strings .
5 #### I have untangled my last pair of earbuds . These Panasonic have better bass response than the earbuds that come with Android or iPhones and sound better than a more expensive pair of Altec Lansing earbuds I bought . And they do n't fall out of your ears ! You ca n't go wrong for the money . There are better lightweight headphones on the market , and some are several hundred dollars . But these work absolutely fine for ten bucks .... and I 'm a musician .
5 #### I 've tried many exercise headphones over the years . These ones , and the slightly lighter " sportapros " are the ones I keep coming back to for their excellent sound and comfort . Sure they break after a few years , but given the abuse they get , I 'm more than satisfied . Plus , if you really want to get your money 's worth , Koss has a lifetime guarantee that they actually seem to honor . ( I used it once on a prior pair but felt guilty doing it a second time . )
5 #### I 'm not a great player but I really like these strings on my Fender Strat , and Epiphone Riviera . Very smooth and playable . Inexpensive but great strings .
4 #### This keyboard is an acquired taste . Once you put the time into using it , typing on it for hours at a time is definitely easier on the hands . It does have a clackity clack sound when typing and I had to make a special wrist support pad ( 2 by 4 cut with a bandsaw to fit the contours and a gel pad on top ) . The keyboard is roomier ( and larger ) and I learned to touch type on it . Put small felt dots on the F and J keys to make it easier to get your fingers on the home keys . With the new Intellikeyboard software , I remapped all of the gray buttons to things like Word , Explorer , cut , copy , paste , next application , open , close , exit , print and more ! Its like having the new MS office keyboard with the ergo that I crave . I simply can not type on a slab anymore . Too cramped , too quiet , and too painful .
5 #### Received these screen protectors today ! They are amazing ! ! ! I have had many , many cell phones over the years and have tried an equal amount of protectors . Both cheap and expensive . We have Evo 4gs and the cut is perfect . I have NEVER had such an effortless install ... on Both phones ! ! ! A few tiny bubbles that were easily removed and I was done . PATIENCE is all you need . I do n't have a dust free environment as we have 4 small dogs and a cat ! ! Not one single speck of dust or anything else on the screens ! Perfect , perfect , perfect application ! ! Highly recommend you try this screen protector ! !
2 #### I just return this case to the Verizon store . I liked the look of the case , but it make the phone too heavy . Now if you are a person , who wears the phone on their hip , you might not mind it . I put my phone in my pocket , so it helped to almost de - pant me serveral times . Try the rubber cases , this phone is already too big and heavy for a heavy case .
5 #### Installed on 2006 Ural . Only issue is narrower and taller than original so mounting bracket needs to be modified .
4 #### I like it . If you need an inline volume control , this works . It does have a bit of an issue when the iphone 's volume is all the way up- it gets overdriven . I thought there was a problem with it , but by avoiding the iphone - all - the - way - up it has been doing the job for months .
5 #### Heavy Duty Extra Large Vertical Smart Phone Case / Pouch / Holster with ... GCP fits perfect with my cell phone
5 #### Works great but not as good as a chemical resurface ... but easily visibly better even after it dries ... plenty for multiple applications .
5 #### This bluetooth works great ! Clear sound and communication is clear as well . It 's fairly comfortable and fits stays put too .
5 #### I 've owned this product , bought thru Amazon , for about 3 months . The sound quality is superb ! My Ipod tones are much louder and richer , and I have to decrease the volume on many songs instead of wishing I had more volume with those annoying Ipod earbuds . Please do not purchase this Sony headphone from the Apple website , or you will wind up paying about 20 dollars more for it after base price , tax and shipping . Sony has another winner in these headphones .
5 #### Actually keep this in the bike ... works well to do a quick detail
5 #### Easy to use , softens old leather , seems to be good for leather , too .
5 #### I like this strings and always buy them for my acoustic metal , and buy the electric version too for my electric .
3 #### The product is good . It fits my 2 G Iphone perfectly . I have no complaints on the product . I only have one complaint about the merchant ( Bargaincell ) , they took forever to ship the product , did not keep me statused AT ALL on the shipping process .
3 #### I wo n't say I am 100 % happy with this puppy : it took a number of attempts on my own and a trip to the nearest T - Mobile store to get it to like my Blackberry Pearl . But finally , after the two of them get along well with each other , I am a happy camper . My only complain now : seeing how I can find a number of less expensive options in Amazon , within days of having purchased this one . I feel inclined to return it ... It 's not like I am attached to it by now .
5 #### I was looking for something that I can quickly move from one vehicle to another without any tools or damage to the vehicles , but have better range that you can get with a tiny antenna . This , along with a Wilson " Little Will " antenna is perfect . The pictures of it are incomplete however . They show it with a battery holder and with the car adpater attached . There are two battery holders , one for 8 AA cells , and one for 6 . And there is an AC adapter / charger not pictured as well . For hand use , a Cobra HA - TA antenna can extend the range .
3 #### There cheap but they work , would recommend for kids since they are always breaking stuff.lol
5 #### Great product . It came as described and works just as you would expect . The price was perfect , shipping was fast , and i would defenitly order again .
5 #### This is the only cable I have used in the past 10 years . Studio , live , and at home , it performs well in all aspects . The biggest plus on top of that is lifetime warranty . This means that whenever the cable gets faulty ( which is n't often at all ) you can get it replaced free of charge . This has kept me from having to buy cables for 10 years . Yes , it is pricey upfront , but you will never ever have to buy another cable . I also use a 12 ' Monster Cable to run from my DI to my amp when needed . I plan on buying all Monster cable if / when I ever start using pedals .
2 #### They work fine but they do n't look like any Belkin brand cable I have ever bought before . They do not have Belkin logos or part numbers anywhere , even on the packaging . BEWARE!^@#&$ & *
2 #### I was more successful just using an old DISH antenna arm .
4 #### these cables are nicely constructed . i bought them for home use only . home recording or just practicing . they seem to work well so far . i would nt gig with these on a regular basis , but for home use , with little abuse , they should last .
5 #### Comes with Adapter . This thing controls your tone so well ! ! ! ! ! Everything about it is just so much worth the money i m starting to fall in love with MXR !
5 #### I have used it to change the oil just once so far to change the oil and filter on a tdi vehicle . So far so good , good suction , easy set up . I would recommend this product .
5 #### Having just used some really crappy Chinese gauges , these are awesome in comparison . They feel very sturdy , the hoses feel like high quality rubber hoses , not just vinyl crap hoses some of the others have . The valves are nice and tight and seem like they 'll hold up . The R-134a connections are really nice , heavy , and seem much more sturdy than the cheap ones I was just using .
5 #### If you carry your own wireless mic this is the way to go . The receiver mounts to a strap with velcro and sits snugly in the foam surround . There 's a cut out for a mic and a belt pack too . In the back there 's an accessory bag that holds the power adaptor and the antenna can stay mounted and pop up thru the top for use . Outside pocket is perfect for keeping a cable handy . Just read the instructions to make sure you get all the benefits
5 #### Excellent pad for buffing . I like that Meguiar 's has multiple pads for different processes . Really like the hook and loop for fast pad changes .
5 #### Man , slap some batteries in this bad boy , plug in a harmonica mic and go to town !
4 #### The sound is perfectly fine . I could n't tell any difference in quality when I had it connected directly or through this volume adjuster . The cord eventually wore out after a lot of abuse . I wish it was stronger .
4 #### I have had this phone for a few months now and I really like it . It 's fairly light ( though wide ) and solid . The features are really nice to have . The sound is good . I have not used it as a music player yet ( and likely wo n't ) but for phone , email , texting it 's great . The only thing I find hard is " typing " on those keys because they are so far at the bottom of the device that it tends to pitch backwards because I have to hold it at the very bottom . I would love to see a phone where the display is at the bottom and the keys on top so I can hold it with my whole hand instead of my tippy tips of my fingers . I also end up not using the internet much because it 's soooooo slow and you can only see a teensy part of the website at a time ( unless you zoom out , in which case you ca n't read jack ) . But it 's good for those times where you 're out with friends and just need to know how old Sally field is ( 62 , in case you wondered ) . I have some issues with ATT customer service , but that 's another review ...
3 #### I know its cheap but it feels really cheap , almost dollar store quality . With that being said , it does get the job done and has n't fallen apart yet so I say its worth it .
5 #### Have used these several times before . Always satisfied . This is the only brand I use on my mandolins Thank You .
5 #### Each outlet is labeled which helps in identifying your device when needing to change or move it . We have had this since 2008 and we have gone through thunder storms , power outages , etc ... and we have not had any issues with our electronic devices .
5 #### I had a rough idle issue ( significant engine hesitation ) with my 2001 Acura TL . The check engine light came on and the code says " multiple cylinder miss fire " . There was also couple other codes . I inspected the spark plugs and cables and all worked fine . Cleaned my EGR ports but they looked reasonable too . I also did throttle valve cleaning . Nothing worked so the last resort was to try Seafoam . It solved the problem and I am very pleased .
4 #### I bought two of these for use with two Garmin nuvi 1450 units . In my opinion , it is unfortunate that the Garmin nuvi 1450 requires extra storage capacity to handle updates ; I think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the United States and Canada . I do n't know yet whether I am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and I do n't know whether a bigger card is available .
5 #### I used them once so far for a jam session and they worked fine .
1 #### Its not quick release ! You press in the side with all your might and eventually it open . I have small finger ( white now ) so I with difficulty got a grip and opened it . If you are a man you will have trouble opening it . My son is 11 and it took him a long time to open it and he can open anything !
5 #### This is without a double the ' best ' shower radio I have ever owned . The reception is crisp and clear and I love the pre - programmable stations . It is also a very attractive radio and so when not in the shower with me , it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter . It 's very user friendly ; no complicated directions . Perfect for us 50 + technically challenged . I would definitely recommend this product to everyone .
3 #### These sounded GREAT . Unfortunately I played an outdoor gig in Houston , in August , and they went dead within a few days of the show .
3 #### Would be 6 stars if they made them the way they used to . Are you listening Fender ? These are still a STEAL for $ 300 but do n't buy one sight unseen , their QC is all over the place . FYI when these first came out they were perfectly setup out of the box and much lighter too ! ! far better than any MIM Strat and even better than most $ 1000 sub - Standard US models . Now the bad part : like most things the quality of these gems has gone WAY down and the weight has gone up plus the necks have some nasty brown grain - stains and sharp frets , they are using cheaper wood and Blind Leper slave labor must do the setup . If you buy a new one now you will probably need a whole pro setup and fret dressing ( at least ) a $ 300 + job so is it still a great deal ? You decide . IMHO Look for a used one at least 5 - 6 years old ( if you can find one ) guys who bought these tend to hang on to them for a reason . nowadays , it 's not the guitar you are paying for but the professional setup , something you used to get free .
5 #### Great for small laptops that do n't have an internal player .
1 #### worked ok for a couple of uses then stopped working on me , love their more premium cables and wanted to try these but disappoint , love other products from this brand though .
4 #### Lights up bright I like everything about it . I gave for stars only because when I went to hook it up the wiring that plugs into the hitch was n't long enough to reach the factory plugin by about 2 inches how can it be too short ? either everyone who 's ordered this has to modify it to work or my truck is just different than all others ? easy fix just shoudn't be an issue to begin with
5 #### Worked great for elk season ! all 6 of us had them and they worked great for keeping in touch and hunting the elk herds . Would n't leave home without them for hunting . I was able to talk to my son and help him with his hunt .
5 #### Got this GPS in 2000 as a fancy toy . Reception can be irritating , but it seems to do better than most -- it 's locked on 5 birds / 20 feet in my living room . Battery life is great ( I used NiMH rechargables ) , the screen is great , interface is intuitive , etc . I 've decided to give one to my dad for his birthday . I definitely recommend the PC cable w/ 12V adapter ( part # 010 - 10268 - 00 ; double - check Amazon 's recommendation ) , as there is a lot of free and not - so - free mapping and waypoint management software ( TopoGrafix , for starters ) . It holds 500 waypoints and ~ 1500 trackpoints ( 10 tracks ) . In 3 years of long ( ~ 60 mi ) rides , long car trips , etc I 've not had a problem with the memory limits . The price is right , the unit works great , and it 's plenty of GPS for my knocking around . And , for the record , I can get readings in commercial aircraft -- just hold it up to the window and give it time to acquire .
5 #### Eclipse has a great style . I find this black phone impressive . It has lights on the outside . If you 're wondering whether to go for the Eclipse or the LX , go for the Eclipse because it has a better build quality , a better design , is not as easy to scratch and the display outside has three buttons . This phone does not come with headsets , you 'll have to buy them . The battery life is excellent and the interface is much improved over the Katana LX . The Eclipse is available in Pink , Black and Silver . The keys are silver and firm to touch while the keys on the LX were black in colour . I would take either the Silver or Black Eclipse for myself but honestly the black just makes you feel so good . Light , easy to operate , loud reception , this phone is near perfect . Highly recommended .
5 #### Tight fit and it seems to be well put together . the sun does n't seem to bother it so that 's a good thing .
5 #### GOOD SERVICE BUT AS THEY SAID IT TOOK A WHILE , I AM SURE THIS DOES NOT LEAK AS CURING IS 7 DAYS
5 #### been using these for years , they work well and i will always use these as my everyday string .
3 #### This winder and cutter ... winds and cuts fine ... But the pin puller does not fit my guitar pins even though the ad claims that , " ... it fits virtually all guitars , banjos and mandolins ... " Oh well ... another lessson learned .
4 #### Wish there were more mounting options . Would be nice if could grab over the back of a hardcover book . The metal clip does n't expand enough . Would also be nice to clip onto an old kindle ( non - paperwhite / self - lighted version ) . Definitely thin and gives off a wide field of light .
1 #### I installed it as directed . Directions say tighten to no more than 60 foot pounds . So I set my torque wrench to 40 foot lbs based on the size of the bolt . Plate started bending at around 20 foot points . And it did n't really hold the hitch . Either the slots are too large to allow for smaller ubolts or the plate steel is too soft . Also . The pictures show an anodized nut . While the bolt was stainless , nuts and washers we 're just regular zinc plates hardware . Sent it back . I 'll just live with the rattling .
5 #### winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well .
4 #### Great little replacement for my Microsoft optical trackball . Works well I do wish the mouse was a bit larger . Very responsive and the transmiter fits in my Dell desktop and I can close the bay door . I would rater have a new Microsoft Optical Mouse but alas they quit making them a decade ago . Its the best trackball on the market .
3 #### Did n't fit my items very well . Cell phone + case is too big to fit in either of the side slots , so I have to put it in the long front tray . Kindle barely fits in the middle . Plug holes are only at the bottom , so sometimes I have to turn whatever I 'm charging upside down . The back flat does n't stay closed very well and does n't have a whole lot of room for 4 different cords . But it serves its function of controlling some of the mess on my nightstand .
5 #### Just installed on 2015 Tacoma , I really liked the fact that the compass / temp are in the bezel below the mirror . Some units have the display in the right hand quadrant of the mirror . The temp / compass displays are bight enough in daylight , and not too bright at night . The instructions are very clear , and the unit worked the first time , and self calibrated after about four turns . The mirror itself is clear , and the day / night aspect of the unit works great . The map lights are cool in that they do not blind the driver . All in all a great unit . Took me about two hours to install , well worth it .
5 #### Purchased one of these to replace broken jack plate on a 1970s era Gibson Les Paul . Came with a set of screws and fit perfectly . A two minute fix . Considered the aftermarket version but this was only a couple of bucks more at least from the seller I got it from , so no point going the cheap route . Color is perhaps a shade or two off the original but that 's probably due to aging .
2 #### I made a mistake getting this for two kayaks . Get the Hull - a - Port if you 're hauling a 12 + kayak and 10 ft kayak . It 's MUCH faster to use that over this . It was taking me FOREVER to securely tie down my kayaks . Ended up getting the Hull - a - port during the sale and I am MUCH happier with it 's easy to load capabilities . I just needed something that took less time and I 'm not happy with this device .
3 #### For a few years I have been with verizon .My last phone was the Motorola e815 .Recently I retired and did n't need all the mins I got on the $ 39 plan(with taxes came to $ 44 ) pro : I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T - Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great . con : When I went to program speed dialing .Boy was I disappointed .First it would only allow 20 voice tags .Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I did n't have to record my voice on each number , anyones voice would work using any name in my phone book .The Razr is supposed to be an improvement , which it 's not .The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned , and now Motorola screwed it up .Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dial , taking your hands off the wheel .Wake up Motorola , That s stupid .
5 #### Easy to install and love them a must for any car especially in FL ! We like to crack windows a bit due to heat and the vent visors are great . We have them on all of our vehicles !
5 #### Buy it it works . Used it on the road and helped w construction and accident reporting . Would recommend totally friends .
5 #### I 've been playing for nearly 50 years ( 45 professionally ) . I went through lots of different picks , changing different thicknesses , sizes , materials etc . Always felt there was something not quite right . Until I bought my first Delrins . I 've tossed all the others . I use the .96 's . I do mostly theatre work at this point and it is not uncommon for me to have to switch between several guitars ( acoustics and electrics ) , banjos , ukes , mandolins , what have you during a show . The Delrin is the only plectrum ( I will use metal fingerpicks or my fingernails , too ! ) I use .
5 #### Not much to say about this case other than it is fantastic ! My phone fits securely yet is easy to get out . The magnetic catch is much nicer than the velcro strap I had on my previous case , I can pull my phone out without making a lot of noise . The case also has belt loops if I were to be looking for the extra security that would offer . I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone .
5 #### Love the size of these binoculars . Always take them to baseball and basketball games . Their size makes them easy to carry around .
5 #### Works great . Was a just what I needed no problem with it . Price was right .Easy to use would buy more if and when I need them .
5 #### Works just as you would expect . On par with anything from radio shack , but much cheaper .
5 #### These are the cables you need to connect the XLR outputs to powered monitors . Perfect length .
4 #### I took the tip off and glued it to my finger on the glove . Now I do n't need to take off the gloves to answer a call or switch a song .
5 #### I use this to boost my Blacstar LT drive pedal or to add more grit to the drive channel . Sounds decent and original as a drive sound . As a stand alone pedal it gives you that warm creamy tube tone .
3 #### Do n't get made because you bought a $ 18 case or bumper for a phone that could cost 20 times the price to replace . If you need something temporary so you do n't scratch your phone then it 's ok . If you 're looking for long term protection you better buy more or look for something better . I liked the bumper at first but the corners were too tight for an anti - glare screen . It keeps lifting the screen cover up and make a bubble on the screen . I 'm moving to a better phone case . Hope you find this helpful before buying . Look for the post by Icsmd about " how to fix your buttons " you will not have the stiff buttons . Great post Icsmd .
5 #### Well made and solid . Too small for my needs . Would hold one camera with 18 - 55 zoom lens , plus one regular ( not zoom or telephoto ) lens , plus a small flash , plus small paraphernalia . I 'm returning it to get a bigger one -- much bigger . :)
1 #### Not even close to fitting my guitar . sorry : ( maybe my ukelele ? not recommended . Said they would replace this , not recieved in over a month .
1 #### There are those that love coated strings and those that do n't so this is just my opinion . I put a set of these on my vintage Ovation . These strings sound coated and the Martin SP 's I was using sound so much better . Plus after just one week of play there 's material flaking off the strings . If you want a really good sounding acoustic string that 's treated to last month to 3 months that does n't have a coated string then try Martin Lifespan 's . I love Lifespan but wo n't be buying anymore Elixirs .
3 #### I 'm returning this item because it uses a micro , not mini , USB connector . Every accessory I have uses mini - USB including my cell phone . As a result , I have tons of mini - USB chargers including standard USB cables . This headset is not compatible with them . Keeping this unit charged will be a pain , so it 's going back .
5 #### works just as good as the turtle wax lens restoration kit , but you get about 3x more polish and its cheaper !
5 #### Product arrived quickly , and as with all the Belkin products I 've purchased in the past , it works flawlessly as expected .
5 #### for the price of this winder / cutter its awesome , if it were made with a harder plastic would have been perfect !
5 #### Newest vehicle did not have these ... in my opinion they should be standard equipment on all cars / strucks ... but I love them ... easy to install !
5 #### I like to fit and use me and I just love the colors .
1 #### Waste of money . Worked for maybe 2 weeks . What can you expect for the price though ?
5 #### Just what I needed for my new printer that ( ridiculously ) is sold without the necessary cable ! ! ! Ca n't beat the price !
5 #### Great case , durable and color is exactly what you see . No worries if you purchase this case .
5 #### works great on my tabletops to stop rust and aloow easy wood movments ! ! ! highly recommend . I got 2 that should last me about 2 - 300 YEARS did n't realize how much is in the can lol
3 #### I found that this product , while very good overall , is a little tricky to put on your iPhone . Unfortunately , I got a couple of air bubbles under my cover and since there is only one screen cover you do n't get a second change . So I recommend making sure that you understand how to apply the cover before unpealing anything .
5 #### I 've used these several times , and they are reliable . They 're very sturdy and hold cars up just fine .
4 #### I 'm a gardener ; these will come in handy when working with drip irrigation systems .
5 #### I bought it so that I could listen to talk radio shows at night and leave my computer on down beside my bed .
4 #### Was looking for a good pop filter that did not break my pocket . Yes i m cheap , but with this economy I watch what I buy . The pop filter does its main job , to keep unwanted pops from being heard . Do not place in .5 inches away from the mic and expect no pop sound , make sure to use it correctly . I rate it a 4 because it does its job and its a basic pop filter . If you 're goal is to buy looks , then music ai n't your thing .
4 #### Overall this is a solid bag , but the front does not open as far down as the picture would indicate , making it a bit tough getting things in and out . For now I 'm OK with it , but will likely be trying out other options in the future .
4 #### Battery does extend the life of my Samsung S5 , but not by as much as I would have hoped . Normal battery lasts about 5 hours , while this battery lasts about 7 hours with normal use . Battery and case is very bulky and adds a lot more weight than one would imagine Update : Customer service was helpful and sent me out a new battery and it works quite a bit better . With light use I can now go up to 2 full days without a charge .
5 #### Do as the manual says , lube them up every so often , and these will work like a charm . I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button , and taking a chip out of the binding . The black ones work well with most finishes , and it works with most straps , as long as the ends are n't ridiculously thick . Inside of the box , it came with 2 screw sizes . One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal . No biggie however , as most straps are adjustable , so just adjust for the change in strap position , and you 're golden !
5 #### Let just start off by saying that I have tried the Kindle and although an OK hardware device , the interface was terrible . It felt like the early days of the internet , with textual interfaces , underlined words , fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate , and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device . We returned it within 3 days . Next we tried the original Nook Black&White , and interface was much better , but the screen had poor contrast . ( not the nice Pearl screen as the Kindle has ) Enter Nook Touch . WOW . This thing has a top notch interface ... they totally put their minds and heart into this one ... it is PERFECT . Touchscreen makes a world of a difference , and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store , personal library , and more . On - screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen , and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE . The screen is the new Pearl , so it looks just as good as the Kindle , with the added benefit of touchscreen ! The size ? PERFECT ! Not too big , not too small . Very thin . Well built . Feels durable . All I can say is this is finally the ereader I 've been waiting for ... excellent battery life , good Pearl screen , touchscreen , and perfect size . To boot , the price is dead on ! $ 139 with Wifi . If it gets stolen , I am buying another one immediately !
5 #### my son liked this alot and was upset when he lost the phone with this mirror screen , it was nice for him
5 #### I burn a lot of dvd 's and I noticed I started getting lots of skips and stalls of different movies . I ordered this little cleaner and just put it in the dvd burner and followed the instructions and it fixed all my skips . Most people do not know that you should clean your dvd after a few hours of playing or burning DVD 's . I am going to buy a lot of these to give at Christmas time !
5 #### It fits very snug and slides off easily . It secures the strings down extremely well so you do n't get any buzzing or unwanted tones .
5 #### I have looked for this thing in every store that I came across and could not find it . I came to this website as a last resort and booyah ! I found it . Now I can keep all of my discs cleaned and well preserved .
4 #### Works great in the cars just like its big brother .
5 #### Just what I 've always needed for my digital photo frame ... Love Mini Disks !
5 #### Love them . Polyweb is where it 's at , better than the nanowebs . That extra coating makes it easier to play and more durable . They sound fantastic .
4 #### hey , they 're sticks ! i 'm not really a drummer so i do n't know much about drum sticks , but they look good feel good and they arrived sooner than expected . I have no complaints .
4 #### I used this to change the oil in our jetskis back when we had them . Made it possible for me to change it myself and not have to pay a ton for a dealer to do it . The two flaws that stand out to me ( and prevent me from giving full five stars ) are the very small tube which makes the evacuation project slower and the fact that the top vacuum pump is not permanently attached . There is already a spout to dumb out the oil on the side . Why have the pump not attached ? It just makes it more difficult to keep the pump from loosing vacuum .
5 #### Got this to install in the glove box on my Kawasaki Concours . Simple to install , unobtrusive and does n't take up hardly any room , works great . and you ca n't beat the price .
5 #### THIS LIGHTER WORKS GREAT ! ! EASY STEP IN MAKING IT WORKS ! ! ! GREAT IDEA FOR SMOKERS FOR THERE CAR , , SPECIALLY WHEN U FORGET TO HAVE A LIGHTER , , SHIPPIN WAS FAST ! ! WOULD RECOMEND FOR SMOKER ! ! WIND PROOF , , AND THIS THING HEATS UP FAST ! ! !
4 #### Belkin makes a great product . This is a great solution to those that need a usb extension cord . Belkin products are good and reliable . This is a good buy as well because if you walk into comp usa or best buy , you are going to spend up to 30.00 dollars for the same cord of a different make .
5 #### This is one of those devices that you do n't know you need until you have it . Between using our phones for personal and business , and also having our kids play games , we find that we ca n't make it through the day without charging our phone . And since we 're always on the go , the iTorch has been the perfect accessory for keeping our devices charged and ready to go . Usually when we take long trips with our friends and family , someone is always asking for a wall charger and then they have to find an outlet to use . Now we can just keep this in our bag and plug our phone in and keep going . It does come with a red laser pointer and flashlight , which are cool features . I have n't used the laser pointer for anything practical yet , but the flash light has been useful more than I had expected . This is also a very small and slick looking device . It has caught the attention of many passer byers and it 's very easy to tote around . This does not come with a wall charger though , just 2 USB cables and a carry bag . If you have a phone or any other mobile device that charges via USB , you need this !
4 #### This brush is non - metal and thus can be used to clean the long thin tubing of a trombone without fear of scratching the surfaces . If you are a trombone player , you really must clean your instrument periodically . There are several reports you can find on people suffering from upper - respiratory infections caused by a dirty trombone . The inside of the inner slide portion starting at the mouthpiece gets a shower of food bits , saliva , etc . as you play . Microorganisms can live inside this slide -- it is warm and humid in this slide after you stop playing -- and some of those could cause disease ! This is a gentle and effective cleaner . The first time I cleaned my instrument , I found not too much in the larger bell or ascending side of the slide , but the descending portion below the receiver was FILTHY . There was a gray - slime that just coated this brush when it came out . I was nearly gagging thinking about every time I was doing those rapid slide motions that we do to make sure the lube is good realizing that the " exhale " backing up the mouthpiece was passing over this gunk and shooting into my face ! Yuck . Buy one and use it well . I am not sure how durable this will be as it is new , so I 'm holding back a star to " wait and see " so clearly " I like it " but I 'm not sure that " I love it " yet .
5 #### After all the whining I saw about these picks , was a little hesitant but bought them anyway . It does n't help that Amazon puts " Most popular " posters above " Most recent " so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product . I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each . So I got my full order . In addition , I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop . They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard . I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes . These are by far my favorite picks . The feedback is good and they 're stiff enough to strike clear tones . A winner to me .
5 #### I you have prize guitars these are a great investment .
2 #### This product : * was comfortable * functioned as advertised * had good battery life * was loud enough * had good outgoing sound ( based on comments of those who called ) * was FRAGILE -- the stem between the battery compartment and earpiece broke The poor durability is my biggest concern . If it only lasts a few months , it 's a poor value at more than $ 80 .
1 #### I bought this hoping to play my Dreamcast without using the rf connector it came with . Well the cable did n't even work .
5 #### I did not use the polish or wax in this kit , I only used the oxidation remover . I used a random orbital to prevent any ' burn ' that an amateur like me can accidentally cause . It went on fairly easy , and came off pretty easy though a clean bonnet every 6sqft makes it easier . I finished with Star Brite Premium Marine Polish and my RV looks like new !
3 #### Works ok , but is pricey , Can find substitutes much cheaper
1 #### This item does not fit the htc evo . Everytime I put it in my case it comes off the side . This item is ultra generic
5 #### This simple product attaches in minutes and stops the bike rack wiggle on the bumper of our RV . Takes a crescent wrench to install in about the time it will take you to read this review .
5 #### I had a convex mirror on my boat but still had blind spots on both sides that compromised safety in the busy channel I frequent . This mirror is actually 3 separate mirrors . Once you 've adjusted the center mirror as you would the rear view mirror on a car you can then adjust the two side mirrors individually as they are mounted on their own ball sockets . All of the adjustments are somewhat stiff but that 's a good thing as the adjustments stay in place even when bouncing through some chop . Another thing I like is the simple windshield mounting bracket that has a big knob for easy repositioning on the window frame . The bracket has a generous opening to clamp over any windshield frame . The only time you 'll need a screwdriver is to set the angle of the mirror to the bracket which should be a one time setting . With such an easy bracket the mirror can be switched from an above the windshield position to the lower position easily . Well worth the money !
5 #### I am a beginner drummer and I received this pedal as a gift in Jan 2010 . I have been using it only for a week or so in my practicing . This is my first upgrade to a decent pedal from the student - grade cheap pedal I used before . The most notable and desirable attributes I can already see are quiet operation and adjustability . The drive mechanism is absolutely noiseless , there is no clanking or other noises from the chain , hinges , cam , spring or any other part . The pedal has quite a few possible adjustments which can be effected very easily and quickly using a standard drum key or no tool at all : the footboard leverage has three positions , the cams cam be exchanged to any of 4 cam inserts included in the box , each with a different shape / feel , the footboard 's traction rubber inserts can be re - arranged / removed , the footboard height has three settings , the beater angle has infinite adjustability and it can be adjusted independently from footboard height . Additionally , the usual side - access hoop clamp and beater height adjustments are included , as is a nice carrying case with double zippers and two pockets and 3 allen keys , a drum key and 4 cam inserts .
3 #### If you 're looking for a pair that you do n't want to lose sleep over losing or having your kid break , these are it . Having 20/15 vision , I find it 's not easy keeping focus , because I have to change both the focus and the diopter on one of the lenses to bring an image into clear focus .
5 #### Nice and big . I use it to set a " take out " container of dinner on my dashboard when I have to eat on the job . It 's doing the job just fine . My food has n't spilled yet !
1 #### like others have said , this thing caused my VCR player to stop working . i want my money back . if the quality changed so mcuh Amazon needs to make that clear . I am noticing that MANY products which were high quality just a few years ago have been shipped oofshore for manufacturing - they end up with high ratings because so many 4 - 5 stars exist over the yrs of high quality production . it will take as many 1 - 2 stars to even make these tiems come up as an ave 3 stars . thanks
5 #### OMG I love this phone , is the best thing ever . I 'm a Samsung girl now since I live in the states , but for other countries where you access is a little limited this phone is the best . I had such a great signal and the phone lasted me forever .
5 #### Used this over the Klasse all in one on my RV . Went on easily , buffed out easily . Follow instructions and apply in the shade . Hope it lasts all year !
5 #### Great little tablet I bought one a yr ago I think ( 16 gb ) and I love it ! ! ! ! never had any problems with it , infact I got another one today I bought both of mine at Walmart though ....... today I got the 32 gb and It was on sale for $ 125 ! ! ! That 's less then what I paid for my first one ( last yr I paid $ 179 for the 16 gb )
3 #### Goes on easily , fits snugly , and all the holes align correctly . The S - Pen can be removed and inserted with ease . Textured rubber on the sides allows for a firm grip . That all said , this is a very thin polyurethane - like case with very little elasticity . I doubt it provides a lot of shock absorption in the event of a dropped phone . I 'm pessimistic that it will offer much protection , but I guess I 'll find out .
1 #### I purchased two of these and let me tell you stay away from them . Let 's see first off the quality of the sound really bit , one of my kids toys headset sounded a whole lot better . One of them , within the first two weeks , snap the earpiece , you know the thing that goes over your ear . Same thing happened with the other one month later . I 'd go with something else like maybe Motorola ..
5 #### Nice quality locking pin . I use it in the snow and salt and it functions perfectly . Still looks good after a couple years use .
5 #### I live a third or more of my life in a cube - farm , so being able to look over your shoulder without turning around is a God - send . These little babies fit the bill .
3 #### This case was really nice . But just did n't hug or protect my phone like I like . It was all stretched out :0 (
5 #### Bought this at advance auto parts and immediately my transmission in my gmc started shifting like new it no longer kicks me in the back when it downshifts and upshifts are like silk
1 #### I 've already discontinued wearing it after just a few weeks as the sound quality is terrible and teh customers I call are constantly saying " They ca n't hear me . " The plug also is shorting out and creates static on the line .
5 #### I 've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms , but this one works . Once secured in place it stays there . Easy to place in the truck and easy to remove . I 'd buy it again . Outstanding price .
5 #### Great strings ! , Looking for something with more " body " than 0.9 strings , but softer ( feel ) than 0.10 . Arrived in time and good packaged . Thanks a lot !
5 #### This is a nice external drive . Just plug it in and go . I got it because the cd drive quit working in my laptop .
5 #### The Evans Pedal Patch will work for you great .. It will keep your mass drum head from getting worn and nasty .. I cheap buy and it works excellent ..
2 #### These headphones are muddy , muffled , and have very little variation between highs , lows and mid range . Used only for listening to the news , or something where quality and clarity of sound are not of any importance . Thumbs down .
5 #### The best I 've used . Great sound for my Martin D-18
5 #### I Did not purchase this item from amazon.com but from my local music store . If you are after a high quality , durable and adaptable L arm then buy this . It is capable of holding a tambourine , jam block , cow bell etc with ease and strength .
2 #### The plastic pry tools barely lasted one use , and I needed to use them multiple times to take apart and repair my phone . In the end I was using my fingernails to do the job because the plastic tips broke and chipped with one use . I did n't use the screwdrivers because they ended up being the wrong ones for my phone . At least the price was cheap .
5 #### This is one great pick , I play a lot of fast leads and this cuts the sonic butter like a hot knife . Its quite comfortable to hold and play with , I noticed the Big Stubby 3.0 ended up giving me a strain on my right thumb , so I started looking for a replacement . I m using it for metal rythm and lead playing .
5 #### I use mine for homemade penetrating fluid , I work on a lot of rusty vehicle 's . the store bought stuff just do n't work enough.(might need pliers to tighten hose my would n't stay by hand ) .
1 #### The flexible hose was plugged on one end . Never seen this on a grease gun ? ? ? Had to buy another hose to be able to use this item . Would have dealt with seller / manufacturer , but that would take too long . Update : I did pick up another hose for ~$9 and the grease gun worked OK . Would have been better off buying a grease gun at my local auto parts store which had them for the same proce .
5 #### Kit works well , be careful not to over oil as it is easily done .
5 #### I 've used Martin Silk & Steel since I started playing both 6 and 12 string guitars . Just an excellent string set .
5 #### I feel like a wimp using extra light strings on my acoustic , but it 's helpful for me , particularly when playing barr chords . The strings sound good too . Good tone and resonance . I do n't feel as if I lost anything going from light strings . It 's too early to comment on life . Time will tell .
5 #### They 're mud flaps . Used different install hardware . Easily trimmed for custom installations .
5 #### A must have for the home mechanic . Wish I had bought these years ago . Solid construction , a steal for 20bucks
3 #### bow always fall off . cones with small clue but you ca n't keep gluing back on . glue stinks not recommend for people with small baby because smell is to loud
5 #### Now when we get the fever for cow bell , we bring this out , and we finally have enough cow bell .
4 #### Did n't want to go to Harbor Freight and run the chance of having jack stands fail ... these seemed like the better option . They seem like solid pieces , and I have nothing bad to say . They held up the front end of my 4K+ pound vehicle with ease without creaking or complaining .
5 #### Awesome tach . Works exactly as it is supposed to and very accurate . Price was good . Would recommend this product ! Item arrived ahead of time .
5 #### I have an iphone 4 . My car has bluetooth but no navigation system . I have a Garmin Nuvi , but using my iphone 's navigation is much easier than taking out and booting up the Nuvi . Additional plus is that anytime I get a call , it rings into the car , but I have no idea who 's calling . With the iphone in the cradle , I can see who 's calling me . This cradle fits nicely in the vent . I leave the cradle in all the time , without removing it . Placing iphone into the cradle is quick . Overall , I would recommend to iphone owners .
5 #### This is the best Bluetooth . It 's quite comfortable and I can wear it all day long without even noticing I have it on . The sound is crisp and clear and I would n't have any other one .
5 #### Best leather cleaner and conditioner that I 've used . Bought several from Amazon - prices are much better than local auto stores or similar .
4 #### This holds my iPhone 5 perfectly in the upholder of my Honda Odyssey . It 's sung , easy release and has fold down fingers that hold it into position .
5 #### This review is intended as a supplment to my earlier post ( dated August 3 , 2001 ) . I found a way to use the Palm Keyboard as a cool phone directory . At work , I now attach my Palm to the keyboard -- and leave it on my desk not far from the phone . To look up a number , I simply press the " phone " button on my Palm ( like I normally would ) , type in the name ( or just the first few letters ) -- and hit " enter . " The number immediately appears on screen . I no longer need to tap , write or scroll down the screen to find an entry . And typing it is usually faster and more accurate . I 'm now more productive at work . And looking up phone numbers -- even for persons with whom I dread speaking -- is no longer the chore that it used to be ! I think a better name for this product would be , " The Palm Phone Directory Keyboard . " What do you think ?
5 #### The sound quality is good and the base is also good . I would recommend this product to anybody .
5 #### I got my screen protector just after one week of waiting . I followed the instructions , which require peeling off a bottom layer of plastic , attaching and smoothing the sticky film to the screen , and peeling off a top protective layer . I the application and smoothing went so well , I thought I made a mistake . I forgot to take off the final layer , and ending up ruining the screen protector , but I repeated the application with another protector , and lo and behold , near perfect application again . It looks as if there is no film on the screen . I 'll see how this holds up over time , but I am so amazed at the application . As long as the screen is clean , the application process will be a cinch . I would definitely order this product again .
5 #### This is a pretty great product for the price . Getting all that is included is very helpful , and gets you started quickly .
5 #### Sound great to me . They do have a distinctive ( good ) sound , got ta hear it for yourself
5 #### I purchased the Wilson Booster and the cradle that it came with just did n't work . So I purchased this Gooseneck Suction Cup and Mount and it worked like a charm . No more falling off the window , while going down the road ... Would so Highly Recommend this product ! ! !
3 #### When I 'm bored , I like to play a lot of the so - called " cowboy chords " and kind of strum along to music . I 've experimented with a few different picks and styles of guitars ( acoustic , hollow body , and electric ) . These days , my go - to strumming guitar is my Gretsch hollow body . Anyhow , I wanted something that had did n't add too much of that scraping sound when strumming . I thought that I wanted some thin picks for that purpose , and actually that probably was n't wrong , but 0.38 m is a little too thin . I gave one to my friend as a joke , and he tore the pick in half with almost no effort . 0.38 mm is also a little thin to be playing notes / solos . However , I do like the shape of these picks and they do feel really good . At some point , I am going to buy some that are thicker because they are a nice fill - in item for an Amazon order , and let 's face it , who out there is n't constantly losing picks .
4 #### Fantastic product for the price . Just as good as any other hard case out there and a fraction of the price . Arrived on time .
5 #### This product went on nicely over the silver colored Rust Bullet and left a shiny hard black finish which should repel moisture well . Use a breathing ventilator , however , as the fumes are strong .
3 #### Worked but not as well as hoped . Used to re - attach a leather door panel in a 2003 VW Passat . Did the prep , followed the directions , but the adhesion was not that great .
5 #### I use these light guage strings because I have arthritis . Makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again . And if you buy them in a 10 pack , you save a bunch of money !
5 #### Well , the darn printer only fits in my office on the FAR side of the desk from the PC . The local computer store wanted THREE TIMES this price for a 10 ft cable ; I figured I could wait a few days ( very few , as it turned out ) to save a few bucks . Works fine ...
5 #### As a new - entry audiophile - to - be , I spent a lot of time researching headphones . I primarily use them with Spotify or other digital music sources . While these headphones do n't add to the music , they provide the truest Uncolored representation and allow me to adjust the music via equalizer . Super comfortable and durable . Love these cans .
5 #### I ca n't find this speed film easily , so this was great . I use it allot photographing my grandkids activities .
4 #### These screen protectors are a perfect fit ! Just wish I would 've known that there was only 1 per package ! ! Otherwise I would 've ordered more ! ! And next time I will ! ! !
5 #### I guess this is a bit redundant given the thousands of positive reviews . I bought these because the cost next to nothing and the reviews were fantastic . I 'm here to agree . These really sound fantastic ! They are comfortable because they are very light and do n't press hard on my ears . I 'm thinking about taking up jogging and I 'll probably use these although I 'm a bit reluctant to get sweat on them even though they are so inexpensive to replace . If you like high fidelity and are pleased to get a great deal , get these .
5 #### WORKS GREAT IN MY Z - PLUS . Good , clean butane . It 's the only butane that keeps the Zippo Z - Plus from clogging .
4 #### Great tone . Fuller than a glass slide . Very heavy , though , if you are playing with it on your pinky . You have to really press your ring finger against the side of it to maintain good contact with the strings . I have big hands , and did n't think the weight would be an issue , but it is . The weight is part of why this slide has great tone , though , so it is worth figuring out how to make this thing work .
5 #### great way to display your axe and keep it out of the case . I have always felt that when your instrument is in a case it gives you an excuse not to practice it . Use this and keep it out
5 #### I bought this bracket in order to work with my 700 - R4 GM transmission with my Holley 670 Street Avenger carburetor . At first , I thought it was crazy to spend that much when they make cheaper universal brackets . DO NOT use a universal bracket . They are cheap , and flimsy . This product is SOLID . It is very sturdy , matches up to the carburetor perfectly and does not bend , sway , move , etc . Works perfect ! ! !
5 #### YOU COULD PAY THREE TIMES THE PRICE , AND STILL RECEIVE THE SAME QUALITY . THESE ARE PREMIUM SCREEN PROTECTORS THAT FIT PERFECTLY FOR THE LG RUMOR TOUCH . EASY TO PUT ON AS WELL ! UV PROTECTION TOO !
4 #### Unless you can convince yourself that you need the features of higher models ( such as the 430EX ) , this is a great flash . It is very simple - turn it on , take the picture , turn it off . It seems to be a little less harsh than the popup flash on my Rebel XT . it also claims to be a little more powerful than the popup flash . Finally , I have lens hoods on a few of my lenses . Thus , the popup flash often creates a " shadow " . This flash takes care of that problem . If you fall somewhere between being a clueless photographer who has no idea what this flash might do for you , but are short of an overeager hobbyist who might want to fiddle around with more advanced features , then this is a good flash . It does not swivel or tilt , but I do n't care about that . I mainly wanted a little more power than my popup / builtin flash and I wanted to get above my lens hoods to prevent shadowing . This flash works for me . I give it 4 stars b / c there seems to be a notable reduction in light output if you take rapid fire shots .
1 #### THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT J AND R. YOU ENTER YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS : " PLACE YOUR ORDER " AND THE CART GOES TO " 0 " . REAL DRAG . i CALLED JANDR TWICE ABOUT REMOVING THIS PAGE FROM AMAZON BUT THEY SAID IT TAKES TIME .
4 #### These are Brother OEM tapes , so they should function flawlessly in their label printers . I 've found them to print sharply , bond securely to varied surfaces , and resist the weather very well - I 've used some on wood stakes as plant markers outdoors ! The one caution , after printing longer labels , stripping of the masking from the reverse makes great caution necessary to prevent the label sticking to itself .
5 #### EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AND FOR THE PRICE , IT 'S GREAT . TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT
5 #### I NEEDED THIS FOR MY HOME OFFICE . THE PRICE WAS RIGHT SO I TOOK A SHOT AND I AM SO GLAD I DID . IT WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED SO MUCH SO I HAVE BOUGHT THEM FOR MY HOME . THEY ARE TOUGH AND DURABLE GET THE JOB DONE . DO NOT LET THE PRICE SCARE YOU ITS WORTH IT
5 #### Love this foster . It is tall and I can wash bigger dished without any problem
4 #### The Yamaha FC3A foot pedal works as advertised , as I use it for my Yamaha MOXF8 with sounds that 's able to use half - pedaling ( Pre1 Full Concert Grand ) . You have a bit of travel on the pedal before it actually registers ( I have to go almost halfway down before I notice an effect ) , and the half - pedaling effect seems to go to a full pedal early ( Do n't hear much a difference between 3/4ths and fully depressed pedal ) . If there was a way to adjust the sensitivity on this pedal , I would definitely give it 5 stars . It 's well worth having one of these , especially if you have another pedal plugged in alongside it , though I would want to test one against the original Yamaha FC3 .
1 #### This came with high recommendation - however we were disappointed because the Bluetooth connection started dropping from mid - Feb , almost 15 days after the product return deadline ! Phone calls drop - off without a warning and it needs constant recharging . For the past 3 weeks , it stopped even recognizing our mobile devices and has now stopped working : does n't start even after charging it for 2 full days !
5 #### This oil is INCREDIBLE . I switched the oil injection on my vintage sled over to this oil , and it runs great . Hardly any smoke at all , and plugs come out clean when taking readings . I do n't think it leaves any deposits at all !
5 #### I love it . this is comfortable loud enough for me . its cute , the cord is not to long its just right and i just am satisfied with every thing about this .
5 #### the camera looks brand new . there was basically no scratches . On the product page it said it did n't come with batteries and it did come with them and they work . I was able to take pictures instantly when I received this camera . the camera even came with instructions on how to use it and a nice thank you letter =3 . it also came a lot faster then the shipping time said it would .
5 #### Best strings in the world ! ! I do n't use anything else .
5 #### I am an early childhood special education teacher , and I use this chime to signal group transitions , gain student attention , and a reminder to keep voices down . It produces a pleasant tone that my students love and respond to immediately . I highly recommend this product for teachers or anyone who might want to use it as a meditation aid .
5 #### I ve been using this product for years .... This was a great price ! Thanks !
5 #### Works great , the cord is too short so I bought an extension and it still works great . Worth the money .
4 #### This stuff does work , but it is a lot of work to buff out an entire RV even with an electric buffer . I have a 2001 30 ' class C minnie winnie and used about 1.5 bottles of the oxidation remover . There was enough polish and wax .
5 #### Fantastic undercoating . This product dries immediately and really adheres to metal .
1 #### This charger does not fit into my charging port very well , it wiggles and I feel like the tip does n't reach it and I have to mess with it to even get the light to come on and give power to charge my phone . Also it wo n't stay on for very long and then it goes out , making it completely useless .
5 #### Nice light in the sockets , generally works great , would have been 5 stars but onceeeee in a while I have to unplug and plug the unit back in . Might just be a finicky dc socket on my benz ... Ill change it to five stars if it survives another year of my use . :) UPDATE : have had this for 2 years plus now ( about ) and it is still working great . So now it gets 5 stars instead of 4 ! Its a must have .
3 #### It 's alright . Not many functions but I guess it 'd be good for people who were n't really into CB . I upgraded to a Galaxy DX959 , much better .
5 #### Sounds great on my 2001 Chevy Malibu with the 3100 LG8 V6 .
5 #### I 've ordered these in 3 , 3.5 and 3.5 + ( that one was purchased by mistake ) . So far I 've had many good reeds from this batch . Wish Rue Lepic 's came in a 3.25 but a little touchup with the Ridenour Reed Emergency Room Kit fixes them ! For me better than Rico Reserve or Royals or V-12 's .
5 #### I have used one of these capos , a black one , for a long time . Wanting to have an extra one to pack in my jam - going bag , I chose this color -- and it 's great , much nicer than it looks in the photo . I 've put a beautiful Souldier strap ( Braveheart ) on my Collings , and it 's a pleasure to have a capo that complements my guitar and the strap .
5 #### Love these ! Sit very comfortably on my head , and sound great .
3 #### This is a specialized tool required for my yukon steering wheel . The tool performance was as expected .
5 #### I have three of these mounts on one wall with 32 " tvs on them . Very easy to install . Prevented thieves from taking my tvs when they broke in last year .
5 #### i learned later that New Trent actually has a very nice product line . I work on a Military Base as an instructor so I am constantly wearing out points and needing to charge my iPhone because my life is very mobile Mon - Fri . This external battery fit the bill perfectly to assist me on my weekly travels and instruction in the class room at work . Solid build quality and does what it is supposed to do Thank you Amazon Big Thanks to New Trent
4 #### awesome phone , but it has a few issues . positives : great , vivid , quick responding screen , very fast , great quality , thin negatives : GPS does n't work . They say they have a fix that they will distribute soon , but they 've been saying that for a while and it still has n't shown up . battery life is a little annoying . Some apps try to access the GPS , then run the battery out in hours while they keep trying to find a GPS fix . The only way around the battery drain is to turn off GPS completely . I hope they fix it soon , because I would like to use the GPS features .
4 #### I got the product in good shape . Installation easy except it requires two person to connect the TV to the bracket .
5 #### Sits securely on the floor , holds the plugs in securely , plugs spaced apart smartly to utilize every device , electricity distributed out evenly , looks great on the floor . What more can I ask for .
5 #### I 'm giving it 5 stars , BUT , I think the Velcro arrangement to fasten under the side mirrors is crappy . It is n't going to stay closed in any wind or even just sitting there on the van . A much better idea would have been a couple of grommets that you could put a bungee or piece of rope through and tie it securely . Otherwise the cover is ok . The first one I ordered said it had the cutouts for the side mirrors , but it did n't when I got it opened . I reordered and I think the material quality on this second cover is just a bit lighter than the other one . Oh , well , my son liked it so much he 's ordering one for his van :)
5 #### Bought this to use on my jeep wrangler . Mounted an Everhart 3 ' double wound antenna on it and it 's just right . The spring is stiff enough that it does n't wobble in the wind , but it will give if you run though the trees or up under your garage door . I like it alot .
5 #### I 've been using the Kensington car mount for about a week and it is flawless . I know others have complained that the arm shakes - hey , what would you expect an extension arm to do ? We live in a flat area , so it is fine and besides , I do n't spend all my time looking at my phone while driving , and that is why I can write this review today . There is a 3/8ths of an inch thick cushion holding your device in place which makes it easy for your phone or pod to be quickly released . I 'm sure the mount can be used for many other devices , not just an iphone or pod . It seems to open up enough to hold a razzleberry phone . Pros : A ) highly adjustable ARM which can be bent so that your phone faces you while the suction mount is out of view . Arm is long enough so that you can set your phone exactly where you want it to be . B ) Phone comes out easily by turning the phone to its side and replaced by using the same method . C ) Turns to side for widescreen view - clicks in place and easily resets to the upright position . D ) Suctions well to a " Clean Windshield " Cons : Well , if i need to come up with one , I would ask for the base which supports the phone from the bottom was about 1/4 to 3/8 longer . It 's not all that important .
5 #### I 've tried several soaps for cleaning my various K&N air filters , but I always find myself going back to their Power Kleen . It just works well , and when you can buy it by the gallon , this is a great option . I have 4 vehicles with K&N air filters and a gallon will last me 2 - 3 years .
4 #### Not as pictured - does not have the screen cover , but for one penny , what can you complain about ? The shipping cost was 60x than the cost of the product - COMPLAINT ! Do n't understand why it 's advertised as a " hard case " , because it is RUBBER - plain and simple . If I should ever drop my BB 8830 I would hope that it would bounce back into my hands - I ca n't for the world see how this cover could protect it . It just looks cool and probably protets it from scratches and very , very , very , very short drops / falls < 1 ft .
3 #### Used this one and the pumping handle started bending and I am not sure how much longer its gon na last . Worked very well in taking the oil out of my waverunner .
4 #### I bought these for a friend to replace the headphones that my daughter cut with a set of scissors . I would not have bought them for myself , but they are a good set . I could not give them five stars because the set I did buy for myself are much better quality than these .
5 #### I was constantly having trouble with blurry photos when using my 70 - 300 m zoom lens , even with using a tripod . So I scoured the internet for tips on how to remedy this problem , and came across many articles recommending using a remote switch because the camera would still shake a little from the pressure of pushing down on the shutter button on your camera . I am getting excellent results with my photos now using this switch .
4 #### Works as intended and is great for the price . Adjustable sub frequency is nice . Feedback button lets you know what frequencies are feeding back by blinking EQ lights . Good for beginners or someone looking for something simple to adjust their sound .
2 #### This somehow got 4.5 stars . I have no idea how . It is cheap plastic , and looks like it will break at the slightest provocation . I dare not use it for a phone as it is advertised for . It can be used for keys .
5 #### This switch is a terrific value . I bought this switch for use at home to connect three computers in my home - office . I am very happy with my choice . The switch supports video resolutions up to 1920x1440 . In the past , I found other low - cost KVM switches show noticeable image deterioration above 1024x768 . There is a easy - to - use button on the device to switch among your machines . LED 's on top tell you which machine you have selected . You can also switch between machines using the keyboard . There are three KVM switching modes via keyboard : Switch directly : ... Go to machine N : Alt , Ctrl , Shift , { 1 2 3 or 4 } , Enter Auto - Scan ( 3 second interval ): ... Begin Auto - scan : Alt , Ctrl , Shift , 0 , Enter . ... Stop auto - scan : Spacebar Up / down mode ( Make it easy to quickly switch between machines ): ... Begin Up / down mode : Alt , Ctrl , Shift , 0 , Enter ... Go to previous machine : Left - Shift ... Go to next machine : Right - Shift ... Stop up / down mode : Spacebar Unlike some KVM switches , you hit Alt , Ctrl , and Shift in order , one - at - a - time . You do n't " chord " the keys together . ( This actually is a benefit in my case -- I use the Emacs editor in Linux , and my previous " cheapie " KVM switch had a Ctrl - Alt - key combination command that conflicted with the editor . ) The ProConnect does n't have an On - Screen - Display that tells you the name of the selected computer . I use OSD - enabled switches for work in the datacenter ; but , given this unit 's price , not having OSD is an acceptable limitation for the home - office .
2 #### Overall the Incipio Ultralight cases are pretty good . However there is a pretty glaring flaw with these cases . I like them because they protect the phone while being minimally intrusive . However because they 're a slim fit case the area around the upper left corner of the phone near the volume control is very weak . Every one of these cases I 've had broke in the same spot . This aside the cases are very sleek , slim and work great with the phone . The chrome one is very shiny which is hard to tell from the product pictures . Although the pictures look more like a dull or brushed chrome it 's certainly a mirror finish . These cases are great because of the slim fit but you sacrifice some durability especially near the volume controls . * * * UPDATE * * * * This case has since broken in the aforementioned place . My wife pulled it out of her purse , it got snagged on something and then SNAP . So keep in mind this design weakness when purchasing . They 're great looking cases but ours lasted less than 2 months .
5 #### Got this to use with the Behringer compressor I ordered with this . They are not indicated as compatible but it worked great ! Price was right . I already own two and had no problems . Quiet . No hummmmm . Buy it if you need a wall wart .
5 #### Ever wonder why your guitar never has the sweet woody sounds like the old recordings of Simon and Garfunkel , Jim Croce , James Taylor , Dan Fogelberg , Harry Chapin , Gordon Lightfoot , Arlo Guthrie , or the Grateful Dead ? It 's because NONE of those artists used phosphor bronze strings for their recordings ( and definitely no coated strings either ) ! No they used 80/20 's to get their amazing sounds , and John Pearse makes the best 80/20 strings in the world ! Bright and sparkling when first put on your guitar , and then within a week they mellow to warm and clear perfection . And then that sound lasts and last . Try these strings . Give them 2 weeks and you 'll be hooked on them for a lifetime !
5 #### I switched to Vandoren from Rico Royal after a few years of playing . The price can be shocking to a beginning player . But you really do get your money 's worth . A Rico box of 10 might include 3 - 5 good reeds , the rest you end up just throwing away . But in a box of Vandoren , having one bad one is less likely to happen . In 3 boxes , I 've only had one I had to toss . The quality of these reeds is also way better than Rico ; they really help produce a richer tone . Buying them on Amazon allows me to buy them at a more affordable price and still get my top quality reeds . Would definitely recommend this to all clarinet players .
2 #### If you are a Macintosh user , you should know of a very important limitation of all Linksys hubs & switches , including this one : This switch will NOT route AppleTalk information on your network . What that means is that if you are a Macintosh user who is trying to use file sharing via AppleTalk , or if you have an older AppleTalk printer ( such as the older line of HP LaserJet printers ) , you will be out of luck with this switch ... or any Linksys hub / switch . Besides the lack of Macintosh AppleTalk support , this switch seems to work just fine .
5 #### There are something special about these strings . They ring so bright and beautiful . I absolutely love them for my fenders . I honestly do n't use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele . They 're gorgeous sounding , especially when new .
5 #### My son uses strings all the time and he tried this set and like it .
4 #### Much easier to use cleaner in this bigger bottle without the top pump sprayer
5 #### I have used these since I was young and they have a great sound
5 #### Works great for a great price ! Definitely used the heck out of it in a sunrise session .
5 #### Quiet and comfortable . I use these in my studio when I record audiobooks and they are very good . They feel solid and do n't get in my way or make my ears too hot . They 're great !
1 #### Simply put , these earbuds gives the worst , tinniest , least dynamic sound I 've ever heard in my life . It seems like Koss tried to actively develop lousy sounding earbuds because I ca n't imagine a beta tester using them and not saying they 're garbage . They are uncomfortable . The connection sucks . They are temperamental . Jiggling them causes the sound to sometimes drop out in one ear . The perfect trifecta : I bought them from Radio Shack , used them for a day , and promptly tossed them in the garbage . Do yourself a favor - look elsewhere .
5 #### I placed this item next to my volume POTS for easy access to picks in a live scenario . Works magic and its even faster than a mic stand clip . This will be on all my live guitars .
5 #### I installed these in a 1997 E450 Superduty Ford bus . The stock sealed beams were abysmal at night . This kit fit in place of the sealed beam with no issues . Very simple swap . My only watch out is to be sure to push the rubber grommet on the back all the way down on the bulb 's prongs . It takes a little force but it 's not difficult . I thought about LED replacements but besides being less expensive and a reputable name brand . If a bulb does burn out they are easy to find in any auto store . I highly recommend these if you are using sealed beams still .
5 #### View objects with crystal clear clarity ! We have been using them to watch a family of eagles . It is amazing !
5 #### i got this one to house my IPhone with a Magpul Ballistic Case on my Maxped Lunada Gearslinger . It perfectly fits the Magpul / iPhone combo and snugly carries it . It attaches with a 3"tactie and places the phone on a very accessible place right on my chest . It is built to last , with a plastic clasp to further safeguard your phone . I will pick one up for every Maxped bag I have ( currently 3at the moment ) .
3 #### the quality seemed good but it just did n't last to normal wear I want to say it only lasted a few weeks before it was defective , cheap for the price do
5 #### Fit my 1958 Ludwig floor tom and greatly improved stability and projection . A little pricey , but a good investment for an old floor tom .
5 #### Seems well put together . Fit the spare tire on my van perfectly ( 275/65 R15 ... 28 " diameter ) I centered it on tire , and let it sit in the sun to heat up for 5 - 10 minutes and then cinched it up till it was nice and tight all around . Looks good and am very happy with it .
5 #### First of all , I use this as more of a 6 band EQ using the lower and highest more for LP and HP filters . The middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone . You can also use this as boost box , using the gain and volume sliders . The box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage , but I tend to set and forget . In reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful . -If you turn your gain way up , you will have hiss . Period , this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that I have been exposed to . Have a reason for upping your gain , if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp . -EQ is to ENHANCE your tone , not create it ! A Strat can not be made to sound like a Les Paul and vice versa . Your tone is made up of many , many variables . The resulting tone can be SHAPED or COLORED by adding or subtracting certain frequencies . That is the function of an EQ , nothing more . IT can range from dramatic to very subtle . Very small changes can have large effects . Small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics I am able to produce . -I tend to put the EQ in much later in my effect chain , but feel free to experiment .
5 #### This stuff works great . . . . . . . .. . . . .. .. .. . . MMmMmmMm m m m m m m m m
5 #### Top Motorcraft Product at half the normal price . What is n't there to love ? With dirty fuel causing so many issues with new fuel injected cars I consider it cheap insurance to replace these at half the recommended interval .
5 #### It works . Ford 2000 ford f250 . Do yourself a favor , but the disconnect took from the auto store do n't bother with the sharpie cap trick
5 #### Great strings , just a bit on the bright side for me .
5 #### They work , do n't tangle up bad , and pretty easy to work with .
5 #### I 've used Dunlops for years and I recently went to the .50 mm to lessen the pick noise when I 'm recording . It took a little getting used to these coming from a .73 mm but well worth the sound I 'm getting . Less clack with out loosing the attack . Dunlop Tortex have a great feel and when they are new the coating works really well to keep that pick from sliding in your hand . I 'd recommend these to anyone who is looking for great pick .
3 #### This pair of folding headphones has a lot going for it . They clamp to your head firmly without being uncomfortable . The pads move around to compensate for different shaped heads and ears , which is nice . They fold up into a little circle for easy storage , though the pouch they supply in which to store them is a * little * small for ease of storage . But onto the sound - highs are great , without tinniness , bass response is good without distortion . They 're no Bose cans - but at this price , they 're an AMAZING deal . EDIT * * - Be VERY careful with these - they are not rigidly constructed , and will break in half at the drop of a hat . If you 're looking for a pair of headphones to drop in your bag and go , do n't pick these . These will sit on your counter or shelf and as long as you do n't fling them about , will remain intact . But the fact that they 're designed as " portable " is very misleading . They WILL break .
5 #### Good covers I use for comb binding books and reports .
5 #### I have always used Linksys products and very good reliability from them . This is no exception as soon as I applied power and hooked up all my devices the unit performed without incident .
5 #### Work great I just added some 10 ft long boards from my local lumber yard and done ! Help up my riding tractor .
5 #### Tried an off - brand , Cherub . hated it -- cable broke where it goes into the housing , and it felt light and cheap . Bought this one by Yamaha . Love it . Works as it should . I have a Yamaha keyboard .
5 #### The ear buds that come with the iPhone do not stay in my ears . These are great because thy stay in & the clarify is great . And you can receive calls with them on . These are great ! I wear them at work all day .
4 #### It feels cheap and a bit too flexible , but for just over a dollar , I 'm not sure what I expected . I 'm do n't know about in - line pause buttons , but the mic on my headset works through these . The only issue is that the 3.5 mm cutout on my iPad case is particularly small , and I actually had to cut off a little more plastic off this ( easy with scissors or a razor blade ) . Once I did that , it worked . The seller I bought from ( cellularfactory ) also included a cheapo stylus - I wish they 'd not bother with useless things like that , and spend the money making the product I actually ordered a little higher quality .
4 #### The adapter works pretty well . Sometimes it has issues , where the speakers on the left front of the car stop working , but I think that 's just my old car . A good product that came very quickly .
5 #### I bought these for my car and the wife 's car too . The white illumination inside the car is really cool . I have had them for over a year now with no problems at all . The only thing I do n't like is that they are a bit expensive .
5 #### I 've been using this for years now . I move it from car to car all the time . The stick still works great , and I 've never had any issues .
3 #### It 's great if you need to quickly drop your hats , but not the other way around . I bought this drop clutch because it was cheap , and I was on a budget . Overall its build is solid , the only problem I have with it is having the clutch lock back into place .
5 #### I recently bought a bunch of picks of different gauges and materials for a shoot out . I think you have to see what kind of tone you are looking for - yes , even in a pick ( sorry guys ! - but for me , this material and gauge had a full sound , without being thin and the material feels best in the fingers . ( I previously used .63 gauge acetal Claytons .
2 #### This stopped working less than a month after I bought it and only used it as a secondary charger . What a shame - try another product .
5 #### this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer . great value for the price .
5 #### this case is lightweight , a very nice color , and perfect for storing 2 cards ( DL and CC ) in the back . some reviews said they could get more than that , but I could only get 2 cards in . That 's ok with me , because that 's all I usually carry . The area for cards is VERY snug , so there 's a very slight chance that your cards will come out . at least on mine . i 've had many people ask me where this came from and i 'm highly recommending this case .
4 #### Good strong spring and good strong materials . The only improvement I would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck . The protector needs to be longer . As the protector ages it slips off the end . If it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help .
4 #### The EZGrabber2 works well but it 's software is a little lack luster . I have software installed on my computer that works properly with my night vision so the EZgrabber works well to do what I needed .
5 #### I love these pedals . Inexpensive to purchase - easy to mod to your liking . This pedal received the gain and JCM mod . I will purchase more of these and will mod each and every one of them . This pedal is also good stock for a lead boost . Love this pedal .
5 #### Good price and good quality This was worth the money by far . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 .
5 #### Battery pack works , fits perfectly and cable / connector did n't present any issues during install .
1 #### I have used Maxell vcr head cleaners in the past that have something on the screen to let you know what is happening . This tape is about 10 seconds long , it 's nearly impossible to tell when it begins and ends so it 's very difficult to use . But the biggest problem is that it does n't clean or help the performance of the vcr !
4 #### This item was as advertised . It appears to be of good workmanship and quality . Would recommend to others for purchase .
5 #### Ordered this to replace grab handle that broke on 5th wheel - this was a perfect fit , no new holes needed . I ordered the white , it does have a foam grip . Took 5 minutes to install , removed the old ( 4 screws ) and install the new .
5 #### Having read reviews where people got caases too small for a 12 - string , this one fits just fine . Seems to be good quality , though it 's never been thru any kind of usage test .
5 #### I got the medium , too small . My fault but this is a quality product .
4 #### Great as a backup to carry around . I think it would be better if it was flatter / thinner . LED light may or may not be useful but why not . New Trent offers great deals if you purchase more than one of their products on amazon .
5 #### Not gon na lie , I do n't like the 9 gauge strings as much as the 10 gauge strings , but as far as quality goes , I would n't trust anybody other than D'Addario for my electric guitar string needs . SUCH good strings . I love them .
5 #### Have a Scion Tc ... and installed new speakers all around made the speakers secure and stable with no RATTLING ! the BASS rattling on the plastic trim was driving my mad ! so now I 'm buying a BULK PACK of this wonderful stuff and laying it down for the ROAD Noise . THHHHHHHanks !
5 #### I used one of these for the last 5 years and is the best I 've used to dry my cars . really is outstanding and the best for this task .
5 #### What more can I say , it 's a usb cable that works like it 's supposed to .
5 #### This product is a life saver . For those times when the smartphone just will not last an entire day , this product helps me out . I like how the cable that chargers your phone also serves as the cable that chargers this spare battery . That is a nice touch that keeps me from having to carry too many cords . This device is about the same size as a smartphone but has the thickness of a deck of cards . I find though that I can easily put this battery and my smartphone easily into my coat or suit jacket pocket without issue to allow the phone to charge . The indicator lights on the battery seem accurate , both to display the charging status of the spare batter itself and the discharge rate when it is charging my phone . My only wish for this product is that it would supply 1A instead of 600mA , in order to charge the smartphone faster . Overall , this is a great product .
5 #### Lens works very well for how cheap it is ! Impressed with the video I shot with it ! !
5 #### I remember when these were $ 20 , not $ 200 . Aside from when dust and crap gets caught in the ball holder , it 's very comfortable and easy to use , allowing precise - enough control to play FPSs and RTSs and literally anything . Unfortunately , they 're no longer manufactured and they 're way too expensive . If I did n't already have one from years ago , I 'd consider buying the cheapest used one I could get . It has to be cleaned at least once a week , but by that I just mean picking dust bunnies out with my fingernails . I have a second one of these , but it 's broken . Now I 'm pretty sad that it 's broken , 'cause I 'd be sitting on an easy $ 100 if it was n't ! The only existing alternative I have seen that is still manufactured , and thus not an insanely high price , is the blue wireless Logitech trackball .
5 #### buenos das gracias por el producto estoy muy satisfecho , la entrega fue rapida como estaba indicada en la compra bay hasta luego
5 #### my favorite pick . take it from a pro , this gives you the best compromise puck out there
5 #### I had one of those capos with the handles on the bottom because they were the " new " thing . They hit my knuckles when playing certain open chords . Changed back to this style . You just ca n't go wrong with a Kyser . And ... love the color .
1 #### I purchased this router to replace an SMC Barricade NAT Router I have behind a Linksys wireless router for security . The wireless Linksys works very well . My connection drops now and then and I thought it might be the SMC because it 's several years old and the BEFSR41 might be more compatible . The problem I had was that I could n't get the password to reset no matter what I did . I followed the directions that came with the router and went on the web site to be sure I was doing it properly . Could n't reset it to the factory settings and could n't get access with the easy password I used to set it up . I think this one was just defective . My Linksys wireless works great all the time .
5 #### This was the first stop leak I tried . I do wonder what would happen if I needed to apply a strong vacuum in the future . I might need another dose .
4 #### While the controls are not the easiest to work , the sound quality of stereo music from my Treo 800w cellphone 's MP3 player is very good . I wish , however , that I could get the plugs into my ears a little better . If I push them closer , the sound really improves even though it was pretty good from the start . I normally used a Jawbone II for talking on my cellphone so people are surprised when they can hear everything within a quarter mile of me with this headset . However , they say that the quality of my voice is better with this than the Jawbone . If I had to buy someone a Bluetooth stereo headset , I would most likely buy one of these . Oh , make sure you get the newer " HD " model .
5 #### Used this headset until I broke the earphone piece . That was 3.5 years . Ca n't ask for better quality than that .
5 #### Excellent-- Works Exactly as Described . I paired it with the 18 - 2442 Antennae for Out & About Use . Also the NOAA reports come in Loud & Clear with the Rubber Antenna .
2 #### This navigation come with a very old map it does not have up to date location and roads if you want that you must update it on the garmin website but it is not free it will cost you 50 dollar or more just for a update of the map . But with that you could just buy a newer model it would be alot cheaper that way . This navigation does come with very responsive touchscreen though .
5 #### When my uncle said he needed fixing , interior was first on the list was happy to get his stereo in
5 #### Quality product as always from 3 M , spray is strong and recommend guarding your eyes from splash effect .
4 #### I 'd be really , really surprised if anyone looking to buy this has never used it before . Every high school band room has a couple of these . Every folk band , every church band , every world music band I 've ever seen or played with has had this exact shaker . It does exactly what you expect and has a decent tone that 's not tinny like an egg shaker . It 's not a One Shot , so do n't buy it if that 's what you 're looking for .
5 #### this test lead set is great.high quality construction.was really impressed with the large alligator clips.the backprobes are also very well designed and built.the pierceing probes are possibly the best ever designed .
4 #### I had a stereo shop install some amps in the rear of the cab in my Chevy truck . They screwed screws THROUGH the cab , sticking out toward the bed ! I was in panic mode until I found this product . It 's almost like pre - mixed JB Weld . Squirt some over the small holes , let it dry 24 hours , and bingo . It dries hard just like metal . It 's a little hard to ' form ' - it has a high surface tension , so smoothing or working it a certain way is n't too simple . I just squirted it where I needed it and let it try since I 'm covering the area with carpet anyway . Good stuff !
3 #### Reception is fine ; it has no clock , and the arm band slips a bit so that when you remove it you have to be careful that the radio does n't fall and crack on the ground . But it 's worth the price , a far better deal than the 60 - dollar Sony product . The ear - bud speakers get tangled easily and I 've replaced them with my old ten - dollar headphones . In the end , I 'm satisfied with my purchase .
5 #### I bought this to see if there is a leak since it 's red . I do n't know if it had any cooling effect over the regular stuff . I am glad i have not found any leaks ... and i would buy this again .
5 #### Just had it installed and awesome sound for my Nissan Frontier .
5 #### My Dell Windows 8 tablet took it and uses it for additional storage , saving HD space .
5 #### Great pair of sticks for my playing and hand size . They are strong yet do n't feel like they weigh a ton . Highly recommend these for any 2B player .
5 #### I 've been using these for 47 years . You can pick quicker with these than any other kind . Some call them " jazz picks . " Not sure why . We always called them " speed picks " ( as oppose to " hootenanny picks " ) . Very comforting to know they are still available by the several dozen .
5 #### i need clarinet reed to perform and i was thinking to use this reed and every one Loved the sound Thanks Seller i Will purchase again after when i finish using
5 #### I really love this product . It works right out of the box . I charged it using the car charger that came with it . Nothing else to buy everything you need is included in the box . This device paired without any effort to my Blackberry Curve . The sound quality is excellent ! ! People do n't even realize I am on a headset . It is amazing something so small can recognize voice commands . I highly recommend this product . I purchased this after using a Jabra BT250V. The range on the Jabra was n't very good with my Curve , but the V1 is excellent . Very comfortable on my ear , a very close race between this and Jabra in terms of comfort . Everything else the V1 is far superior . Great buy for the money !
5 #### My very 1st Studio Monitor Headphones & I love it ! After reading many reviews for 4weeks I finally decided to buy this Sony MDRV6 & no regrets on my part . Great headphones , great sound for the price , been using it for 2months now & everything sounds so much better than my old Panasonic RP - HTX7 - P1 .
5 #### I have been using Dunlop 's Dual Design Strap locks for years . I have tried a few other brands , but always end up coming back to Dunlop . Very easy to install , and I have not ever had one fail . Well made , and will not change the look of your instrument at all . Includes a longer set screw , which gives it even more stability .
5 #### My parents ( ages 79 and 80 ) have a very basic LG phone . They know how it works and how to use it so when the battery was no longer holding a charge , we discussed the unfortunate possibility of replacing the phone . I had no problems finding a replacement battery for it so decided to buy 2 . The price was excellent , the delivery was very quick and these replacements are not aftermarket copies ! They are the real deal and they are both holding charges as brand new batteries should ! Thank you for saving my parents the frustration of having to learn a new phone again !
5 #### The bluetooth BlueAnt V1 is an amazing headset with the voice control it makes accessing the phone . Dialling # s is much easier with the voice caller ID . Very easy to program and access and I give it 5 of 5 stars , oh and the price at Amazon compared to other company
3 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . Just looks pretty delicate and sort of cheap . I guess it 's worth about what I paid for it .
5 #### I did a test and compared it to the Shure SM58 . This mic is more sensitive and the sound is crisper . But not necessarily better . They are both great mics .
5 #### Pricey , but fixed my leaky steering system . Took about an hour to install and re - bleed the system .
5 #### Amazing ! I had a horrible shudder right at when overdrive would engage ... between 4th and overdrive shift in my 2004 F-150 Automatic Transmission 4X4 . I even took it to the Ford dealership and they did a trans service ... I asked them to install the friction modifiers needed for the shudder .... they charged me $ 195 and it did nothing for the shudder . Then I happened on this product and it arrived two days after I ordered it , on a Sunday ! I put it in the trans dip stick tube , and drove it immediately hoping against hope that the shudder would at least not be so severe . Well much to my surprise , it shifts so much smother , it does n't shudder AT ALL anymore , and I mean it happened the minute I put it in the transmission . I thought I needed a torque converter and maybe a trans rebuild , but I don't .... all I needed was Dr. Tranny Shudder Fix ..... the damn thing works ! Yee Haw ! It saved me a fortune . Thanks Lubegard ! Gene
5 #### It seem every device that uses button batteries use a different size . Since I have several watches and other devices that use these batteries it is convenient and inexpensive to order on line .
5 #### A great way to play and keep to a softer volume in a smaller venue .
5 #### This is the third battery in my UPS . It works as expected . APC has a recycle program that you print the shipping label and the old battery is returned with the postage paid by APC . That works great also .
5 #### These are probably the best nickle strings I have tried . The burnished means less string noise so if you want to do a lot of pick scrapes probably not for you but if you want it a bit quieter when changing positions . tone on these is excellent great presence .
5 #### Always a good buy , especially for a new car . I hit a deer so I needed a new one . I only use AVS brand ... the package was missing the sticky things that protect the paint more , but they mailed me out a set right away .
5 #### I got this bag to carry around my 7D & glass . The only thing is that I do n't know how they fit 2 DSLR camera bodies & how ever many lenses they claimed to be able to fit in there . But I am only able to fit my 7D camera body with Battery grip , the 24 - 105 mm f4 , 70 - 200 mm f2.8 USM II , the 100 - 300 mm f3.5 - 5.6 , the 100 mm f2.8 Macro , The 580 EX flash , Duster brush , Canon Battery charger , USB cable , rechargeable battery charger , 24 rechargeable batteries , 2 microfiber cloths and a little room for my phone . If anybody else has been able to fit more cameras or lenses in their 1EG bag please reply to my post . So I am not complaining but I just ca n't figure out where they put all the stuff they said they got in their bad :)
2 #### The quality is wonderful , however .... the holder is so narrow that you can not put a pair of glasses in them . My husband squeezed the width of the holder to make it expand . He was able to accomplish the task enough so that our 7 year old granddaughters glasses were able to go in . I must say that it is still a tight fit .
5 #### What can you say about a muffler . If this one fits your needs order it . Quality made just what I needed .
5 #### Daddario is a great brand for strings . I have had these for some time and they still have yet to pop . Got my value out of them
1 #### The adjustment screw wore out after just a few weeks . Spend a little more and buy a better quality product
5 #### Need to be able to recharge the phone ... what can I say .
5 #### This is a nice cable . Made from good materials and is attractive . I needed a 10 foot cable and I m glad I did n't buy one from the store .
5 #### Ethanol sucks , but you 're stuck with it in your gas . This stuff helps keep your carb and fuel systems clean . if you 've got start problems or rough run problems , dump last years ' gas and put a bit of this in the tank straight and pull until you flush it through the fuel lines and carbs to break down the varnish . treats gas to keep it fresh before you put something up for winter . This stuff has saved me from making several trips to the shop .
4 #### * * IMPORTANT NOTE : This product also fits the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Brother - PT-65 - Labeler / dp / B00004VVIX / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Brother PT-65 Labeler</a > ! ! ! ( The description only lists the newer model label - makers . ) I love my label - maker and ca n't imagine life without it . I label Rubbermaid totes , charging cables , A / V equipment , boxes , leftovers for the freezer , etc ... and it always sticks to everything ... and actually comes off cleanly as well . Just make sure whatever you 're labeling is dust / dirt free and you 'll be good to go .
5 #### Love them . Polyweb is where it 's at , better than the nanowebs . That extra coating makes it easier to play and more durable . They sound fantastic .
5 #### I enjoy the metal belt clip on this pouch . It allows transferring my radio from my chest rig to duty belt when needed , all without having to rely on the flimsy belt clip that is common on smaller UHF / VHF radios . The elastic sides allows for a tight fit if I am trying to include an ear piece , but once in the pouch , the elastic acts as another layer of security to ensure my connection will never be lose . I 'll say that after using this for awhile now , it 's not perfect if you 're using the ear piece plugged - in . It is too tight and will cause unwanted transmissions depending on your movement .
2 #### Well it does lower the sound level a bit . Not very efficient . Better to use the volume control on the noise maker itself .
3 #### My old standby ..... was able toget 3 good ones out of the box ...... about average for a box of ten .
2 #### did n't fit the steering wheel of my john deere riding mower , had to return
3 #### This item reduced the up & down motion in my cargo carrier to some degree , but not as much as I had hoped . I have also had to tighten it twice in the 2 months that I have had it . It okay , but definitely not a cure - all .
4 #### Bought these for everything they were , a pair of cheap throw away head phones . They have outperformed several throwaways I 've owned ( except for a pair I once collected from a flight ) . I carry these around in a cramped back pack daily and they have not failed me . Excellent quality for the price also . pros + good sound + inexpensive + durable + look good cons can you really complain about a $ 6 pair of headphones ?
3 #### good started guitar . would recommend buying new stings with it made it sound so much better .
5 #### great material , nice cover ! although a little - bit smaller for my 05 Jaguar S - type , still did the job . thank you !
5 #### I used to use the D'Addario EXL116 ( 11 - 52 ) on all of my Eb Strats . For me the wound strings , especially the low E , were too chunky and overbearing , both in feel and sound . I went to these ( 11 - 49 ) and could n't be happier ! Love the tone , love the feel ! I float the trem on my Strats and the tuning stability is spot on . I had a similar experience with the Ernie Ball equivalent , but I 've been using D'Addarios for years and with the " Subscribe and Save " program , you just ca n't beat it ! BTW , I still use D'Addario EXL110 ( 10 - 46 ) on my standard - tuned Strats because , well , D'Addario Rocks ! .
5 #### bought this as an impulse item , an add on to avoid shipping charges on another order . I am very glad I chose it- good heavy quality and bright contrasting color makes it a great addition to my Gibson Songwriter
5 #### I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for wire brushes for the drums . It is nice that they retract . Easy to use .
5 #### In my opinion , these are the absolute best thing you can buy to dry things . I use them to dry vehicles after washing them . Never disappointing !
5 #### I purchased these stick about two years ago and loved them very much , I purchase them at the local Music Store here in Kingston , Jamaica . When I went back to buy some more they where all gone :( When I saw these on Amazon I decided to stock up on as many as I could get . I bought about 10 pairs , too bad that 's all they had available at the time . Anyway , If you are serious about drumming and practice and perform a lot these are the stick for you .
3 #### It 's just okay . To little for my large size hands .... I had a hard time using it due to its size . Bought 2 , gave them both away .
5 #### Their is n't much you can say about a cord , but this one is well made , and it does what it is supposed to do . I have a keyboard , a Yamaha MM6 that I wanted to attach to my computer , so I can record through Cubase LE . I started tripping over the standard size cord , so I added this Belkin extension , and now it is safely tucked away . Sure beats having to replace the USB port in the computer from abuse . Belkin makes nice stuff , and this is one of those things that they make well . Highly recommended .
5 #### I 've owned multiple of these . Never let me down . Great product look nice . Definitely worth the price . Great warranty and easy to work with customer service . Ordered a set for my friend and a year later they were n't working right . Kc paid shipping fixed and sent back and worked ever since . Best part is they let us send in the relay and lights so we did n't have to unwire and rewire which was nice because the writing was n't the issue . I 'd buy them a million times over .
3 #### Bought the headphones based solely on the comfort rating , but was solely disappointed . The band is pretty tight and the foam pads are flat and very thin . I have n't even tested the audio performance , but I imagine at this price range it would be surprising to get anything decent . I was hoping for something like the Jetblue headphones that I got many years ago while taking a flight with them . Even those headphones given away for free are much more comfortable and have thick pads . Unfortunately my JetBlue headphones broke down and I 'm still in the search .
1 #### I thought this was a top of the line grease gun . I was wrong it wo n't prime correctly . It takes more effort to get grease flowing than actually getting the job done .
5 #### I used this on the stock resonant head on my Gretsch drums . It worked great , was easy to use , and install time , including the hole cutting , took about 5 minutes . Buy one of these if you just need a hole in your head , and you don;t want to spend the money on a new one .
4 #### JUST WHAT I NEEDE FOR MY APPLICATION . THE USE OF DOUBLE SIDED TAPE HELPS KEEP THE LIP AGAINST THE FENDERS .
5 #### I have a belt case for my workdays , but when I 'm not at work this is a great way to protect your expensive toy . The phone fits perfectly , and is easy to slide in and out . Plus , the indicator light is just visible so you can see it when the phone is in the pouch . I prefer to use my phone naked ( with a screen protector ) , and this pouch is the perfect solution to keep it safe when not in use .
1 #### I was very happy with the quick delivery and the product . However ; approximately 1.5 weeks later the phone was defective and not working . This is the reason why I gave the product a low rating .
5 #### Fits like a glove . Keeps the heat & sun out of the truck and helps keep the RV from getting too hot . It also keeps our nosy dogs from looking out the truck windows , barking & annoying other campers . We had to adjust the Velcro straps around the mirrors and it 's a perfect fit . Great buy !
5 #### As with all hdmi cable as long as you do n't get snow in your signal it will work . Just make sure you are n't constantly replugging it into ports and you do n't get snow it should be fine .
4 #### Good , Quality , very extreme white compare the sylvania silverstar , very clear light , and very white compare with the standard light , but the silverstar has more power or distance to cover and illuminate . If someone wants very white ( PIAA ) but someone wants distance to cover ( silverstar ) .
5 #### I needed a 7 - pin blade receptacle for my toad ( RV towable auto)to allow its use for transporting waste water - I have a carrier and haul up to 60 gals on a carrier to dump the sewer from the RV using a macerator pump . Works like a champ . I pump from the RV into the tank then haul to the dump station to pump it out . I can also hook to a trailer with or without brakes using the same connector .
4 #### while it works , it is about as twice as thick as a solid case . But I guess it needs that to be lighter . I am not sure I would buy another one of these when compared to the price of a hard shell .
5 #### Gator Cases Never Failed Me yet ! Perfect fit for Yamaha DGX series
3 #### So far so good . Just used it this weekend and seems to work with my iPhone . Liking it so far , we will see how long it lasts . I do n't have the best of luck with these .
3 #### These are a bit too stiff and too thick for me for general purpose use . Picks are a matter of personal preference . If you need a more percussive attack with your instrument and you do n't mind the extra thickness , they might be perfect for your application . I use an assortment of picks and what I use depends on the instrument and the tone I 'm after . The pick I prefer most often is the Dunlop Herco Reissue in Gray . Also , keep in mind that if you order these because they are " jazz " picks and you want something like the small red nylon Dunlops like Eric Johnson and others use , do n't let the " jazz " reference influence you to buy these as these are not like the small red nylon picks in size and feel . The reds are much smaller and will produce a much different tone .
4 #### This is a great cable if you have a guitar or any other instrument that has a front facing input jack . The only issue I 've had so far is some cutting of the signal through it one time . It has n't occurred since , but I 'm still skeptical and leery while I 'm using it .
4 #### wish they were a little shorter ca nt even raise them up to the first notch with the ramps I currently have but they work really well
4 #### i needed one longer and they had it and i m happy to have gotten it already every thing was good ty .
5 #### Nice case with a nice design . I like how it wraps around the front of the phone . Seems to protect it more .
3 #### A little to stiff and not stretchy enough to be truly comfortable . I have another neoprene strap that is far more comfortable .. I just have to figure ut wh made it so I can buy another one . Unfortanetly this one was n't the same .
4 #### I like a lighter gauge string for bending , but the E and A on the strings I was using were too thin sounding . These fix that perfectly . My new favorite strings .
4 #### Bought this for use with my laptop and find it a little irritating because of the design for much smaller MP3 players , etc . , but it is a great performing headset . the tabs that hold it together when you fold it up are prone to irritate my ears because they protrude and I 'm sensitive , and using the expanding / sliding , very thin metal head bands is irritating to me , but for a runner , or someone wanting extreme , folding portability with greats performance , they are top notch . They are quiet to bystanders , but deliver awesome sound to your ears ... no complaints about that .
5 #### If you play bluegrass or anything related to it , and you 're not running EXP74 , chances are you are using J74 sets ! Most pickers ( of bluegrass and/or its derivatives ) prefer playing these over the rest . I 've gone back and forth over the years , trying other string sets - even those of ( shock , horror ) other manufacturers . FYI : Chris Thile endorses the EXP75 set , and says they last him three times as long as the ( uncoated ) J75 , affording him to play three gigs instead of just the one on J75 strings .
5 #### Works perfectly , makes tuning your drums the same way each time much easier . Terrific purchase and i would buy it again .
5 #### Great fit with lots of useful pockets . I work on the water and this is a necessity for safety .
5 #### best steering wheel cover money can buy . You have to let it stretch about 3 times before its actually tight but after that you get a very very nice cover . So do n't be turned off when it gets loose after the first itme you put it on . That s gunna happen , Just retighten it and let it stretch a bit .
5 #### Came as described . Use your own hardware ... they work well though .
2 #### Purchased 4 of these units because of the reviews and high ratings here and by CNet . Recently my one of my headsets stopped working . When plugged it in to recharge it , a red light would light up and stay lit for 5 minutes and then go away . However , the unit would not turn on at all . I called customer support and they said it is due to a defective battery and that the battery should last 3 - 5 yrs . Mine lasted for 9 months under occasional use . They agreed to send a new unit out to me , but the replacement may or may not be refurbished vs new and I would have to pay for shipping back of defective item . For such an expensive headset this is very poor customer service . My business will go to Jawbone next time around . Btw , when the products works , it works quite well . Hearing the caller is not so great in sound quality but supposedly they can hear you very well .
5 #### A great feel , and not a bad lead pick , though a stiffer pick does increase your speed , though slows you down on chords . This pick is a great compromise .
3 #### They work for my needs , but the rubber insulators around the clamps are a little too slippery , so it 's hard to get the clamps to open without turning around inside the insulator . They 're not easy to pull back to allow operating the clamps directly either . Also , the wires are pretty stiff and never seem to give up the shape you see in the product photo . That can be a problem when working with relatively small clamps that can slip off when you move things around a bit .
5 #### Love these strings . I did n't like the way the first string sounded when I played bar chords with the other strings . These strings make my acoustic guitar a dream to play . Going to put these on my other acoustic guitars .
5 #### I have a Fender DG-8s ( acoustic ) . It 's just a $ 200 guitar ( at most ) . It 's not great , but then , neither am I. But I have been watching lots of youtube videos and playing about 10 hours / week . I can play all of the normal bar chords and open chords and plink around a bit at lead guitar . I really did not expect these strings to sound good on this guitar , but I really like the sound . If you like that kind of dreamy fleetwood mac sound , you 'll like these strings on an acoustic . Thicker strings tear my fingers up ... even after 10 hours / week . These have a nice sound and are easy to play . I 'm not a heavy strummer so no problem with these strings . I do n't perform in public , so I have no feedback to back up my claim of a nice sound . I tried bronze ( Elixer polyweb ) , thicker strings but they sounded flat ( deader ... not as rich ) to me ... I think they 're made for heavier strumming . In the winter time ( in Virginia ) the neck of this guitar warps enough that the 12th fret ( and 2 more after ) on the high E string just buzzes ... no sound ... just buzz . I 'm not sure if that 's because of these thin strings not pulling enough on the neck , or just because I do n't control humidity in the house .
5 #### Installed in my IS 350 . Could have used another few square feet , but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet , spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation . Do n't forget the license plate and fuel door .
5 #### Wonderful product , exactly as described ... very durable and solid color and not cheap looking at all or transparent . Shipping was accurate and timely . Overall absolutely great buy and experience ! :)
1 #### n my honest opinion nook is unfinished product . none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle - size font . i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable . formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable . i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine - tuning the text rendering on ebook reader . other issue is font randomly changing from small to medium in pdf format .
5 #### Awesome ! ! First repair saved me big bucks and lot of guess work ..... Money well spent ! !
5 #### I bought these based on one thing - the clip . In addition to the spring steel clip you may ( as I do ) opt for the belt loop on this which is behind the spring clip . Have lost or damaged a few when the spring clip slips off the belt so I thought this was an excellent feature .
5 #### I have tried way too many bluetooth headsets ( Motorola , Plantronics , IO Gear , Logitech , Jabra ) and found most to be disappointing . IMHO , the Scala 700 right now is the best bang for the buck . This is my second product from Cardo Scala - the first being the 500 , which was also a great headset . The 500 had great sound on both ends and was more than loud enough . Most other headsets suffer from earpiece volume that is just not loud enough . Also the lack of noise cancellation and wind noise reduction on the other headsets made them only useful in the office or a quiet car . The Scala 700 windguard technology is not perfect - but performs much better than anything else I have tried . The 700 is about 1/3 smaller than the 500 and performs just as well in every aspect . The buttons and controls are easy to use and intuitive . It takes a little tweaking to adjust the headset for a comfortable fit , but after some bending and shaping of the earpiece , the headset was very stable and comfortable . For the price , this is a very good option .
5 #### Put on golf cart to charge my phone . It works perfictly .
5 #### The metal connectors have a quality look . They are also pretty flexible . Now that I see how nice these are I wo n't bother with anything cheaper . Get them , you 'll be happy .
3 #### I was very disapointedwith this i thought the cooler came with the rack WRONG . YOU get the rack it'e a little weak .
5 #### Much better design than most funnels , works great for tough angles
5 #### It was delivered on time , even faster than expected . The quality of the headset is excellent thank you .
4 #### Seems to work well so far heats up fairly quick
3 #### Difficult to splice cleanly . They work but I found something I like better
5 #### There 's not much to say about it , except that it works for my 99 silverado . However I did not care for the printed instructions that came with it . If I had not already watched a video on youtube about it I would not have gotten the part about bending the metal tabs back on the bracket that came with the stereo ( maybe a duh moment , but hey , I had never done this before ! ) . In any case it fit , it works , it covers up the hole and it looks pretty good for what I paid for it . I recommend going to Crutchfield or somewhere like that and looking up the part numbers for whatever adapter is needed for your vehicle , then come back here and purchase it because it 's cheaper that way .
2 #### EDIT : 3/14/2013 All good things must come to an end . Kyser no longer donates money to the Komen foundation , the lifetime warranty has been shortened to a 1 year warranty , Kyser 's latest products do not say , " Made in USA " on them , and all that good mojo has pretty much been sold up the river trying to squeeze a couple more pennies out of their customers ... For about eleven dollars LESS , you can buy a high quality Kyser knock - off , right here on Amazon , and put the extra money into your own pocket instead of into the hands of some greedy MBA types who ruined what used to be a great American product . ORIGINAL REVIEW : For every pink capo sold , Kyser donates a dollar to the Susan G. Komen foundation . Also , Kyser capos are made in the USA by Americans . A good product , a good cause , a good company , and good mojo ... And what better way to impress the ladies ! ? ;-) Charity starts at HOME !
4 #### The battery lasts longer than the standard one . It works just fine , and having an extra battery around at all times is a necessity if you use any of the media applications on the Droid .
1 #### This product is light , flimsy , and the top will not stay on . I do NOT recommend it . Check out : Aqua Blue / Black / Red Capacitive Stylus / styli Touch Screen Cellphone Tablet Pen for iPhone 4 4s 3 3Gs iPod Touch iPad 2 Motorola Xoom , Samsung Galaxy , BlackBerry Playbook AMM0101US , Barnes and Noble Nook Color , Droid Bionic .
5 #### bought this for a birthday gift . i was soooo pleased with its sturdiness and looks . she was wowed . lovely to look at
2 #### Sound is great , design is poor . Do n't expect to use these for more than a few months . When the pleather deteriorates the low - end frequency response goes out the window with it 's noise - cancelling ability . Product shipped looks different than the product shown . It appears this model was redesigned and the image has not been updated .
5 #### It 's actually sleek looking and although I did n't have the nerve to actually stick this to my guitar , it 's a lot easier to find this in my guitar bag or even in my room than a few stray picks here and there . It holds about 8 medium size picks for me and I 'm sure I 'll lose a lot less picks because of it ! It 's almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing .. is that weird to say ? Just buy it already !
5 #### good for used .I already have one and had to get another one for a different
5 #### This is a excellent product that worked exactly a I needed it to . It 's excellent for a small home recording studio . Easy to use , good sound quality . And it arrived quickly .
5 #### I love the clarity and punch I get with these . They 're great with a variety of pickups . Highly recommended !
5 #### I 've been using this for almost a year now . I love that it protects my phone and I do n't have to continually remove my regular phone case for a special gym case . They are 1 and the same ! Extremely convenient !
5 #### Works great in old commemorative pocket watch I had put away years ago . Batteries came packaged well , on time , and at a great price .
4 #### This gives me about one and half charges . I like the small size , but prefer more power and two USB outputs .
5 #### Ventshades are the best they help with keeping the sun off of my face . It also help your vehicle stay cooler in the summer , long lasting product .
5 #### I have used PlastX on my cars and my friends ' cars as well . This is the easiest way to polish our headlights to make them look great again . I have a 5 year old Toyota Sienna and I park it outside so the LA sun is just punishing the plastic headlight and tailight cover . Once a month , I apply a little PlastX to my headlights and it keeps it looking new . I just apply a little on a rag and I spread it on the headlight . I then proceed to buff it with another rag . I do not use force , just like buffing the wax on my car . And then I remove any excess . Very simple , and it really works . My car looks better than when it drove it out of the dealer 's lot . I use Mequiar 's other products to keep my car looking new . No need to buy a new car because my car looks really good .
5 #### OK , silly to write a review on batteries ... they either work or they do n't . These are fresh batteries that do what they are supposed to do .
5 #### This protector was a great buy . I received it in an envelope about four days after ordering it . It was very easy to install . Make sure that the surface it clean and free of any dust of fingerprints . I suggest applying it from the bottom edge up to prevent any bubbles from appearing . After the simple install , the protector is not noticeable at all . Great product , I am very happy with it .
1 #### Read the fine print . Even though a fuse is shown in the photo , it is not included . The wire ends also do n't come finished . Somehow I had to pay return shipping . Complete deception . Piece of garbage .
3 #### Like the title says I had a bit of a problem when this came to me in the mail . The picks were spread across the box because they fell out of their package and I do n't believe I actually got 12 I think it was 10 . The location of the star is too high ! If you can actually put your fingers on it then you without a doubt need to inch up closer to the tip of the pick or continue to lose control . The material of the pick , visual , and actual tip of the pick is fine with me , but the reason you 'd buy these is obviously for the grip which I do n't feel it has perfect .
4 #### I have used a smaller version of this product for many years now . It really does do a nice job drying , and holding the water . You might think it will leave streaks at first , but they dry and it leaves a very nice finish . Go ahead and get one , you should like it .
3 #### Item does work well as far as sound quality and setup ease . However ear loop is basically not adjustable at all , consequently making the ear piece itself to constantly work its way out of my ear and feel as if it were just hanging there ... After days of pushing ear piece back into my ear canal and hoping the loop would give a bit . i returned it for exactly those reasons ... Great sound quality and no one i spoke to claimed to hear any distortion . just did n't fit well with no possible adjusting available ...
4 #### I am a beginner guitarist , I am happy with this capo . It works good and that is all I need . The fit and finish seems like quality also .
3 #### I use this for heavy 30 lb + lighting fixtures and the crossbar dented in very easily . I had to go to home depot and purchase some steel piping and rubber fitting to get this lighting tree to accommodate heavier fixtures . I own 2 and they are still being used . I have to weigh it down with sand bags , but no big deal .
1 #### Ca nt handle 24v , fried my camera and a laptop , ended up putting step downs on them as our boat is wired for 24v , they now work fine .
5 #### Great quality housings , significantly better than the plastic ones sold on eBay . I paired these housings with SYLVANIA 9003 ( H4 ) bulbs .
3 #### Okay . As advertised and the reviews are fairly accurate . They sound good , somewhat noise suppressing due to the compress / expansion nature of the earbuds . The " highs " are n't crisp , but the bass tones are good .
5 #### I 'm a fairly new player , on an Epi Les Paul . I know it 's not a Gibson , but when I first got the guitar I quickly found that something sounded awful , and I tracked it down to the G string . A little research revealed the issue and led me to try this set with a wound G. It was a great improvement , for my ears anyway . Last time I changed strings , I found that I still had a set with a non - wound G so I put those on . Ow , my ears ! The G always sounds to me like a plane flying over . ( I 've checked and adjusted the intonation and it 's good . ) I ca n't wait to get the 110W back on . My strings might not be the weakest link in my playing , but at least on this guitar these are the only way to go .
5 #### Been using it for 12 years on my 02 Mercury navy blue cloth top and it really looks as good as new . I asked at the detailer if they would be able to clean the green ? on my cloth top and they said " no guarantee " So I went on line to Auto Geek and found it .
3 #### got this so long ago , I 'm not even sure I was the one who go it ! !
5 #### I really like these screen protectors . The best I have used so far . They last forever too . I am about ready to order more before too long . Thank you .
5 #### Great mount sticks to my windshield and hold my iPhone 6 perfectly . Great price highly recommend .
4 #### It prevented oil spill somewhat . I had to hold a 5 quart in one hand and this one the other . However , it slowing rate is too slow causing to change the oil bottle angle multiple times which as result , leaking some oil through the bottle opening .
5 #### I had an exact same one for years . It came with the COSTCO bundle , and I had no problem with it for a few years . Not bad .
4 #### Works great ! Just what I was looking for in an inexpensive compact binocular ...
4 #### Solid box with good protection . I have had it fall out a couple of times when I do n't get it attached just right when I am carrying it horizontally . You have to make sure it is really snugly in just right . The vibrate / sound off button is hard to access due to the thickness of the case . Small fingers or a findernail may not have this problem .
4 #### Simple , does it 's job , and appears to be well manufactured .
2 #### Customer liked this case ... it is pretty however , again the case does not fit the phone .... it is too short and does not get around the phone .... the phone does not fit down in the cover .... very disappointing .
3 #### Three feet is not quite long enough for normal use . Six feet should be standard . I knew what I ordered though .
5 #### Fits perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active . No installation or recognition issues . The phone nicely takes over as a portable media device on long flights . This card presently contains several movies and a huge amount of music across many genres . The phone mates perfectly with powered headphones , making the phone + card combo a powerhouse . Room for plenty of apps , too . So far , it contains over 20 GB of entertainment alone - more than enough to keep me busy for a few minutes ... ;- ) There 's plenty of room left for photos and phone movies . Could n't be more pleased .
5 #### Yes i have ancient tech . I have 2 dvd - vhs players ( stop laughing ) . they no longer make VHS tapes i believe . So get these while they last . they work well and are easy to use .
4 #### This has great reach and a heavy duty handle . The ' strings ' are flimsy and shedding a bit right now . It looks like that will stop at some point though . It does do a good job . I like that it helps me reach the middle of my car since I am so short !
5 #### Works very well on my Nissan Quest 2012 . Very useful for reversing , parking and lane changing . It totally eliminates blind spots which is very useful for me , because I ca n't turn my neck after a surgery I had . It 's quite big , which suits my minivan , but it will be a bit too big for smaller wing mirrors . Took some time to get used to it , since it 's view is very different from the mirror it will be stuck on - but that 's true for all stick - on mirrors .
3 #### These strings are durable but do not have a great tone .
5 #### My wife needs these so I bought them for her . No complaints
3 #### Kind of cheap , ended up returning it . It did n't fit well with my mic and did n't seem to get the job done .
5 #### These originals play great on my old Strat . Slot em in , Tune em up , let her rip ! The Not Even Slinky set is the best you can buy for affordable downtuning . They have a nice thick sound and they do n't wobble all over the joint .
5 #### Arrived on time , it was very easy to install and with the low profile , you will barely know it 's there .
4 #### Good value for the money , I have only . Use one of them , but do n't use it very often to be honest .
5 #### Install was a snap . Great product . I replaced the auto lockers with these on my 93 Bronco and it helped clear up some axle issues I was having , as well . Warn makes a tough product .
5 #### Got this spare tire cover for my Starcraft pop - up camper . Fits great !
5 #### Worked great with my old floor jack and sealed up the minor leak .
4 #### These fit the iPhone 4 and my Droid Pro . Snug fit , great colors , and were a bargain as we had not decided on permanent iPhone & Droid protective hard shells . Makes great stocking stuffers , too .
5 #### Was really pleased with the sound on this headset . My old ones crackled and cut out . The sound on these are awesome . Ca n't go wrong for the price !
5 #### Works much better than the Cobra look alike . Lets me adjust the squelch and communicate with other drivers .
5 #### If you have lots of small engines and service yourself . This is what the Doctor ordered . Save time and money .
3 #### It was stated that this worked with the s5 Active . While , yes , the battery itself does swap between the two , the necessary casing does not . I had to use a dremel to cut out a space for the battery on the original back of my phone , and the rubber case had to be altered as well . Please , make a note that the casing will not fit the s5 active , or make an option for cases that will fit it . I needed this battery before the weekend ( it is now Wednesday ) , so I ca n't return it and expect to get a different one in time , so this will have to work
5 #### Basic wire . Works . Too pricy for a basic part made up of wiring and plastic . Not much more to say .
5 #### I was not sure to buy it due to some of the reviewers who said that it can break easily , especially the upper part but it is not true ... well , the case IS NOT INDESTRUCTIBLE ... of course not , you are not paying for THE indestructible case but for protection . The case is great , fits perfectly my Milestone and it feels really great on hand . Overall the case is just what I was expecting and if it breaks for any reason , exactly that is the idea , it to broke and not my phone :) And of course , Amazon service really great as always !
1 #### broke in the center after an hour of normal use on an electronic kit . Super lame . I also got a terrible blister because of the rubber , I am a seasoned drummer and my hands are strong but the rubber just rubs me the wrong way ..........
5 #### I recently replaced a bunch of aging sennheiser mics with a mix of these Sure beta mics . Wow , what a difference in sound ! I manage a classic rock band . I recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear . Cables , mics , stands , snakes , etc . We have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff . It is all good quality and working fine . Does exactly what I expected it to do . No surprises . In the interest of time I am applying this exact same review to all of the items I bought for this purpose and am happy with . FWIW , I am also taking the time to be critical of the items I am not completely happy with .
4 #### Works . Keeps a call miles beyond where I usually lose calls into the mountains . A little tricky to set up the cradle
5 #### It fit my vehicle like it aid it would . Aside from that , I do n't really know the difference between this oil filter and the next oil filter .
1 #### I do n't like this . I wish it had another strap to wrap around bcuz my bed rises up , and all of my items fall off on the floor .
4 #### Works with my Line 6 Unit just fine .. I ordered two so I could always have a spare ..
5 #### It 's working in the jack I topped off , no leaks .
5 #### with the help of some how to youtube videos it was n't hard to do . Screen works like new now my phone is just dropping calls
5 #### Its a zip tie . Not much more can be said about it . Why do I need 8 more words ? I ve said all there is to say about a ziptie ! O_o
5 #### I bought the blaster 2 because I redoing my entire top end and I wanted to replace the old coil and get something a better . when I saw it for $ 29 on warehouse deals I jumped on it . It works great .
1 #### These used to be great headphones . Wonderful sound ( well that s subjective , since everyone today loves a LOT of bass on their headphones -- hey I do too ) . These headphones do NOT have that heavy bass . They are really flat and balanced . I find that you need to have the volume higher than you 'd need on the in ear design headphones . I bought this to replace an older one where the ear covers ( ear muffs ) were disintegrating and falling apart . This is a normal result of these headphones getting worn or just falling apart as the plastic gets old . Sony where is the replacement part for the ear covers ? Anyways , the ones that I bought recently were made in Indonesia or somewhere other than Japan . The ear covers were sewn on all messed up . These went straight back to Amazon . I would have kept them if they were n't manufactured faulty and if they were made in Japan .
5 #### I have always been a big fan of Logitech . I previously used a Trackman Marble TOP , and was happy with this mouse for over 5 years . Then I found the Mouseman Wheel Optical , I had to try it ! When it comes to gaming , there just is n't a finer mouse ! The buttons provide a good tactile response to mouse clicks , and if your a rightie ( sorry lefties ) the ergonomic design fits nicely into your hand . And of course being and optical mouse as well as USB you have a high level of precision when it comes time to aim . Simply put I believe this to be one of the finest mice I have ever used , and there are not enough stars to give this mouse !
3 #### They are inexpensive and can clamp ( some ) coils for lowering . We used them to experiment with how much was enough lowering for our LeMon 's race van . Thicker coils require " clearancing " the clamps and the bolts are not long enough for many applications . Using spring compressors was the only way to get them close enough to attach . Quality is whatyou would expect for the price . In short , probably fine for very light gauge springs on lighter cars but applications are very limited .
5 #### Great product to clean and polish clear plastic headlight lenses .. BUT be sure to use a protectant or clear coat with anti - yellowing and UV protection to reseal the lens after the cleaning and polishing , other wise the nice new look will only last a short time .
5 #### I bought a pair of these and am very happy with my purchase . Your voice comes through loud and clear , and they are very easy to use for the novice . The only thing that could be improved is the antenna . The reception is great for communicating to nearby cb'ers but if you are out of line of sight they lose their clarity , and things get garbled . Also , you ca n't hear truckers any real distance away . This is an easy fix . I simply bought a 3 foot 1500 watt antenna to screw into the magnetic base for 10 bucks , and now I can hear cb'ers for miles and miles , and the airwaves are no longer silent !
5 #### I would recommend them . Great floor liners , I also bought the center hump protector . I have pretty much a full coverage protection in the front and I will be purchasing the floor liners for the back . If you need to have anything fit better just cut it . It cuts well , but is extremely strong . Fits pretty good in my 02 Chevy Silverado 1500 ext cab LS
5 #### This product is very nice looking and seems to be well designed . It 's easy to use and small and portable . Has sufficient power storage for recharging my phone a couple times on extended periods away from electricity . I am very pleased with the unit .
2 #### This really works great and stay stuck to the window . I have had mine for a while now and I 'm very happy with it . I would definitly buy it again .. I have changed my rating because although it 's a great concept it is not durable . I order two of these cell phone holder and the first one broke within a year and the second one I ordered was already broke when it came in .
5 #### Works great for solid core hitches thanks for the fast shipping also
5 #### Great amp , kick back , with music inputs ( from CD 's etc .... ) headphone capable . Nice sound . It will not rock a club , but that is not the intension . In fact if you had a couple of guitars , a sax , keyboards and drums you probably would be hard pressed to be heard ... if your working low volume with some acoustic guitarists and a singer or two it handles that with no problem . Nice tones . I like it . AND it 's VERY portable , but do n't be misled , it is not a featherweight amp it does have some mass .
4 #### If you like your guitars , find a beam to hang this from .
5 #### I have had this lens for over 7 years . I have used it with the Canon Rebel G , and will be shortly switching to the Xsi . This lens has a great zoom , and in good , outdoor lighting takes amazing , crystal clear , colorful shots . I shoot mainly wildlife . The detail impresses me everytime I get a shot back . This lens has made me love photography , and constantly strive to be better . I do not use this lens in indoor or low light situations . While I have never used a much higher end lens , I am very happy with this one .
5 #### I was ready to purchase a new player and decided to try this instead . My player would skip , would stop , and screen would go blank . This lens cleaner was delivered quickly and worked perfectly . I saved having to buy a new unitCouldnt ask for any more than that . THANK YOU :-)
5 #### For the price and quality of this case , you ca n't beat it . It 's built with a very solid belt clip and loop , so you do n't need to worry about it coming off . I 'm amazed you 're able to pick this up for about $ 7 . Quality is outstanding especially for the price . Leather grade is n't amazing , but it is what you 'd typically see for this type of product . My only concern was with getting my iphone out of the case . Grabbing at the sides does make it tricky to get the phone out , especially since it fits so snugly . I then realized the notch on the bottom . Simply push my finger there to lift the phone , and then pull it out . Works great !
4 #### No space in Yukon so just what I needed . Purchased an external speaker so works just like the big boys except for a little less range
5 #### Great brands at good prices , I always check amazon first before making a purchase online !
4 #### Love it .... needed one for each car so we do n't have to move from one car to another . Works as it 's supposed it .
5 #### Perfect for securing a 1700 pound boat on our trailer . Easy to install and functions smoothly . Would definitely recommend product for this application .
1 #### I did n't really expect too much from this case , and my expectations were fully met . If it fit a little tighter on the phone , I think it would work a tad better . There is no way you can access the charging port or SD card with this case on . It 's just not well made .
1 #### the lit rocker switch is poorly position , VERY easy to hit and thereby shutting off all power when plugging in near the switch . The switch is also easy to trip ; almost no finger pressure needed to turn off the unit . Furman makes pro level stuff and IMO items like this one tends to cheapen the Furman reputation
5 #### These are the good old studio essentials . Nothing better for the price . Will last you a lifetime .
5 #### I checked these items at local chain stores and found them to sell for almost twice the price that is offered at Amazon . I was afraid they might be a lesser grade . Happily I can say they were as good as any that I have seen . They looked great and worked perfectly .
4 #### I received the BlackBerry Curve 8900 Javelin Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera , GPS ... It is a good phone . It works .
5 #### This is the 3rd one I have purchased , these hubs are unreal . I have 3 external WD 1.5 TB hard drives hooked up , my cell phone , an ipad , a bose mini speaker and a keyboard . Hooked up to a Sony VIO laptop , and everything works without any lag time . I also have one hooked up to my server with 7 external hard drives , also no lag time . Very , Very Impressive . Highly Recommend ! ! !
4 #### I have never used it so I do n't know exactly how it works ; I just purchased it for a backup in case I need it one day .
5 #### This OEM holster is cheap and functional . The built - in magnetic sensor turns off the screen on my BB Curve automatically . The leather flap that goes over the top of the holster also can close itself . The " lock " is a strong low - tech magnet located on the end of the leather flap . This is an extremely smart and efficient design . It uses simple enough technology to keep the cost down . Definitely a cheap and functional trick .
5 #### This is a bright and powerful pickup . It is easy to install , and produces a nice clear signal . Its not a humbucker , so in certain situations there is a buzz ( if for example I 'm too close to a fluorescent light ! ) but If I 'm careful in my setup I can eliminate it . Since this is a passive pickup , it is even better when played through and LR Baggs Parametric Acoustic DI , or one of several other preamps that I use in my rig .
4 #### Works great- you do n't even need the power source . And yes , it works for my phone swimmingly . I just wish it worked with my tablet as well .
5 #### Well made , solid and matches my oak floors . Comes with 2 corkscrew anchors and goes up solid without having to find a stud . A great product .
5 #### Bought it for my Motorhome and I have a blast with it . If the air horns do n't get there attention this thing playing a song will . Works great when trying to get someone to let you in a lane in traffic .
4 #### I use this on our motor home batteries while the motor home is in storage . Easy to install and use . Automatic shut off .
4 #### I have been using this unit to fire my 430ex and 550ex flashes . It works flawlessly indoors . It can auto focus in complete darkness and the flashes do not need to be in line of site . Outdoors is another matter . It 's difficult to line up the sensors even at close distances . Not that it 's impossible , but it will require some patience .
4 #### did not fit vary well but works well good price
5 #### Good price . Fast shipping . On a commodity like this , what more can you ask for ?
5 #### My wife 's Yamaha classical guitar from the 70s was still being carted around in the 70s chipboard case , and we knew it was time for an upgrade . I looked at other molded cases but the price was big . I had initial concerns with the Gator because of the lower price , but this is one product that should n't be judged by price , it 's WAY nicer and sturdier than we had hoped for . The guitar fits very well ( it 's a standard classical like in the picture ) and there are no rivet heads or other sharp points anywhere inside . We could n't be happier . Oh , and it comes delivered in a HUGE box that our cat has attempted to make his second home . = - )
5 #### Pros : good price , small portable size ! Dual charging ports , 5200 mAh , has a light and laser Cons : ---- a little heavy but strong , the button settings need to be memorized It has been a life saver on campus when I do n't have time to go back to my dorm to charge my devices , iPhone , iPad etc .. Really recommend it .
5 #### I use this card with a Canon G1 camera . Have n't had a single problem . Stores 50 or so raw images . Downloads are fast and have n't had a single reliability issue . I like compactflash cards as they are much more sturdier and Viking Components did well on this one . I recommend this card for anyone who has a digital comera that takes compactflash cards
4 #### It is unfortunate the seller does n't offer a better deal if you combine shipping and buy two or more ... The item was shipped in decent time however I keep thinking they should do as some here do and make a slight discount if you buy more than one . We bought two because it is so easy to misplace these little things , it is amazing how easily you can lose them !
5 #### Excellent products and very good response rate , the shipment is fulfilled to perfection ! . New and very good products . Highly recommended !
5 #### I try to use only Motorcraft parts on my Crown Victoria so I went ahead and ordered this from Amazon as no local stores carry motorcraft . It did not come with new clips which you will probably break removing the old filter so keep that in mind .
5 #### The sax reeds was purchased for my student sax upgrade on reeds . The sax reeds works great , I and my student are very pleased with them .
4 #### Have had these type of rain guards on all of my pickups . Extremely easy to install . Just take your time . The quality is good . The only thing I do n't like is now I get some wind noise from these that I never had before . Other than that I like them . I can leave my windows down a little all year long if I want to and keep the interior dry .
1 #### Bought it for myself to use at the gym . The Distance is amazing even goes trough walls . But the volume level is terrible , it is very quite , no matter how loud you put it on the player and the bluetooth , the volume is just not enough . I do n't know maybe for some people it is enough but i do not recommend it at all .
5 #### Sounds great on throttle . Quiet when idling . Just the way I like it
5 #### Works great . no issues . the sticky did n't last long but that was probably my bad .
5 #### They work fine , with three sets will last long time ...
5 #### Works great .. installed under hood in my old Jeep Cherokee that is n't driven regularly
5 #### Great amount of grip , fits on nice and easily , looks great !
4 #### Owned 2 weeks : The only thing to cause me to stop short of 5 stars is the weight of the lens . Stabilization is great and worth every dime . Do n't even think about the other 75 - 300 mm non - IS version , it is junk - I tried it . You can hand hold this lens at 300 mm at 1/60 ! ! No kidding . Focus is fast and accurate with my Digital Rebel - almost no hunting like on the other 75 - 300 mm . You * must * get a skylight filter to protect the front element . I 'll update this review after a few months ' use .
5 #### I stick this on an earpiece and then stick it in my ear and it says , even when running . Good addition to my bluetooth earpiece !
5 #### The post come prelubed with dielectric grease - the whole thing looks very water tight when paired with Maxxima M85415R Hybrid Series Red / White Round LED Stop / tail lights
3 #### I used this speaker for less than 30 hours over a 5 month period . Today , the left earphone stopped working . This seems to be unnussually low durability to me
5 #### used memory foam to bring it out to size , for a 1967 camaro ( thin wheel ) . work perfect , nice grip .
4 #### I tried these to see if my fingers slid a bit easier than with the D'Addario 's I had been using . A little difference ( better ) . But the D'Addario 's Extended Play have a much better sound , especially new . For the first couple of days , they make my Taylor boom . And they stay loud longer than the Elixir 's . Actually , the Elixir 's were n't any louder new , than the old D'Addario 's I took off . I prefer the D'Addario 's . Some prefer the Elixir 's .
5 #### I Used this formula to clean my 14 year old mercedes manifold and head gaskets with out any trouble . It cleans the gunk and residue well and easily . There is not much of a sparkle , its mot corrosive , but it is as safe as can be since its a motor treatment ! ! ! !
4 #### Used for assembly of snow blower gear case reassembly after gear install after it snapped in two possibly from have a bolt instead of shear pin .
5 #### This deer alert just saved me , my family and the deer and our motor home from disaster . Driving back from camping good thing I saw this young deer crossing the forested highway , I turned on this alert , slowed down , put my brakes slowly , as you know motorhomes are like train , it does not stop on a dime but we noticed the deer walked faster and by the time our RV got closed it heard the louder alert and it ran faster on the side of the road . I would rather have something like this device than nothing at all when venturing deer area . I would install this on all my vehicles . I also have the whistle on the bumper , the deer did n't heard that .
5 #### If you thought a pick is a pick ( like I once did long ago ) you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and/or complexity . I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.14 mm Purples . Early on in my playing I was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better . Why ? After messing about I found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack . The interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give , or slackens when attacking hard . With a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility . I tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid ' 80 's . I like the Dunlops feel , grip , and durability . They hold up for a very long time . How long ? I have had some last a few years . They are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability . My students use them too , I do n't demand it , but I do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges . Highly recommended . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Finally found something to clean and polish my wife 's face shield on her motorcycle helmet . Works Great !
3 #### the spray bottle broke ... IT works but make sure to have another empty spray bottle on hand . I probably just got a defect . I mean both of em the air filter oil leaks as it sprays , and the cleaner spray just broke off when pressing it . but the chemical inside does its job .
5 #### This was exactly what I needed . Thanks for great product and great price . The product is sturdy and works well .
4 #### In it 's own world , the Rio is great . Just an MP3 Player with 65 Meg ram . Needs better headphones , although they feel snug and secure . Also , it would have been nice to have a recording feature with built in Mic or Input for a Lapel Mic . That would blow minidisk out of the water . I must say however that this is the future at its best . No moving Parts , removable Smart Media Cards used to expand memory . The Future of music does not involve any motors of any kind to spin a disk . I 've allready downloaded a ton of online books and music , and the quality is great ...... and remember , MP3 's can be be converted back to a standard .Wav file with just about any MP3 editor .... Try Music Match ...... A great product David_Carlin@vtel.com
5 #### Great strings that sound wonderful - use them all the time , after being stretched out I find them to hold their tune quite well against my playing .
4 #### It 's Okay , my son lik it and like the color , , blue is his color , he use it all the time .
5 #### I should have read the description that says " Green " ! My son and I was actually looking at the picture , we honestly thought it was multicolored guitar pick , again our fault , not the seller ! Other than that , no complaints ! It 's working like its suppose to .
5 #### Fits my legend perfectly . Prefer the magnetic closure , but hopefully it wo n't affect the battery life of my headset .
5 #### Nissan Altima Automotive Repair Manual : Models Covered : All Nissan Altima ... , the perfect tech help when you are DIY repairman , I would definitely order from this company again , thank you
4 #### This is a great case for the HTC Evo , let me start my thanking my gear and amazon on such excellent service ! The case is 99 % as described and probably the best protection for this style phone ( shy of an otterbox ) for its price . The 1 % not described would be the weakness of the gel skin . Like many other buyers of this case , I soon noticed how flimsy the gel compound was when I went to plug in my charger and head phones . Tears and discoloration are begining to developed around the flaps for the headphones and battery charge port . Keep in mind I only charged and used headphones 2 or 3 times . At this rate , they could be gone in a week or two . I think a slightly harder compound for the gel skin could have prevented this problem . Other than that , this is a great rugged case for this phone . P.s . , is this the case with the smell issue ? Cause it seems to smell like plastic/ burnt fish .
5 #### i use these almost exlusively for electric . amazing control of the tone . gone are the days of using five over drives to get different sounds . now its one drive and my pick . also , added bonus that , since they 're small and atypical as picks go , no one asks to borrow picks anymore . i lose about 75 % less picks now that i 'm not lending them out ( should say giving them out or throwing them away . no one give s borrowed pick back . )
5 #### I really love this case , fits my HTC EVO like a glove . Kept looking in the mirror with it , thinkin how fly I looked , LOL . And the best part of it all is the GREAT PRICE !
5 #### I own a Miata and had my shocks fail on me .. so I got stupid and bought a coilover kit , and once the overexcited mechanics installed the coilovers I lost the ability to work or raise the car ( yeah do n't mess around with your stock settings on your miata trust me .. keep it stock ... ) anyway raised the car back closer to it 's stock height but still had a real hard time changing oil on my car and I do not feel safe working on a car without extra jacks ... so it was pretty hard to find one that could fit under the fender on a low setting but these jack stands are great ... work flawless ... cheap and high quality . Great product !
5 #### I was impressed with the quality of this product . I use it to mount an iPhone in a Jeep CJ7 and it has been able to stay sturdy and hold the phone tight , even though you wo n't fine a much rougher riding vehicle . Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a very versatile car mount .
5 #### I am no fan of earbuds , the make my eardrums hurt and give me that " squishy / unclean / wet " feeling . So I 've got two sets for myself ( one for home , one for college ) and one for my mother , who shares my anti - earbud sentiments .
3 #### Pros : Holds iPhone 3GS well ( can even have a small silicone case on the phone and it will still fit ) . Good clip and great protection . Cons : It is not leather . It has a " leather TEXTURE . " Do not expect to receive an actual leather case . That being said , I would imagine this case getting unsightly pretty quickly . I got this for my mom , and she does n't even use it . Which is not due to the case being bad or anything . She just prefers her otter case .
5 #### I installed this on a 2005 gmc yukon denali xl . Simple installation with 4 screws going into existing holes . I had one of these on a previous suburban , and loved it because I felt like I was n't replacing the windshield as frequently . I drive on the interstates fairly often and get rocks thrown at the windshield . It probably does n't stop all rocks nor bugs , but I think it helps . It protects the front of the hood as well , but that 's not my primary reason for purchasing .
5 #### Perfect fit original equipment for my truck quick shipment . Get good quality parts for the price of lesser quality at the parts store
5 #### We got this fog machine to add a little atmosphere to our Halloween decorations and it worked very well . Pour the solution in and wait for a little while . A foot pedal lets you release as much fog as you need . no problems so far .
4 #### my 12 year old is permanently connected to her laptop via these RP - HT161 headphones . i 've tried a lot of under $ 20 padded headphones and these are my go to model . very good sound , pretty comfortable , good sound isolation from environment , good jack connection to macbook . they broke after four months which they all do with her so that 's not a strike against them . my one disappointment is the warranty : only 90 days . i 'm re - buying them , but this time , i will get the extended warranty .
2 #### A good concept , but hard to attach and then to get back off , and it 's very easily bent .
5 #### This wired remote is one of the most useful item I 've ever used . I frequently photograph night scenes at slow shutter speed . Camera is Canon EOS Rebel XSi attached with 55 - 250 mm telescope lens . This remote works exaxtly as standard shutter , such as half pressing to focus and mirror locking . To me , the wire length is perfect and I have no problem . One improvement I made on this unit myself is putting a fluorescent mark on the shutter button to help shooting in dark . I think the price is just right .
3 #### I bought a few of them and they 're working okay . The tape is still stuck to the floor , but it disconnected from the bottom of the yellow thing about 48 hours after installation . They do n't move around much anyway .
1 #### I bought the unit to add bluetooth to my car stereo . the unit shows up and only has a 6 foot cable on it . Great if you want the cable dangling across the windshield , junk if you want to actually install the unit in the car with no wires showing . Running the wires properly will place the unit right next to the drivers side window by the dashboard . Perfect if all you want to let your caller hear is road noise , bad if you want them to actually hear you . The cable needs to be an additional 6 feet longer to install it in anything but a tiny clown car . DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to actually install it where it belongs , on the visor .
4 #### This holster , Hector 4XL , works great with naked iphone 6/6s . I use it with a Spigen Tough Armor case , 145mmX73mmX12 mm . I do n't recommend cases bigger than that . The belt loop straps are weak . I modified the holster after one broke . The modified slots in the leather hold the case closer to the belt .
5 #### I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR OVER A YEAR AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS . THEY WORK WELL WITH NO SHAKING .
4 #### I was n't sure if this was safe to use on plastic recorders , but it is n't ( be sure to read things carefully , read within the instructions no use with menthol / alcohol Yamaha recorder soprano cream color ) . I use it on my Yamaha fife . Very clean and seller was kind enough to answer my questions . Very quick and reliable shipping .
5 #### Easy to use and works well , filter looks new was surprised how clean it came . Good price through Amazon cheaper than anywhere else I looked .
4 #### Nice size and great color code on the top . Works great .
5 #### Best headphones for the money . Bought my first set in 1989,which I still have . Did have to replace the ear pads . The black fake leather covering did seem to degenerate and flake off quickly . So did the exterior of the head band . Nevertheless , I will continue buying these headphones until hell freezes over . Can you use the word " hell " in a review ? If not there 's more where hell came from .
5 #### They fit perfectly on my Thule Load Bar , and the best thing is that I only lost one , so I can now sell the other three on Craigslist !
5 #### I had these headphones many years ago and they finally ' died' ... so naturally I wanted the same kind . The sound quality in these lightweight headphones is just amazingly clear and crisp ... they are my fave headphones !
5 #### Great for hiding cords along the baseboards . Ca nt even tell its there unless you are looking .
3 #### If your dvd is in perfect condition , this player does a fine job . However if your disk has even the smallest fingerprint , smudge or scratch- forget it ! This player can also be quite noisy with lots of noise from the drive and the laser mechanism as it tries to keep up .
2 #### This thing died after 12 months of use . before that it was great and paired nicely with my motorola S9 's . Range was fantastic also ( 100 ft ) .
2 #### I 've had 2 pairs from 2013 and they both had the same problems . The moving parts of the headband make clicking and knocking noises . It 's super annoying and I could n't find a way to permanently fix the issue . It 's a design oversight . The pleather covering of the earpads flake , badly , as many reviewers have pointed this out . It started after a year on mine . Replacing them costs more than half the price of the headphones , and would have to be done every year . No thanks . The sound is alright , but because of the above intolerable issues , they 're useless to me .
3 #### Wish I had purchased a size larger . The small size is a little bit too small of my pinky and it is an odd length . I am used to playing with my ole brass slide that covers all of the strings . This little glass one only covers 4 to 5 strings at a time ... which is n't that big of a deal considering i m usually only playing a few of the strings at one time ... its just a personal preference .
5 #### This is a real nice case that you can carry you headset in as well as cards and cash . Works with 3gs with a thin case but not the Otterbox .
5 #### Roland Smith 's account , one of life for a teenage English / American boy in Burma , is marketed as a story for youth . It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers ; however , this tale is equally interesting for all ages . Just because the main character is a 14 year - old boy , that does n't diminish the intrigue of this tale . At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father , I found this book particularly captivating . My father talked about the elephants , the native Kachin , Chindit , Naga , and Burmese peoples , the Imperial Forces , native built bashas , and the jungle and its wildlife . At 90 , Dad also found the book quite riveting . This account has outstanding character development , scene description , and intrigue . Highly recommended for all ages , 10 - 90 ! Elephant Run
5 #### Works as described and has a fairly long cord to keep the large plug out of sight .
5 #### I set up my old computer in the back bedroom for guests and when I plugged it into this device , it went right into the internet without a cable . It works great ! I 'm going to buy a couple more for other devices in the house .
5 #### I own three of these . There are heavy duty , and seem to be built to last . I especially like that they have no external vents for rain to get inside and potentially short things out . One of the three that I have is mounted on the outside of a trailer that is kept outside in the weather unprotected . It is subject to snow , rain , etc . but is still working fine in these conditions for several years now .
4 #### nice for small glasses , all my mother 75 , can carry now on her bird walks , works fine . great price for small glasses .
5 #### I love this case . The strap on the back allows carrying it over the shoulder or the straps in the middle if you want to hold it in your hand instead . I wish the side pocket was a bit bigger to put my reeds and cleaning supplies in , but it 's a great fit for a great price !
5 #### this product i asked a friend about getting and after i received it , it works better than i thought thank you
3 #### Its okay , and just okay . i would of spent another 70 bucks and got a decent mic . it does the job , but could be so much better .
4 #### Case Crown 's a fairly well - known company for quality . I ordered a few of these cases for myself and gifts . If one drops their iPhone screen first , there is a small ' bezel ' at the sides of the screen from the case , but it is not what I 'd call a really safe case in screen first drops . Having said that , the grippy coating on the case is nice and will prevent many drops anyway , by adding a sure grip of your iPhone . I 'll be ordering a few more as gifts so they 're good if * I * buy them :-)
1 #### Installed in my F150 using an optional wiring harness so I would not need to cut and splice the trucks wiring . Fairly simple installation , but I ca n't tell you about the features or performance , because it never powered up . Wanted this to work and spent hours checking and double checking connections . Still nothing . Will return and look for something else
5 #### THIS UNIT WORKED VERY WELL ON MY VHS UNIT ... I HAVE SINCE DISPOSED TO THE VHS PLAYER SO DON'T EXPECT TO BY USING THE HEAD CLEANER IN THE FUTURE ..... I WAS COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PURCHASE .
5 #### this is a good product , its features and applications . works as it should be . is compact , and easy to use .
5 #### I 'm happy with this phone so far . I upgraded from a 8120 Pearl and I 'm really glad I did . I 'll never have a phone without a full QWERTY keyboard again . Also , if you do n't have a data plan but would like to use WIFI you can upgrade your OS to 5.0.0.2 . Just Google for upgrades and find it . After the upgrade all the extra functions were available and the WIFI works great . So far so good . The transaction was handled well and the delivery was prompt .
5 #### I had these headphones in the 80 's when I could n't appreciate the value . I bought an extension cord to preserve these headphones because the distance from my head to the port on the PC is longer that the cord on these headphones .
1 #### Please read all the reviews on this product , several 5 star reviews are not even about this product . I m not sure how they got away with this ! !
4 #### I am about to purchase this item and after reading most of the reviews have to ask myself what do the past users expect . Of course the iphone , blackberry needs some sort of connection to the existing power source , after all this unit can not preform magic and simply send power through the air , through the iphone or blackberry case and magically charge the battery . It instead needs to be able to connect through the plug - protective case for the iphone / blackberry then it can connect to the powerpad using the magnet connection . As far as the concern about the magnet against credit cards , be prewarned that both the iphone and the blackberry already have magnets within them for the audio speaker , so not unless you are putting the iphone in your wallet ( must be a big wallet ) then use some common sense ... I am relying my review on the technical review from popular mechanics which at least addressed the technical side of this unit ... As far as the cost , think about it , we have three iphones in our home , mutiple ipods , psp and we are saving money on not having to have mutiple adapters just for the iphone ... I will follow this review up with a video review when i receive the item and try it out . If it does not work , well heck free return courier to amazon ...
4 #### Overall I 'm very happy with this phone . I 'm not a phone person but I was fristrated with my old flip phone as I had difficulty seeing the screen and working the keys . I 'm 63 and the eyes are n't what they once were . The phone is intuitive and once you have worked with it a bit very easy . Only issue I have with it is that the screen lock feature goes to standby pretty quick so I ca n't see the screen during a call . But that may be a setting I have n't found yet and as I said I 'm not a big phone guy . The air time credit was a bonus . A very good , workable gophone .
5 #### I own Pentax cameras . In comparing flash units , this one wins , hands down . I purchased a dedicated flash and 2 of these units . The dedicated flash was about $ 200 . These are about $ 85 . These have more consistent exposes and plenty of power . Simply set the camera on Manual and set the flash . I use them with the Cowboy wireless shoes . Over the past 40 years I have used various versions of the Vivitar 283 and 285 flash units . At one time I was shooting a wedding each week with a couple of them . I sometimes try other types of flash units , but always come back to these flash units . This flash is not expensive , but the 283 and 285 units are a true work - horses .
5 #### Nice pouch , high quality , looks and works great . Fits my iphone 3GS ( with cover ) perfectly . And you can use it either vertical or horizontal ..
5 #### Exactly as advertised . Sturdy , perfectly adequate zip ties . More white than " natural , " which I anticipated to be more of a khaki color .
4 #### The NOOK HD+9 ' exceeded my expectations and is becoming a valued household tool . The only small con is the shorter battery time . the resolution is great . Netflix looks FANTASTIC ! The 9 " screen size reminds me of the ipad but at more than half the price . Delivery was well within the prescribed time . I immediately bought a screen protector .
4 #### Been using these for years . I like the Regular Slinkies , too , but it seems these tend to last longer . Or , it could just be in my head . Either way , I am happy with them .
5 #### It serves the purpose I needed . It has a metal enclosure and it looks just as pictured . Very compact in size .
2 #### I do not know how anyone can say this product works . The commercials show a man using the product on a black sports car , and it dries like new . I have a black Cobalt and used this product for the first time today , in the shade , and in 74 degree weather . I followed to instructions exactly and after rinsing I noticed the soap had left a white film all over my car ! The water was drying spotless but the soap was n't . The water also was n't drying " before my eyes " either . I still had to end up going over my car with a cloth to remove the soap film . After I use all this I will not be buying a refill , if I even use it again . Luckily this was a gift or it would be going back to the store !
5 #### I 've owned many trailer locks but this one is the hook ! Once you put it on someone would have to use a saw or torch to take it off without a key .
5 #### Works great & you ca n't beat the price for aluminum .
5 #### I have a Sony CDP - CX255 200 CD changer and a Sony CDP - CX355 , 300 CD changer . The CDP - CX255 has worked well for years . In the CDP - CX355 , my CD 's have skipped , been scratched , and basically been unplayable on an intermittent level . I bought this CD changer for my extensive Symphonic and Operatic recordings . After looking at reviews , I decided to purchase the Pioneer PD - F1009 . I have never been happier with a purchase . It plays flawlessly with the most intricate music . I can finally listen to my recordings , secure in the knowledge that they will be played safely . After reading the reviews on these products , I can not understand how Sony can still put out such a poor piece of equipment as the CDP - CX355 . Thank you Pioneer for offering such a fine piece of equipment at a fair price . [ [ ASIN : B00004RDL5 Pioneer PD - F1009 301 - Disc CD - File Changer
4 #### Item arrived in good time . Planning 3000 mi . trip . Will be put to the test . Have used it as recommended in instructions and worked fine . Fan very quiet , nice fit behind seat , filled with 24 cans of pop that had been refriged and they stayed cold after 2hr . drive , and still cold in morning after sitting overnight with power off . I give this cooler a A+ on function , have not tried the heat mode yet , maybe next winter .
4 #### Easily installed and holds onto my iphone4 securely . I do run a rubber band around both just for an extra bit of caution , put the phone and mount stay put so far .
5 #### Strings have not been played a lot yet , but I have used EB products in the past with satisfaction .
5 #### It seems like a good product . Have n't used it yet . Turned it on but there was no one on the channels .
4 #### I really love this case ... you have to keep your phone face down all the time , but it 's pretty good quality . Some stones come off from normal use , unless you keep it in your purse all day .
5 #### I bought my Vivitar 285HV at least 20 years ago , if not longer . For the past 20 years , I used now and then . Shot some weddings with it . Did some portraits . For the most part , it was more a backup flash , than primary flash . I 've owned Nikon speedlights and Sunpak flashes as well . Six months ago , I began working as a mobile product photographer . I use a DSLR , 2 or 3 lenses , a Stroboframe flash bracket , and flash . I honestly do n't know why , but the first flash i grabbed was my 285HV . This flash was already 20 years old . I 've used it every day since . I shoot between 100 - 500 pictures every day . Every day . This flash is amazing . I 'll never give it up , and now I 'm thinking of buying a second one for backup . I have only one issue with it . When the battery power gets low ( I use rechargeable batteries ) , the color temperature dips dramatically . I do n't have a color temperature meter , but my guess would be anywhere between 3,800 - 4,200K. I can see this on the camera 's LCD screen . When that starts happening , I just pop in some fresh batteries . Super fast recycle time , coupled with ease of use , and you got yourself a workhorse you can rely on with confidence .
5 #### I LOVE these strings ! A lot more flexible than GHS Precision Flats which I used for the last 7 years on all my basses . Great tones , sustain and stay in tune . I use them on my Warwick Streamer 4 std Fretless with lineless ebony fingerboard . I 'd buy again and would highly recommend to anyone .
2 #### Looks to be well made but I am very disappointed that the opening of the top piece is too small to go around the ball joint stud on a 2003 Honda Accord . Just needs to be about one eighth wider to work . Had to obtain and use another tool to do the job .
5 #### For the price you ca n't go wrong . It fit nicely with out having to struggle to much . Lets see how it holds up , so far so good !
4 #### I have this attached to a 2 ' Firestik on my Jeep and it seems to work just fine for our trail runs where we 're within a mile of one another . I really do n't use CBs for anything more -- like long - distance chatter with truckers and whatnot . It 's got some cool features , but honestly , I have n't used them . Either way , this thing is good for what I use it for . Plus , when camping , we can go mobile with it . 10 - 4 good buddy .
5 #### this product does just what we wanted it to do . Received it quickly and was just what we expected- great price too
5 #### These are the BEST dusters ! ! I 've been buying been dusters for years now . I 've tried other brands but this brand is the best performing and longest lasting of the pack .
5 #### Does what it is suppose to do and I use it for a controller keyboard . I bought 3 ' because ti limits the ltency between the controller and computer . Going with a shorter cord has worked like a charm . Good product !
5 #### The construction is on the frail side but the sound reproduction is superb . It is lightweight and comfortable for long hours .
5 #### This is just the coolest , cutest little thing . I could n't be happier and it 's proudly displayed on my kitchen counter . Not sure how it works to keep the garlic longer just yet but will update you as soon as I know . Either way I 'll still use it because it 's just that good looking and very sturdy / well made .
5 #### The best sounding headphone I have ever had . This is my second pair ( wore the first pair out after years of use ) . These phones are for people who like a pure sound that seems to be flat across the sound specturm . The mids are clear and not harsh , the highs are distinctly easy , and the lows are as recorded by the studio engineer down to subsonic frequencies . To me , these sound as good or better than phones that cost several times more .
1 #### To be fair the item is described as a data cable but when searching quickly one can overlook the implication that this cable may not be suitable for charging an iphone especially since the technical details specify that it does charge . Indeed , it does not charge an iphone . Not clear to me why anyone would want a pure data cable .
4 #### Works well . Prefer a small pair of real wire cutters and a dedicated winder .
2 #### the case is a rubber case with a plastic support , that makes the rubber stronger . Not what I expected from seidio . Kinda junky .
5 #### My family has two houses , one in PA and one in AZ , and we stay at each one 6 months of the year , and drive between them . It 's a long trip , and this satisfies everyone 's power needs . It even has a car fuse in it instead of one of those crappy tube fuses you can never find replacements for . Best item ever ,
5 #### Yep , I 'm still stuck in the 90s too . If you 're looking for a starter film or a great all - rounder , look no further . Superia comes in ISO 200 - 1600 , so you can use it no matter the lighting condition . COLOR is AWESOME ! Pictures of red cars , green grass , blues in the sky ... all just POP ! I am a big fan of Superia for this reason . Clarity is great . No surprises there . Grain is ... I'll call it " classic " . You 're shooting film for this reason anyway , right ? Not too intrusive , not absent . Botch an exposure ? No worries ! Exposure latitude is great . You can definitely get good results a few stops either direction . Maybe my only gripe about Superia is it only comes in 24shot rolls . But I actually prefer that because I need to change ISOs more often than that , usually . Altogether , Superia is a great benchmark . There are films that are better in some ways , worse in some ways . But you can always find a reason to pack a roll of Superia .
5 #### Definitely what I was looking for . Loud enough to be heard in any situation .
5 #### When I first ordered this I ordered the wrong one because the website mislabeled the years that it was for . I purchased the 2405 which said it fits Ford 1992 - 2005 but I called the factory and it only fits from 1992 to 1995 . They are off by 10 years . I had to return it and then by this one the 2407 which is the correct one now . So , If you buy this for a van you may end up sending it back for the correct one as I had to do . The first one I had came with a leather ( probably not real leather ) bag but this one comes with a thin black cloth bag to put it in . It fits around my van windows and is easy to put on by myself . The only problem is if you want to get into the cap with this on you have to unhook it from the top corner of the door in order to open the door . It lowers the temperature in my van and gives me total privacy . When I used a blue tarp over my door a lot of people noticed it . This white cover is not invisible but most people do not notice it as they walk past my white van with the white cover .
5 #### I bought this can holder for my TJ . Served it 's purpose very well as I mounted it on the tailgate and removed the spare .
5 #### These work perfect . I used to have some on my pickup when I lived down south and have always had them on the car . When I moved up north I bought another pickup and only then did I realize how much I use these things . I like to keep my windows cracked and it stays somewhat cooler in the vehicle . The best part is when it starts to rain and everyone is running like crazy to shut their windows . I sit back and just enjoy the rain .
5 #### thanks a lot for the low price of the headphones , And they are more sturdy than other headphones . i like the brand ,
1 #### Even though these were advertised by Amazon to fit my Yukon they did not . This created a half day of extra work . to take them back off .
3 #### I bought this because it says it can be used on a l l/2 to l/14 " . Truth is it is much too large . Will try to use it on the other vehicle . But ca n't use it on the smaller hitch . Needs to be clearer in the description . I thought at first they must have two sizes but that is n't the case . Got ta find another way now .
4 #### I have dropped my phone on concrete from above my waist . The phone bounced and landed fine . It is " grippy , " fits the phone perfectly , NFC works while case is on , does n't dramatically change the phone 's size . The buttons work pretty good , but they are n't quite as sensitive . It looks good , feels nice , and protects the phone for like what $ 7 ? Best buy .
5 #### We buy minutes when necessary . This is a practical solution to seldom used but a safety comfort when traveling or separated by appointments or shopping . My wife uses the phone with ease and confidence . Me too .
5 #### Purchased a 2016 Mazda CX-9 . I wanted to seal the paint . Foamed it , two bucket washed , and used this to clay it . Worked well .used their qd spray with it . Pulled crap out of a new paint job . And sealed it with the Klasse twins . She shines .
5 #### Great case for the money ! Bought 2 cases from the same manufacturer ( one purple and this one ) and for some reason this one seems like better quality , even though they were the same price . If you 're not expecting a high - end / high - price case , I think you will be satified with your purchase !
5 #### It 's the original AC wall charger and USB cable with the silver dots identifying which side is the top . No issues , works great and the price is awesome .
4 #### Great volume pedal , does n't change your tone at different volumes . Very sturdy built . Only issue is it takes up a lot of room on a pedalboard .
5 #### Great deal for the 10 - pack . I usually have D'Addario as my third choice behind Ernie ball and DR , but this was too good of deal to pass up . Stringing them up I do n't had to stretch the stings 2 - 3 times and now they stay in tune pretty good . Not sure what else you could ask for given the price .
5 #### Second one I got and love it , from taping Xmas lights to it with duct tape . The tape damaged the first one.love it
3 #### Well , it * is * small . The disc diameter is 70 mm . I bought it to replace a rusty stock horn ( 80 mm ) on my ' 98 KLR650 . By using some of the included hardware and some of the bike 's hardware , it fit perfectly . It 's way louder than the rusty horn I pulled out , and it seems louder than a new stock horn , but not by a whole lot . The horn on my BMW bike ( 90 mm Hella , appears stock ) is definitely louder . In a nutshell , if you need a small disc horn to replace a really little stock horn , this is a great choice . If you have enough room and current for a larger disc horn or two , get those or a Nautilus . This is not much of an upgrade from a completely functional stock horn . This horn comes with the usual flat steel bracket plus a ground wire for vehicles where the horn grounds to the frame . For the price and size , I 'm definitely satisfied -- it fit where I wanted it and it goes BEEEEEP when I push the button . 3 * for the manufacturer calling it loud when it 's merely an average sound level .
5 #### Excellent buy . Less than 3 minutes to install . You should replace your fuel filter with every oil change . Then your oxygen sensors every 20000 miles . You wo n't regret those two and the 3rd , plugs and wires . Do n't let them get old . At least plugs yearly and wires every few .
5 #### Use it on all 12 of my guitars . People complaining about making your fingertips soft , if you read the instructions it helps to spray and wait a while for it to dry . If you spray it on and immediately start playing eruption yeah your fingertips will absorb the stuff in , easy fix is to wait a bit , let it dry and it works fine for me .
1 #### Horrible does not whiten white wall or writing on tire this is like just spraying water and whipping off .
4 #### So they 're flurocarbon strings , which is a fancy way of saying fishing line , but then again most ukes come with nylon strings so these are n't exactly exotic materials . If you 're not used to this style of string it 's worth trying , and this is probably a good brand to try since they 're good quality and affordable . Personally I like the feel of a flurocarbon string so after switching my ukes to some of the more expensive strings I decided to switch a laminate uke or two over as well and the Martins are just fine for this purpose . I have a couple of nits . One is that they were n't exactly generous with the length . I could have used another couple of inches just to have a little more wiggle room while stringing up a concert . And let 's face it , the base material ca n't be expensive at all . No need to be stingy with it . And the other is that I do n't feel like they 're up to the standard of the more exotic / expensive / newer strings out there ( Fremont , Worth , South Coast , whatever , basically any specialty string maker ) .
5 #### It does what it is supposed to do . I plugged it in , it works , and I do n't have to think about it .
2 #### Elixir Polywebs are not for most guitars , but in some cases they can help improve overly bright , harsh sounding guitars that need to be mellowed down a bit . Other than that I did n't like them at all on my guitars . So much for the Polywebs . However , the Nanoweb 80/20s are a whole different story . My all time favorite guitar strings are the Elixir 80/20 Nanowebs --it takes them a little while to break in , but once they do , they just get better and better ... and they last a long , long time .
4 #### In a way I think these headphones are TOO good ! First of all they are totally comfortable and I feel naked when I take them off , they are nice to just sit on your ears . They provide quite a bit of noise isolation so I feel like the music is right in the ears in a quiet room and I am finding I 'm missing phone calls and my tea boiling now when listening with these things ! The sound , as many have said , is a studio standard which can be good or bad depending on what you want out of a headphone . I find that when an album is poorly produced or lacking somehow it really shows up in the mix on here that was n't so apparent on other headphones of a lower quality that would tend to EQ and blend various ranges so it was n't as much of an issue . However you really do get the full audio spectrum on these babies and when you do hear very well produced music it is just amazing . Since I also record music and do n't have decent monitors I am hoping these will service for mixing for my amateur purposes so such quality is welcome and is why I got them , but might bug other folks who are used to other types of headphones . For $ 60 purchase price though I am a fan !
4 #### I bought the 8x21 . The image quality is good . Overall good quality .
5 #### The benefit of coated strings is , as the box says , longer life . This is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural " life " , i.e. that brightness that new strings have . The drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating - they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity strings . So are these any good ? Yes , they feel great , not overly slippery or coated , and sound great , though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings . I 'm excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player I change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longer . About gauge . These light strings go from .012 to .053 as compared to my old Martin 's which went from 0.012 to 0.054 . In summary , D'addario makes good strings and these are no exception . If you 're looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted ( as opposed to aggresive ) tone with lighter low E , then you should check these out .
5 #### Finally , a company that made blind - side mirrors that actually work . You will not be disappointed on how great these work .
3 #### What I like : It seemed to react well when tuning . It will beep when your note is dead - on . Good size . Fits in my Boss pedal rack line up nicely . What I do n't like : Screen is not easy to see . Text is thin and with very old school Font . Metronome : ca n't really hear it even if I 'm strumming lightly . Big failure as a metronome . Also , adjusting the tempo is a tedious procedure . It should have had a wheel or a tap - tempo feature . They sell this today but it feels and sounds like something from 1980 . Like ... My first digital watch .
4 #### works great , the only reason it gets a 4 out of 5 is because i think the neck is to small and hard to adjust . other than that it 's a good product . Juan
4 #### The phone is sold from T - mobile here in the USA and comes in red and black , the phone is very light , the phone includes everything you know and love from blackberries including wifi , pin messaging , web , email and other pda - like functions . The 8220 runs on the 4.6 OS but the stock software from T - mobile 4.6.0.180 can be slow and jerky because it runs on the older arm 312Mhz processor but I would recommended anyone with this phone to upgrade to 4.6.0.122 which seems to be the fastest most stable version thus far . The phone does n't really live up to the build quality of other blackberries but many can overlook that and accept the fact that it is the first flip from blackberry and they did a good job with it . Operating system : 4/5 Build Quality : 3/5 Features : 4/5 Battery Life : 5/5 Overall : 4/5
4 #### This type of fiction is not my usual fare . However , it was well written , and drew from mythology , as well as various belief systems . Offered as entertainment and not intended as persuasion . A good read .
5 #### Great polish and cloth , that leaves my guitar clean and without fingerprints .
5 #### Ordered this hoping it would work for my Nexus 4 and it is working great . I do like the fact that I can use it as USB charger or wall charger , depending on my needs .
1 #### I could n't get this to work with my phone . No instructions and the screws were so tiny you 'd need to be a surgeon . I ended up breaking my phone 's LCD totally trying to fix my phone . So that was a total waste of time and money for me .
5 #### The tortex .50 is my go to guitar pick , it 's light enough to strum and heavy enough to pluck .
5 #### This product is absolutely awesome , wash my car with nu finish and wow what a difference .
5 #### No More Green Card In The Mail ! Just A Receipt ! Pin / Phone # ? Loaded That In Tracfone ! Then Sent That ! Response Was So Quick ! Like Over Before Getting Started ! Awesome ! Another Worry Free Year ! Thanks Amazon ! What 's Not To Love ! .One Year Later ? ? Another Repeat Success ! Easy Love ! 3/18/17 ? Thanks Again Amazon !
5 #### The case was n't what I wanted but the company gave me a full refund when I said so in my review
3 #### Some screen protectors are thicker than others , and some are thin as Saran wrap and suffer from air bubbles . My Review : I ordered the screen protector from the vendor SF Planet . The screen protector is clearer and thicker than I expected . It looks like the picture , fitting the BlackBerry Curve 8350i like the original protective covering . The product is thick enough that with care a user may only need one during the lifetime of their telephone . The two step approach to applying the sticky screen protectors is superior to many , and no bubbles . I found this product to be very easy to apply , fairly thick , and crystal clear . A little eyeglass cleaner and a soft cloth will easily remove any oily finger smudges - it is good as new . POSITIVE : - Thick for durability and no bubbles . - Very clear . - Easy to attach . - Easy to clean . NEGATIVE : - You may choose to ignore this comment - it is a personal preference . This product , like the original screen protector , covers more than the screen , it slightly overlaps the body of the BlackBerry . Depending on how one handles their cell phone , I can see how the edges could pry loose prematurely . If that happens to you , try trimming the protectors to the exact size of the screen .
4 #### Mirror works well for helping me see when I get my daughter up on her wakeboard , or when pulling a tube . You do lose sight of riders as they pass far to the right side of the boat , since your body blocks the view . This may be solved with a wider mirror , but I 'm not sure . Attachment points seem a little weak , but we have had no problem with it so far . You do get a fair amount of vibration in the mirror , but I suspect that this would be the case with any mirror . Good choice for the price .
5 #### I bought two packs and I , m putting them on my al 2000 and my douglas.great job gibson . Les is still the best .
1 #### Advertised to fit the Venture series ( as well as others ) , but it does n't . The Venture series that have micro SD slots have a slightly different back , so this will not fit it . ( The card slot is in the way . ) It was a complete waste of money .
1 #### Threads seized up after 4 uses damaged threads beyond use
5 #### This battery arrived safely packaged and with almost half charged . When installed it charged quickly , and seemed to hold the charge well . Does n't overheat any more then usual , and everything seems to be in order .
3 #### It 's ok . The magnet in the flap is not very strong and has allowed my phone to slide out on several occassions .
5 #### Used this in my boat to remove rust . I fish in a saltwater environment . While this product works , it does still require some elbow grease to work . I would buy again .
5 #### Literally makes your ragtop look brand new , no joke . I highly recommend this product to everyone with a cloth top
4 #### Very nice for the price . They look even better in person .
4 #### These " very light " picks turned out to be too flexible , even for my Martin acoustic . The quality is acceptable , they 're just too thin for my taste .
4 #### The product is great , but the aerosol makes a mess all over the can and your hands when spraying . I recommend buying a gallon and a decent manual spray bottle and doing it the old fashioned way .
5 #### I wanted a wall charger so I could charge my extra battery separately from the one in my phone ( HTC EVO 4 G ) . I want to have a backup battery ready if needed on days when I 'm out and about with no chance to plug in the phone anywhere for a recharge . I tried a cheap AC charger , but returned it ; the contacts were flimsy and after hours plugged in , the battery was n't even fully charged . This unit looks and feels like much better quality . It 's not blazing fast but after a few hours plugged into the wall , the battery is fully charged . Its finish and performance far outshine the cheap five buck unit I tried , and at about twenty - three bucks it was still not ridiculously expensive . I have n't used the USB cord or setting , and do n't think I will because I have my phone 's OEM USB / AC cord and plug .
4 #### I love this thing . It 's small , light , and fits great in my laptop bag . I had been looking for a backup supply for my cell phones for a while now and recently purchased this one . It works great . I 've been able to charge my phone numerous times on one charge of this battery pack . I do n't have an iPad , but actually recently used this to power a friend 's . I recommend it . I was n't really crazy about the USB cable that came with it . But hey , I did n't buy this thing for the cable . ( It 's actually one cable with two adapters that plug into the end . One for USB mini , and one for USB micro . ) I would definitely recommend buying it , and I 'm considering getting another one .
5 #### D'Addario strings are awesome ! These strings speak with a bold , defined and POWERFUL voice . The bass strings boom with thunderous lows and the treble strings glisten with sparkling highs without being too harsh . They are very sweet to the ears and tonally balanced across the board without one frequency overpowering the other . I have tried a lot of different strings , DR 's , Ernie Ball , Dean Markley , Elixir , GHS , you name it . After putting a set of EXL110 's ( 10 - 46 gauge ) on my Gibson SG special faded and comparing them to Ernie Ball I noticed a huge difference , not only were they brighter but they lasted longer . I used to change a set of Regular Slinkys every two months but with EXL 's I was changing strings every five to six months . They work in a variety of applications , metal , hard rock , jazz , blues , reggae , etc . and respond great at any dynamic level . D'Addario is " The Player 's Choice " for a reason after using these I ca n't see myself using anything else ! They feel good , sound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set . If you have n't used them yet , give 'em a try and see what you 're missing .
4 #### I can feel a difference in my car after Seafoaming .
5 #### Great Case . Cheaper buying it here than through a music store .
3 #### Harsh on the fingers for me as a Player but they sound good .
5 #### Very good price and very good delivery time ( 2 days ) . I would order from them again .
5 #### Purchased for use on a Shindaiwa C3410 brush cutter and T260 string trimmer , after I fit each with a grease fitting at the gear case . Works !
5 #### Have done two different truck floors ( ` 82 " Dodge Ram Dually Crew Cab and ` 76 Ford van ) . This stuff is amazing . I ground off as much as I could but had to leave some rust colored ground metal . I slathered on the Rust Bullet with a brush after cleaning the floor pans thoroughly and Rust Bullet sticks like mad ! Hardens and is very wear resistant . Always use with a respirator . Soooo much easier to use Rust bullet for light to severe surface rust . Will definitely use again and buy again . It 's worth the money !
4 #### Works well .. not too big .. just the right dimension .. nice for added safety when braking and adds some light when just driving down the road . Ca n't beat the price ..
5 #### Works great . Hope it lasts a long time . Time will tell .
5 #### This product is a lot smaller than I thought it would be , which is a plus . It seems to function adequately , time will tell if it holds up ! It fits just fine into my honda odyssey .
1 #### The plastic used is utter rubbish . About 50 % wo n't latch , and about 10 % break in the middle ! In 30 years I 've never seen such junk .
1 #### I had a bad experience with my Bushnell purchase , and the customer service at Bushnell is terrible , you just receive form emails back all the time .
4 #### It 's Cat 5 cable as advertised , and cheaper than anything else you will find . Just the length I needed for wiring part of a small system of networked computers and similar in performance to other Cat 5 cables in the same ecosystem . I do n't particularly care for the clips on each jack , they are not horrible but are a bit twitchy to plug in and unplug . Not a huge deal , but the one less than ideal aspect of this cable . Ca n't really complain too much about it for the price .
5 #### Simple and quick to install . Was everything it said it would be .
5 #### Works great . I used it in my 2001 GMC Sonoma to remove the door window handles . Quick and easy once you understand how it works .
5 #### I had never tried these before . Nice flats at a better price . Very smooth . I would compare them to Chromes or GHS . Slightly lighter guage . They also have a heavier gauge . A bit more pull than a round wound set so i went a tad lighter and they work great . Try out a set and see how they make your bass thump and sound smoother without all the clanky string noise * unless you like that sound * .
2 #### Worked great for a couple weeks , and up until that point I agree with the other reviewers . However , skipping got worse and worse , then it would freeze , and finally , after inserting a disc it would tell me to insert a disc . It stopped working entirely on any DVD or CD . Too bad . My old SD2107 never gave me a problem in over 3 years . Maybe I just had bum luck , but another reviewer noted needed it cleaned after several weeks .
5 #### I 've tried several other brands , including synthetic , but these are the first clarinet reeds I 've purchased that ALL played well right out of the box .
2 #### This is a 710mAh battery . The original , stock battery in a Razr V3 m is 780mAh . This battery is less powerful and will provide about 25 % less run time then the stock battery in the Razr V3 m. Check your battery mAh rating first , it 's marked right on the battery .
4 #### The old trusty 75 - 300 . This lens is a great starter , regardless of your skill level . Glass is solid , lens is well built , images are crisp . Beleive it or not , I found this lens most useful for video . We 've achieved some great bokeh and really crisp scenes with this lens over the years . Most enthusiasts and pros will talk your head off about L glass . Do n't look past this lens , it 's been trusted for quite some time .
1 #### I bought several of these as a workaround for cases that have too narrow a plug hole on the iphone5 I also started using them to protect constant unplugging of my itouch & headphone jacks that were too large . After a few days one side shorted out & it was the adapter connection that had frayed even though it was never removed by wire - always carefully handled ... i replaced it w a new spare but several weeks of trying to figure out what the sound quality problems were with new headphones and whether it was a ripping/ download setting .... finally discovered the distortion & thin sound was this adapter ! ! I used another since i had a third i had yet to use and same result ! ! These are crappy sounding adapters that might allow you to plug in a headphone for a week or less but also GREATLY compromising sound quality !
3 #### they fit as described , they do scratch and they come off without leaving a film , works fine for what i use them for ( used under my otterbox for double protection )
4 #### Takes up a bit of room , but does the job , holds iPhone 6 and 6 plus
5 #### Great product ! Fast shipping ! I would buy again : )
5 #### I got these by mistake when ordering , these 80/20 will be my strings from now on , on my seagull entourage . They make this guitar even more amazing , as they make it much louder and very distinct sound .
5 #### Simple tool that will speed up string changes etc . 2 settings for neck width .

I 've ruined several knives and spoons because they made their way into the garbage disposal when I was n't looking . When I turned the garbage disposal on , the ensuing noise let me know that something good was not happening . This little tool solves that problem and also ensures that I am able to safely push food stuff into the garbage disposal without accidentally trimming my nails or fingers . It 's a simple plastic insert that can stay in place in the garbage disposal opening when not being used . When in place , It 's raised up just enough to allow water to drain easily . But when you do need to use it to push food into the disposal , just pick it up using the permanently attached handle and it 's ready to jump into action . The only thing that may bother some people is that the handle is fixed and will always be sticking up about an inch ... it does not fold down . That does n't bother me in the least . It might be nice if this came in a few more colors . I do like that it can be cleaned easily by tossing it in the dishwasher . I think this should be included with all garbage disposal purchases . It 's just great .
5 #### I have used this product for about 15 years on RV 's and Generators . About once a year I spend several ; hours on internet research also and , PRI - G always comes out near the top or , at the top . I just passed Calif Smog Test with flying colors , running 4 year old gas that I retreat each year as mfgr . states
5 #### On our walks , my dog Teddy likes to minutely inspect all trees and surrounding area for squirrels to chase . This leaves me standing around with nothing to do ; so , I thought I 'd get a portable radio to listen to . The RF - P50 by Panasonic works very well picking up the NPR station on FM and the local News - Talk AM stations that are each about 20 miles distant . It also picks up more distant stations , some 100 miles away , with varying degrees of static . The nearly identical Sony ICF - S10MkII portable that I bought at the same time works just as well .
5 #### AFTER PLAYING A FEW YEARS NOW , I FOUND THEY ARE JUST THE BEST STRINGS OUT THERE ... THEY ARE RATED THE HIGHEST BY REVIEWS OF ANY STRING IVE SEEN WHICH SAYS ALOT ... VERY GOOD AND THEY ALSO DONT MAKE THAT ANNOYING STRING SLIDE NOISE , WHICH IS JUST ANOTHER REASON ....
5 #### Put this on my DR-100 and they were super comfortable and I strum hard and they still feel new after daily play for a month .
4 #### I have tried almost every kind of headphone and somehow could never get ones to a. stay in my ears , b. not hurt my ears , c. keep the quality of sound from my ipod . I purchased these headphones for myself to use at the gym so I can keep them in my ears and the plastic wo n't hurt me after a bit of use ( like most do ) and my husband took them and fell in love with them . He used them all the time and had them with him camping and sadly lost them in his camp fire so we purchased each of us a pair the second time .
2 #### I purchases with the belief that the clip with the 3 M adhesive would not come off after following the directions to clean surface thoroughly with the prep pad then to hold for three minutes and allowing 72 hours to cure boy was I wrong After 15 minute use clip came detached from phonecould be due to the metal clip was discontinued and adhesive was old but I 'm certain I will be trying a different product The clip it 's self is nice the flaw is with the adhesive
5 #### that 's the perfect not expensive , very light , however , not sounds like crap . but she attracts dust so much . should wipe or clean frequently
5 #### Great solution to the accessory space problems with music stands . Just the thing for pencils , guitar slides , picks , bows , and all sorts of other musical objects d'art .
5 #### Love the old Nook . I bought as back up in case the original one stops working . Samsung is too different and too expensive .
4 #### This is a good , high quality USB cable . Not much more needs to be said .
5 #### I 'll never be famous but I look famous with this great addition to my guitars . What a great idea instead of lacing strings onto straps .
5 #### I read about JazzTone picks at the Jazz Guitar Forum and ordered a half - dozen in several sizes . This is my favorite , and I 'll be ordering a bunch more now that I know that I love it and it makes me sound better . This pick is fast , and unlike picks with sharp edges , it never ' hangs up ' on a string . Also , it does n't " clack " when playing rhythimg the way pointy - headed picks tend do . Very smooth and steady . It 's the smallest pick I 've ever tried and that 's a big plus for me . It does n't get in my way and it 's easy to hold so that only a bit of the tip shows . It has a better feel in my hand than , say , a Jazz III does . ( I played Jazz IIIs for years and like many things about them . ) It 's thick without being clunky or slick . My first thought upon using it was , " Why have n't these always been around ? This is the greatest guitar pick I 've ever used ! " ( And I 've used more kinds than I can recall . )
5 #### The little clip that holds the cord into the detector is just as fragile as on the phone cords at home , and with the added heat exposure eventually will break , especially if you do not exercise reasonable care . I yanked on mine , it snagged under the seat , and I paid the price . Duh . Cheaper than on the manufacturer 's web site , and free shipping from Amazon is great too .
4 #### Simply put , I used it to replace another cable that the dog chewed . It works great , and the phone charges . Ca n't ask for much else .
3 #### Believe it or not , some of us still use VHS Only because we are digitizing them now . Converting an analog tape to digital media takes its toll on a VCR and the heads get dirty beyond recognition . Eventually I 'll have to tear down my deck to clean it properly but for now this cleaning tape really helps
4 #### Good product to protect your phone from scratches . The downside is finding a case to fit the pearl with the skin on . I would also like to see it fit just a tad tighter on the phone . After time being on the phone it tends to loosen up a little .
5 #### These are a wonder accessory for any guitar player . My daughter loves them and they are easy for her to old with smaller hands than an adult she can easily grip them . They are easy for her to use .
1 #### Did not work with our galaxy 4 phone ! It only works with some networks . I did not see that before ordering . Beware !
5 #### great for the filter and for cleaning out your water gravity bong the chemicals inside do n't burn your skin and smells good too
5 #### used before 3 m 39030 synthetic wax . a little labor intensive , but worth using to prep for aquality wax .
5 #### I bought this to test a dead Jawbone Prime ( eliminating the cable as the faulty point ) . The device still would not charge even on this cable . I knew then it was the device . I returned it to Jawbone ( who have fantastic customer service by the way ) and when I got the new device , this cable worked fantastically . Its hard to leave a fancy review for a cable that just worked but needless to say , if you need this cable and buy it , you wo n't regret it .
1 #### The connector above the volume buttons broke after 2 months ... * sigh * . Was hoping this would last at least half a year , guess not .
3 #### This is a good standard telephoto zoom with solid , but average performance . This particular lens features Canon 's micro Ultra Sonic Motor ; therefore , it does not have the same focusing performance of the standard USM designs . Optically , it is the same lens as the EF 75 - 300 III , and performs roughly the same . Usually , this lens retails for more than the non - USM design , but I 'd pay little more . An oddity on Amazon has often had the price of this lens lower , and that 's a good deal . As previously stated , the lens is a solid performer . Good lens speed , but not as fast of focusing as the EF 100 - 300 . Additionally , the front of the lens rotates , which is not as nice when using filters such as polarizers . The plastic barrels are OK , but zooming is a bit less smooth than desired . Canon also does n't include much with the lens . A lens shade is very useful for outdoors photography , and Canon is very pricey on an accessory that most include . Canon 's one - year warranty is also poor compared to most others . For a good alternative , look at the Tamron / Promaster 70 - 300 LD lens which has closer focusing , includes the shade , and both offer longer warranties . However , neither are as quiet as the Canon lenses . For an upgrade , look at the Canon EF 100 - 300 USM , which offers a smoother , faster USM , and no filter rotation .
5 #### I 've been using this trackball at work for six years and I love it . I work in a 3D cad program that is primarily controlled by the mouse so it gets worked hard all day , every day . This track ball never skips a beat and is comfortable to use , I find standard mice to be fatiguing . After more than twelve thousand hours of use the primary left button has given out on me . The switch still functions but the button has broken and does not move anymore . I am very disapointed to find that logitech no longer makes this trackball , I will be replacing it with a used one from ebay .
5 #### product as described product works great convenient 10 pack comes with valve stem core removal tool attached on each one . Fast shipping .
4 #### Only a couple of drawbacks ... otherwise great . 1 ) The headphones plug into the charger port . I want to be able to charge my phone and use the headphones at the same time . 2 ) I want different sizes of earpieces . The soft - gel earbuds are removable , but there are no options for different sizes of ears . Other than this ... amazing item . Great sound and works perfectly for internet streaming , listening to music , or talking to someone hands - free .
5 #### A must have to replace the sponges in my Acoustic Guitar Humidifer .
5 #### It literally took 5 minutes to get this set up and working . I have an Xbox 360 in a separate room from my internet router and was looking at options to connect the Xbox to the internet to use Xbox live , etc . This looked like the perfect answer . I prefer not using wireless for the increased security / speeds and this is perfect . This adapter encrypts the communications and is fast . I watched ESPN on the Xbox and saw no lagging / buffering . The only downside is that Belkin suggests you plug these adapters directly into the wall ( makes sense ) but it is sometimes a bit difficult to find an open wall outlet . If you are looking to extend wired internet to someplace in your home I would highly suggest this product .
5 #### These are GB brand tie wraps . Good flex and good quality .
5 #### All wires are labeled , once connected with the wiring harness that comes with the new stereo it plugs right in to the factory wiring . No cutting , splicing , or other mess . Great product .
5 #### What can be wrong with a cable ? Nothing . That 's what I meant .
5 #### This ramp kit exceeded my expectations . Everything about it is top notch quality . The ramp tops and bottoms are heavy gauge aluminum and will outlast any board you put in them plus they come with high quality grade 8 hardware for installation . I 'm very pleased and would recommend this kit to anyone . Great product for a great price .
3 #### The sound quality was great ; but after only a few weeks of use ; between my phone and laptop , the tip of the smaller cord jack broke off , inside my phone .
2 #### This capo was great for the first few weeks I had it . I then realized that the spring inside it became a lot weaker , and loose . Now it is difficult to get it to hold down the low E string .
5 #### Got this stuff to put on the under - side of the saddle bags on my Triumph Street Triple with high exhaust after burning a whole in one bag -- heavy load pushed the bag down and into contact with the exhaust , rather than the heat shield as intended . Covered the bottom and inside of the bags with this thermal covering , and it works perfectly . Highly recommended !
2 #### Excited about this based on good reviews , but did not have the same experience . Tested on my Nexus S cell phone , person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound . I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell , and they said the problem went away , so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset . Also , just FYI , this does not come retail packaged , but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions . Not a problem for me , but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality .
5 #### I knew that I SHOULD vacuum the system first , but I do n't have the equipment . I decided to give it a try and see what happened . I added another can of refrigerant after using it as my system was empty . It is doing great for the past 4 months and its been a long hot summer .
5 #### Application was easy - tabs worked . Better than previous screen protectors , now have to see how it will go in the long run .
5 #### Finally transferred home Videos From the my old sony video camera to my lap top , Excellent quality cable the price so perfect
5 #### This Charger Has Lasted For Almost A Whole Year Without Any Problems . I Do Have A Lifeproof Case & Since You Have To pull The Cord It Did Make my Loss . But It 's Still Working .
5 #### not as great as the otter but excellent .... fits the 3 g peachy ... has a nice feel and is certainly worth more than what i paid for it .... is this 20 words yet ? ? ?
5 #### Works wonderful and it does n't have the ear thing that goes into the ear hole which is what my wife did n't want . It 's great for the price and I have no complaints . It even comes with stickers that are colorful you can decorate it with !
5 #### Item did n't serve a purpose I needed but customer service was amazing
2 #### I can pair it to my one phone but then I go and pair it with a second phone and it tells me that they ca nt find the second phone to pair ....
5 #### Fits great , comes with all the info and manuals for connections , read your audio makers manual identify the cables and voila it connects to the Nissan Altima like magic , great product even for newbies !
5 #### Tried one set then bought a bunch . I play a Ramsey 12 " with a calfskin head . YMMV ...
5 #### I 've bought 4 of these over the past couple of years . I wanted a stand that is pretty solid but also had a clamp to hold the guitar that I could use one handed . It gives me piece of mind that somone wo n't just brush up against a guitar and damage it . I 've noticed that it has been backordered on several sites , so I expect that there are a lot of other people who really like it too .
5 #### It worked better than expected . I would definitely recommend this product to those who needed . If I had to buy is again , I would !
5 #### I 've had these since November , and they 're great . They 're comfortbale and the sound is the best I 've heard out of headphones in awhile . The cord is a bit long , but it 's nice to have when you want to step away from your computer or iPod .
1 #### This is for very specific phones , and not the iPhone . My 4S fits terribly in there . Wish I had n't bought .
2 #### Good quality , just a hair too small for Chevy Malibu wheel , tore during installation .
5 #### Fast shipping and hassle free ordering ! Great product ! Will order again !
5 #### This case fits my Epiphone Dot perfectly and has held up for almost a year now , even while being left outside in a small rain one night . BUY IT
5 #### I bought these because I have used the identical plugs in the past . They are just the best .
4 #### If you want a case that you can put your phone in to keep it from being damaged while out in the elements , this is it . It works in just about every way possible . I 'm pretty sure that unless you ran over your phone or dropped it overboard on a boat this case would protect it . Screen is nice and clear and all functions can be used without henderence . Only one complaint . The screen has small air bubbles between the phone and the protective screen . Not a big deal but it does detract from the looks of the phone ...
4 #### Is the very confortable , the sound is great people do n't realize you 're using a headset , great sound quality . You can hear music ( loud ) and still voice command your phone and WORKS really something good .... just the buttons are really difficult to handle , they 're very hard and difficult to find and use .... something more sensible would be great for these product ... But I 'm very satisfied with it
5 #### Ahh ! At last no IGD aka Inner Groove Distortion . I kicked a Ortofon 2 M Red to the curb because it seemed like the last 5 minutes of most EP / LP 's were too distorted to enjoy . Based on other reviews and recommendations I switched to this . No more IGD as mentioned . I have now used this on a Project Carbon ( former 2 m Red ) , MusicHall MMF 7.1 and Technics 1210M5 G all with great success .
4 #### This is a good kit for fiberglass maintenance . It still requires a lot of physical effort for the final buffing to get a nice shine . Regular maintenance recommended , not letting it go too long between cleanings .
5 #### A lil awkward for some . But works perfect for me . Like any other tool , it does n't always fit or please everybody . But I 'm a big fan of all - in - ones . So this is a more compact option for me & less clutter inside my guitar case pocket .
5 #### Exact match to old battery . Seem to be working well so far .
4 #### Bought it for the car charger and the case . We have used the charger for a while now , and so far so good ( very good considering price ! ) . The case is a little bulky , but it fits right ( although do not expect to be able to remove it easily ) . The protective film is ok , although a little bigger than the screen and challenging due to some curves in the border of the screen ( it lifts ) , but the case keeps it in place . Have not tried the cable yet ...
5 #### Another great addition to my guitar repair toolbox . I Love It ! Planet Waves does it again !
5 #### An old standby that just does n't let you down . I 've purchased a few very expensive capo 's in the last few years . I just keep coming back to these .
5 #### I added a Hosa ' on / off ' switch to the xlr connector that clips to your belt to make this an outstanding mic . Clean , clear , and easy to wear for hours . The mouthpiece is easy to adjust and stays in position without a hitch . No more peeking around mic booms to see my music . Well done Shure !
5 #### it really works , but it did n't last long . the rubber started to loosen and we had to order another one .
5 #### I customized my Stratocaster , and I never thought to use than other Fender original replacemets , they are cheap and works at the best with your guitar .
5 #### This case is wonderful . I like the secure belt loop and magnetic closure . I have tried several cases and this one is the best !
5 #### I have played guitar for 50 years and have never used a better string winder . It is easy to use , small enough to conveniently pack and durable . I would recommend it strongly to anyone .
4 #### These are REALLY expensive , but really nice ! It 's all about the image stabilization . It 's amazing the difference it makes . This is actually the second pair Canon IS binoculars we have - that 's how well we like them . We watch a lot of wildlife .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Belkin . I 've been a customer for years and I highly recommend their USB 2.0 Cables .
1 #### These were on sale half price , when I got them they were open and the screws and lock washers were missing . Someone apparently had installed the buttons on their guitars then sent back the locks . I sent them back and got a quick refund then bought some Fender Strap Blocks . They are just rubber washers that stretch to fit over the strap holder behind the strap . Much cheaper and fit any guitar without having to drill and install new strap buttons , and they work great . Save your money .
5 #### I had my teleflex steering leaking for quite some time now . Installing the seal kit was a breeze and so far I had no leaks . excellent quality
5 #### The chamois is very soft and comes in a plastic container that keeps the chamois from drying out between uses .
5 #### Great entry level binoculars . I bought these for my daughter to take on a nature - type field trip . Was tire of dealing with generic garbage binoculars . These are " real " binoculars , not the most powerful , but not too expensive I am overly worried they 'll get broken or lost . They are also very compact .
5 #### I 've used a number of FM transmitters over the years . This one produced the clearest sound of any of them even on stations that were not fully open . I like the fact that it hold the iPhone in place securely and also allows multiple axis of movement . Hooking it up to the iPhone port is easy . The arm of the FlexPod is very sturdy and keeps the phone in place . I 'm pleasantly surprised at how well this works .
4 #### Package of tapes were open , two in package 3rd one not .
5 #### worked great and even better then ones that came with Grill
4 #### These adapter Jacks MEET the Needs I Purchased them for . a GOOD BUY for the Price !
5 #### I was n't expecting anything from this headphone other that it being comfortable , which it is . But the bass , I did n't expect it to be present . I have very sensitive ears so I ca n't wear and listen to most headphones like the ATH - M50 because it gives me ear pressure that eventually becomes a headache and also most pads get very hot to the ears . This headphone is amazing . It obviously does n't have amazing soundstage but it will deliver , while being comfortable . I meant for this to be dispensable , but it seems like it might just last a long time . $ 6.99 ? Damn , I 'll buy another .
5 #### I purchased the Linksys router several months ago and I have never been more satisfied with a piece of electronic equipment . I had 3 PC 's in my home and I wanted them all to share the same Cable Modem access . The installation was a piece of cake and I was up and running in about 10 mins . I have two long CAT5 cable runs in my home , one is approx . 40 ft the other is approx . 25 ft the router runs them all no problem . I highly recommend this router to anyone looking to network multiple computers in their home or small business .
5 #### What 's not to like about well crafted saxophone reeds -- unless perhaps you do n't own a sax , leaving them little more than reedy bookmarks .
2 #### They are great . Totally sound isolating . Sound quality is n't the best , but we use them for our drummers at church and all of them love them . Edit : May 1st 2014 : not even 1 year later and one side went out . Now I got ta buy another pair and just hope they do n't go out again . No cable breakage and everything looks fine . Just bad build quality .
4 #### I stated in an earlier review that this keyboard had flawed software . This turned out to be incorrect ; the problem was a flawed keyboard ! I do n't know why a $ 50 keyboard " broke " since I 've never seen this happen w / any other keyboard ( nearly all of them cheap ) , but to Microsoft 's credit they sent me a new keyboard with little hassle after they troubleshot the problem out on the usenet . The keys are comfortable and pleasant to type .
1 #### Purchased 1 1/2 years ago for my truck . Both lenses cracked , seals broken , one filled with water , reflectors corroded . The shields to prevent direct light from the bulb going forward both broke off from vibration , scratching the reflectors .
5 #### The replacement trackball does exactly what it 's supposed to do ... ca n't beat the price . I ca n't imagine how much I would have been charged if I 'd taken my blackberry into a store to be fixed .
5 #### Great reed for beginning band teen adding oboe to his reed repertoire
3 #### bought it to replace old similar phone for bro who does n't want fancy smartphone . It 's a lot lighter and simple to use compared to newer phones .
2 #### Should remove rust as it states - and frankly i can not confirm that it did .
5 #### I have tried more than 12 different bluetooth headsets . The SBH-500 is the best ever . Outstanding call quality - never a complaint from the other party . Outstanding bass response , high frequency and stereo separation . It sometimes loses the bluetooth connection with my Iphone but I think the problem is the Iphone because it does that with most of the other headsets I tested . I will buy a second SBH-500 as a backup .
5 #### Clamps easily onto my music stand . I use this sidemount to hold the microphone which picks up my acoustic guitar . Works very well .
5 #### Great product at an exceptional price . I use Sea Foam on my 2007 Vw Passat with turbo and have had exceptional results period . My regiment is one can in the gas tank with fill up for clean injectors and the correct number of onces 1.5 / quarts of oil directly in the oil between 30 to 50 miles before you change your oil & filter . Do not add Sea Foam to you oil at operating temperature it sill evaporate and you get zero benefit . Add it to a cold engine and then drive between 30 to 50 miles and your engine will clean it self . Its a wonder product ! I used in an old John Deer lawn tractor and it was fantastic ! ! ! !
4 #### This folder is very nice , but the pockets could be bigger to accommodate larger sheet music . The pockets are not the full size of the folder .
5 #### Nice and compact , I use these to augment my view at performances at the Hollywood Bowl . They function well for the design limitations ( somewhat narrow field of view and not good for really low light situations ) . Excellent value for the amount paid .
5 #### Round Stainless ball . Warning , only use this with trailers with a 2 inch coupler firmly attached to the trailer . For sure be aware this ball must only be used with the proper shank which is firmly attached to your truck . Happy Towing
3 #### The bulbs have nice distance and color . I installed them in my Tundra a year ago . The bulbs made it exactly a year . Could have been a defective bulb , but still at this price you expect them to last a little longer .
4 #### The surge protector is a nice addition to my desk , but no color - coded stickers ( for the items plugged into the protector ) were in the package and I 'd really like to receive them . Now , although I can plug in 6 gadgets , I still do n't know which plug goes with which device . What 's the purpose of a color - coded socket if you ca n't use it ?
5 #### I generally use this with my sennheiser lav mic system when I film events . This works really well to swap the lav mic with and then with another XLR to 1/4 inch adaptor I can plug right into a board and get direct wireless audio . Great product !
5 #### I bought this license plate cover from my 2010 Honda Accord . I 'd install it on the rear license plate . It improves the looks of my car . I 've had it on for a couple of months . No rust or any blemishes thus far . Only time will tell how it stands up to the weather . Plate cover do not come with any mounting hardware .
5 #### They are easy to install and provide a wider view of your blind spots . I looked at others and found these to be the best value for the money . My wife had bought me a pair from QVC for our other car but I found them to be too small .
5 #### Great hubs - easy to install , and very durable . Easy to spin the selector as well .
2 #### you have to pinch the rubbery material to insert into ears and because it 's a rubbery material it 's not slippery so things stick to material . I prefer silicone and not something I have to squish to get into ear to stay in place . This is because I take out to listen to people trying to talk to me . If this was for running once a day I think it would work well .
5 #### I can not in of itself review this product because it was the wrong cell phone battery for my unit , what I can say , is that this company customer service is outstanding , if I could rate them it would be more than five stars
4 #### I just got the case . It has a nice feel to it and is very well constructed . I 'm happy with the purchase . This price is very good . Pros Heavy Duty Zipper . Well made . Great protection . Stylish Cons No belt clip . I do n't really miss it but it would be nice to free up my hands and stick it on my belt . ( but then again , I will look less like a geek . ) Makes Palm III more bulky . Difficult to keep in pocket . Not much room inside to store anything besides a business card and a couple of scraps of paper . Velcor mount for Palm III not very secure .
5 #### I have a collection of over 30 guitars . Of these , I play 4 - 5 of them all of the time , but I am happy ! ! ! One of my oft used axe is a cheapy that looks great as Wall Art in my living room . It has become the quicky - to - grab only because it is there . It sucks , but it works great in a pinch when I 'm too lazy to grab a non - cheap while I am couch - potatoing ! Not really to my surprise , the stock strings were just as crappy as the Axe , and my B string finally snapped on me as I did a quick tune . Ugh ! I could n't just leave it there hanging on my wall with a gaping blank in my fretboard , so I ordered a set of these strings . These are the same uber - impressive Elixir 's I have on my RainSong , and I thought I 'd take them for a ride on the cheapo . Wow ! They make the Wall Art sing ! I am impressed - do yourself a favor ; lace up these strings on your acoustic , and you will be impressed with how much better YOU sound !
1 #### Not satisfied the product did not work . The sound keeps cracking .
4 #### I wanted something to protect my cell phone screen from getting scratched . There 's so many different screen protectors to choose from and they all seem to do the same task . I do n't see how one can be better than the other , it 's just a thin plastic film . There were some really expensive protectors and some cheap ones too , so I went with the mid - priced one . They seem to be alright , I have n't had to replace it yet so I guess I 'm getting my money 's worth !
5 #### Exact fit , could n't have been easier to install and use .
3 #### Gave this as a gift to my grandfather , he loved the gift . I thought it was going to be a VT on a white background , it is not . The product is a VT on a silvery background . It looks like the VT part may just be a decal stuck on a plain metallic hitch , so we will see how long it lasts ...
4 #### as advertised , quick shipping , seems to be solid , bought this one because wife drowned her other phone , flashligh is a neat plus
5 #### I have never bought a K&N filter that was not the best of quality and this one was no different . Fits perfectly and I can feel the different in power and torque in my Excursion , this big 6.8L V-10 pulls my trailer even better than it did before . And the shipping was very fast .
5 #### GREAT STRINGS ...... I Use / Play an Old Martin D28 ... and these strings ... Are Bar NON The Only Ones ... for the Sounds ... An Old Martin " Kicks Out" ... Playing , Pickin BlueGrass Music ! ONLY Way T , Go!!!!!!aka ...... The Martin Way ..... or No Way ! after 50 yrs pickin ! LesH
4 #### Not a great phone bag but not too bad either . The material is soft and thick enough to add protection to your phone while in a bag , luggage or purse . Unlike some other reviewers I did receive the correct color ( dark blue ) . It barely fits my Samsung ATIV S which measures 130.2 x 70.5 x 8.7 . The cord on top does n't close all the way but it still hold the phone in securely . Recommended
1 #### < div id="video - block - R8US9MZY77V77 " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;This is some sample sound of the Audio - Technica 8HEx recorded onto my Zoom H4 at an audio store .

Sample is a high - quality .wav file.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Audio - Technica - Pro-8HEx - Headset - Microphone / dp / B0002H068M / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Audio Technica Pro 8HEx Headset Microphone</a >
5 #### This has pretty much become the industry standard . Great crisp sound , lightweight , durable , and feels comfortable in any size hands . The shape makes it much easier to play than traditional round tambourines .
5 #### If you like the colors , then this is a great choice for a hard case . The price was good and the case can take the wear of daily usage .
5 #### My internet provider told me I would need a router and if I just used a switch to try to connect both computer and DVD player to the modem my internet would slow to a crawl or not work . I have only the cheapest DSL connection . I thought I would just try this and see what happens . I plugged my DSL modem into the Netgear switch and then plugged my new DVD player into the switch and turned everything on . I chose the Netflix option on the player and it connected , got my code , entered into the Netflix website , and I was instantly streaming my movie . My internet speed has not suffered at all . I would not be using the internet and watching a movie at the same time , but I tried using the internet while the movie was on just to see . No loss of speed . This little switch was the solution I needed .
1 #### Damaged goods . The box was okay but they did n't put the bolts into a secure bag so they came rolling around in the box . We thought the item was okay until we installed it today ( got the product on Saturday ) and found several scratched on the vent from the loose bolts . This is not okay . We throw away the box , so we ca n't return it . We are left with a damaged vent shade . Not happy .
5 #### I 've used this on three guitars now and it does a great job . One of the guitars was old and had n't been cleaned or oiled in quite a while so it did a dramatically good job on it . My only knock would be that the oil bottle has a tricky sponge / cloth top that takes a bit of extra effort . No biggy though .
1 #### Received this product yesterday . It is completely unusable , as the LG Voyager fits so tightly into the case , that it 's nearly impossible to remove the phone once inserted . There were also no belt loops as depicted in the photo , just the belt clip and some weird plastic snap thing that would n't really prevent the phone from slipping off the belt clip . The case barely closed , and the magnetic snap would obviously pop open every few minutes . ( But not to worry , the phone wo n't get lost , because it takes two hands and two minutes to remove the phone from the case . ) It 's also not leather , and has a very strong vinyl / plastic odor . Even though it 's inexpensive , it was a complete waste of time and money . It went right into the junk drawer , and will ultimately enter the trash unused .
5 #### The Club 1000 Original Club Steering Wheel Lock is used on my automobile that is parked out on the street at night . I use wherever I park . Remember this . It is a jungle out there and is worth using this to protect your investment .
5 #### If u want to type comfortably , for not to much money , this is am awesome phone
4 #### Save the money and buy this USB . Saves you money compare to the Apple brand one that cost a fortune .
5 #### Jut my preefered sound . Great tones , durable and very reliable . Simply packaged , you just need to open the plastic and put this on the guitar , nothing more . What camn i say about the strings ? This have a very well known quality from D'Addario , as if you doenst know that already . :-)
5 #### Does what it says , really durable . The sound is really poor when you first wind it , but after some hours / days playing it gets good .
5 #### I received this product as a x - max gift . It took about and hour or two to get used to the split keyboard , but it was smooth sailing after that . The only problem that I had ( which was resolved a few hours after use ) , was the quieter key action when typing . It does not take much pressure to type on the keyboard , which is a bit of change for me . This was however , resolved a few hours after use . I find that my hands and fingers get fatigued less often than with my previous keyboard , just a standard flat keyboard . I 've also noticed that my typing speed has increased , being that it is more comfortable to type . What I really like about the keyboard is the shortcut keys , a must - have feature for any keyboard . I do not use many USB devices , but when I do , it is very handy to have 2 ports right at the keyboard . The Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro is an excellent product , after the short ' learning curve ' , it allowed me to type faster , and more comfortably than ever before . I would recommend this to anyone who expirences any type of fatigue when using a traditional flat - style kayboard , or would rather type more naturally ( hence the name ;) .
3 #### the signal is not at 4 watts like it states and unless u run a very long antenna the range is very limited
5 #### I had tried several " leather " cleaning products on my livingroom sofa , none of them worked very well . I remembered having used Lexol on my saddles and figured I 'd give it a try . The Lexol worked great and I followed it up with the Lexol conditioner which also worked very well .
5 #### I have not used any of the tapes as of yet . I 'm sure they will be okay . I have used this brand before .
2 #### I am a bit disappointed , especially for an American Made product . After installing these strings , they all sound " flat " like old strings do when they start going bad . I guess it 's back to Martin Strings for me , these are awful .
4 #### 4 stars because while they are great sticks , I ca n't say I notice any difference between these and my normal 5BNs . It was n't that much more money to try them out , and maybe for some people they work really well . For me , however , I 'll ' stick ' with my regular 5BN !
2 #### Not very good . Seems like it 's impossible to get a single image from these . We 're having to use a single eye at a time !
4 #### I bought the cheapest one , I use it mainly to close over RV door while traveling . Easy install , other than the fact my cheap Jayco does not have a stud in the wall at the door location and I had to bolt all the way through . I bought Allen head bolts and washers so I could bolt through wall and tighten bolts . RV quality no fault of this product . Inexpensive solution to my dilemma .
3 #### Way too expensive for what you get . Plus the letters easily fade or are rubbed off . But once you buy into this Brother labeling system you 're pretty much stuck .
1 #### This thing did not work at all . Do n't waste your money . It was a cheap piece of crap . Buy somewhere else .
3 #### Flimsy and I did n't understand the instructions . I ended up getting one locally .
5 #### Great buy , fast shipping , easy install , works great . I sold the automatic hubs off the truck and bought these for what I sold the autos for . Very happy .
4 #### Dynamat is used for sound dampening and thermal resistance . I used it to quiet a downdraft vent in our kitchen by applying it to the outer metal housing under the range . This stopped the thin metal parts from vibrating when the fan was turned up . It worked well for that use case . I 'm also going to use it to replace the sound dampening material that came off the bottom of our stainless sink in the kitchen . Without the sound dampening material , even the smallest bump with anything hard and the sink makes a loud noise . I expect Dynamat to work just as well as the previous material ( no loud noise ... ) and hopefully it will last longer and not fall off .
5 #### Make sure you push these deep into your ears . If they are only lightly in the bass is missing . But push them in deep , ( not unreasonably deep or painfull , just all the way ) and these sound great . The highs are clear , the bass is clean and not over emphasized , and the mids are balanced . It sounds great . Night and day against several otehr low and mid priced earbuds I have used . I have n't used the ear foam pieces , so I do n't know how well they stay on . But I give these five stars for the sound , and I would even if they cost more . If you want ear buds , these sound amazing .
5 #### I love this Bluetooth . I have had a lot of Bluetooth , by far it is the best . It had the best sound , clarity and range of any on the market . I hope that Amazon keeps caring them
4 #### For 6 and 12 string acoustic guitars this capo is A1 . If you put it past the nut then tune the guitar in that position you will have no problems rolling it up the neck without tuning problems . Of course , if you have a cheap guitar with poor intonation the tuning will go out but that 's not down to the capo . This capo WILL work with electric and classical guitars . The capo is wide enough even for these guitars . However , this is where the problems come and why I have given the capo 4 stars . As this capo has a fixed tension it bends the thinner strings of a standard electric guitar and a nylon strung classical guitar causing multiple tuning problems . This could probably be mitigated by overstretching the springs so that the tension was n't as hard . It could also be solved by the manufacturer putting some kind of spring tension adjustment screw somewhere .
5 #### Once you see water beading up and flowing off your windshield during heavy rain , you 'll be hooked . Definitely worthwhile . I have used this product pretty regularly for over 20 years , and will continue to do so until self - driving cars remove my need to see outside the vehicle . Some things I have n't seen mentioned in other reviews ... 1 ) After application , I have seen ( in what during daylight appears to be a perfectly clean windshield ) " flares " around light sources at night . This can be annoying in bright night environments - like tunnels , etc . 2 ) Windshield washing can be an adventure depending upon the spray pattern of your car 's nozzles . If you get a nice even mist , it 'll probably be fine . Older cars that squirt a stream - good luck ! Note : RainX does little to help shed dust , pollen , etc . 3 ) Maybe it 's just my imagination , but wiper blade inserts do n't seem to last as long when used on coated windshields .
3 #### Ca n't get my phone ( Samsung Galaxy Centura ) to recognize it . So have n't been able to use it yet .
4 #### This is a pretty good pickup -- with a problem . The sound , when installed on several of my guitars , is quite mellow and sounds a lot like the guitars themselves only louder -- all except the B string . With both phosphor bronze and 80/20 light strings , on the three acoustics I tested it with , the piercing volume and tone of the B string makes the pickup unusable for flat picking and less - than - perfect for finger style . I could work with it for finger style , but I 'd have to take the B string off the guitar to use this pickup for flat picking or strumming . It 's that unbalanced ( for my style , guitar , and string combination ) . I love how it installs and how it virtually disappears when installed . The price is n't bad . The pickup is dead quiet , with respect to hum or other noise . Overall , I 'd buy a couple if there was a way to tame the B string . By the way I found that a Seymour Duncan Woody Humbucker with adjustable pole pieces worked out better for me at a third less cost , but I do prefer the way the Fishman Neo - D installs . If you like the way it sounds , this could be a great pickup to semi - permanently install in your acoustic .
5 #### Works great . I like that it comes with ears for mounting on server rack rails . The indicator lights are nice . Does exactly what it needs to do with no fuss .
4 #### The screen covers are slightly larger so they tend to peel off easily or get air bubbles , but otherwise not bad for the price .
5 #### The Motorcraft filter has more filter element than the ones from the auto store . It fits better in my ford and just looks like it belongs there . Do n't skimp on this first defense of your motor .
3 #### These work pretty good . I live out in the country where there are hardly any towers and they are about 5 to 10 miles away with alot of terrain . I am able to use my phone in most places . Would still recommend because if you still ca n't talk you still get enought signal to text . :)
3 #### This is a great BT headset with one BIG exception : it has a proprietary USB cable . Why do we have USB standards when many BT vendors make their own . This device would be perfect if it supported mini - USB on the headset side .
5 #### Easy to install , reasonably priced , and perfect fit . Have even had friends and family comment that it makes my Expedition look even more sporty ... going to be investing in the one for the moonroof next .
3 #### Very cute case . 1 little problem . The plastic around the earphone Jack is thin that it breaks apart on it 's own . Caseology was kind enough to replace it . The case did the same thing with the replacement .
4 #### The carrying case fits well , and the window is clear enough to allow easy viewing of the screen . The clip is very stout , allowing the unit to be carried on a belt or strap . My only complaint , and it is a very minor one , would be the way the case seals with the Velcro . I think it would be better to have the top fold over the back , not under , as it is designed currently .
5 #### Amazing construction , heavy metal zippers and clasps and thick material makes me feel safe keeping my new DSLR in it . Shoulder strap is nice , could probably fit my amateur body and 2 med - small lenses in it , say the kit lens and a 50 mm with ease , could probably squeeze in another if I kept one on the camera . Pretty good price for something so well - made , would buy again .
5 #### I broke the strap on our RV awning about a year ago and tied it to a rope as a temporary ' fix ' . Spotted this on Amazon and it works perfectly . I highly recommend it .
4 #### nice item . price is good . could n't have asked for anything more . i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything .
5 #### I got one of these in 2007 when converting my 1984 Toyota 4Runner from carb to fuel injection . It 's a rock crawler that does double duty whenever there 's something fun to drive over / in / through or when other vehicles need to be pushed / pulled / dragged . Which is to say the truck gets abused heavily and I mostly do n't think about the fuel pump . It 's been submerged repeatedly into mud & gunky water and continued running without hesitation . All the way up until 2012 when it sat completely unused for almost a year . When I tried to start it up in 2013 it would n't run anymore , so I replaced it with another MSD just like it . As it turned out , the pump did n't fail ... the nasty ethanol in the fuel lines made a gluey varnish through my entire fuel system and stuck that pump tight . Not the pump 's fault . Had to replace everything including the injectors before it 'd run again . Note to self : always use Seafoam in the tank . Anyway , this pump has been perfect for me for 8 years now . The only down side : it 's not silent . Mine is hard mounted on the frame and you can hear it very well even with the engine running . Admittedly , I have no doors , windows , insulation or floor mats in the vehicle but most of the buzz seems to come through the frame anyway . I 'd not recommend it for a daily driver vehicle , but only because of that noise . Maybe if it were rubber - mounted it 'd be okay .
5 #### Installation was easy . Placing the antenna on top then pull the cable down to the booster , then connect the cig lighter adapter and the vent unit with magnet . Very nicely designed and executed ! The vent kit with magnet is very sturdy . The signal boosted shows significant improvement . The white LED light in the top left holder unit shows signal strength and stability . If it 's blinking it means it 's trying to find the best signal . The booster works without you knowing it 's working . I 've used it for a few days now and it shows significant improvement with clarity . It 's worth the money if you travel frequently and needs to be on the phone while driving . Much less drop calls .
5 #### The 35 mm film is getting harder and harder to find , almost as much as finding places to develop it . But , when you need film , REAL film at 25 Mega Pixel . In which you can take to a image processor and blow up to house size , nothing beats good 35 mm film . Okay , a 4x6 studio camera , but who has these at home , in your car or in a bag for those wonderful candid shots ? Not me ! I ordered a pack of 200 , 400 and 800 film for that simple reason , it 's getting rare ! Ca n't say a lot about Fuji Film , simply , it 's good .
1 #### Although it did seem to power up the wheel , it was not recognized at all by XP ( I understand this , as the wheel is not plug and play ) but the installation of many different drivers and software did not help . Threw it and the wheel away . Getting a new USB wheel for xmas , I hope .
5 #### I purchased the V6s to use DJing . They definitely are worth every penny ( I snagged them for $ 70 ) . The low end is solid and the set beats my grado SR60s for EDM , House , etc . The construction is also very solid with the cord reinforced at both the plug and left earpiece . Sound isolation from the pads seems to relatively effective but I have n't had the chance to use them in a loud environment or with a separate speaker set yet . The packaging included a bag to help protect the headphones which was a nice addition though I may try and find a container for extra security ( I 'm notoriously rough on my portable audio equipment ) . I plan to do a side by side review of SR60s vs. the V6s in the near future but my guess is that outside of bass driven genres the SR60s will provide a bit better listening experience . By the way , these headphones are extremely comfortable and despite my fat head I have n't noticed any discomfort due to tightness .
5 #### For me ( amateur Mr. Fixit ) this repair is much harder than older iPhones . This is the correct part . Came with the correct sticky bits and ok tools . There are a lot more screws of different size . I would suggest getting at least one of the part placement magnetic maps . The screen looked good . Glass seemed a bit thicker than the original but not enough to be certain . Be careful it is easy to tear the flexible connection strips , do n't pull them through , push .
1 #### I purchased these 8x21s so that I could have a small and lightweight pair of binoculars to take on outdoor outings with my wife . I own a pair of old Bushnell Instavision 8x21 bincoulars that are excellent for me , but due to my wife 's nearsightedness do not work for her . I was hoping that these would be as good as my other Bushnell binoculars and work for both me and my wife , but I was really disappointed . The field of view does not seem to be as wide a claimed , and the mis - alignment between the two sides was such that the left and right images would not merge when I viewed though them . The effect was rather like trying to look through a pair of tubes . There were also a lot of bad internal reflections . All in all , I found these to be totally unusable . It really is a dispappointment about the poor optics , because that size , weight , and general form factors was othewise excellent .
5 #### besides being a little bulky , after flashing the firmware . downloading the new software . these mp3 / mini drives are great . have used rio and they broke after a year . sound is the best . and best of all no memory card . reads mps and wma files , excellent
5 #### I 've lost the eyecup included in the original kit . This replacement from Canon fits perfectly and is exactly the same as the one I originally had .
5 #### if you loose your picks frequently like me , you need to get this packet right now , these are my favorite tortex picks
5 #### Just what my son & his band teacher wanted . Sturdy & he plays very well with them . Last long .
1 #### I wear this on the belt loop and the loop for the belt just got torned and ripped in just 2 - months . Not worth the money .
3 #### This works , and I really like Evans . But I got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap . Although I have been using it for awhile now with hard use and it is holding up great and saving my kick drum head from abuse .
1 #### I 've tried dozens of different screen protectors on dozens of different devices . Most have worked well and I rarely have had to replace one due to scratching . Getting the protector on without bubbles or trapped debris is usually the major problem . While the Luxmo was n't the most difficult to install , I still managed to ruin the back protector with lint . However , that is a minor issue . The front was flawless - for about 2 days before I noticed a fairly deep scratch . Within a few more days the front was covered with scratches and mars . I imagine the plastic is very soft as the phone is kept in a pocket by itself or rarely with a few bills . there was no contact with any hard objects . I will be looking for a replacement as soon as more come out . For now , I would not recommend this product .
5 #### I know I used to use 2 mouses and Keyboards sharing 1 Monitor . If you are one of the serious " Joes " who has more than 1 Computer system , and has one of those old switch boxes for your keyboard , mouse , and monitor . Check this item out for grabs . The " Linksys ProConnect 2 - Port Compact KVM Switch Kit " , a 2 port sharing interface with cables included . Yup , I sure did say " cables included " . The truth to make things much simpler , it has support for your PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard , which means you do n't lose power and control between switch overs . And do n't need to reach over to the switch to make it work , that 's right ! It has a hot key function , " LCtrl " x2 . That 's it ! You can even put the box hidden or on top of 1 the Systems . Who cares ! You 'll never see it again once you 've installed it . Pretty Cool huh ! This product package with " Ingenius " written all over it is a STEAL !
4 #### Item delivered within the time it was scheduled to arrive . Item was as described and has being used without any problems so far . Thank you !
5 #### Good cable . I have a fender cable that 's supposedly " noiseless " that hums , and this one does n't make any noise .
5 #### I owned the non HD version , and was impressed . These are even better , I 'm very happy with these wireless speakers . they are great for working out , and the fitment is great . My friends that have had a chance to check mine out have decided to purchase them aswell . Another plus is not having to carry my phone and an MP3 player , all I need to have is my phone which is on me all the time anyways . I do not reccomend purchasing them unless they are brand new in the original packaging , due to a bad experience , I had from one seller . ( [ ... ] )
5 #### Popular Photography recently called this camera " ... possibly the best camera in the universe and I agree . It is small , light , it has an * excellent * quality lens . The lens quality is way above the average point and shoot . The lack of zoom is one of the reasons the lens can be * so * good . Maximum lens opening of f2.8 and maximum shutter speed of 1/1000 sec ( but no ' manual ' setting ) It has an ' intellegent ' flash that reduces flash intensity for close - up shots ( prevents overexposure ! ) Many different available ' modes ' give you great versatlity , including ' red eye ' flash mode and a ' spot ' metering option . I own 4 of these cameras !
5 #### This style of capo CAN throw your guitar out of tune if you do n't put it on right . When used correctly though , it does it 's job just fine .
4 #### If you have this thing in a closet somewhere , and do n't care about the lights on the front , then this is ok , but I have it on my desk , and like to see what machines are heavily using traffic , and what machines are not . It works very well for traffic , but the L.E.D. 's do NOT blink rapidly with traffic flow . They will only blink at a steady rate . You can not tell if the traffic flow through each connection is light or heavy because of this , and because of this , you ca n't determine what machines are talking to each other .
5 #### offers a whole new level of ear thumping purgatory every time my son plays , which is almost every evening . at least the sound is pure and vibrant compared to his old set of heads . i highly recommend this item for anyone looking for one of the best drum heads and at an affordable price .
5 #### Amazon is great because of items like this . For years I have been using a standard grease gun on my tractor and never really get a good and clean job done . But that was all I knew . Then I looked at this model . It is a 5 star product . It is made in India and works great . Great buy
5 #### I was glad to see that the cord worked on my radar as I hoped it would . I will try no t to kink the cord to prevent damaging it as I did the original .
5 #### excellent seller excellent item better than listed very satisfied Thank You
5 #### To me these are the best sounding strings around . For those who want a more traditional sound you need to use nickle strings there are quite a few out there and I tried a lot of them . Before I was using DR Pure blues which were fine but these are just that little bit better they take it up to 11 .
5 #### Does exactly what I need it to do ... make phone calls ! I do n't want a keyboard , I do n't text , I do n't want to surf the ' net on my phone ... I do all of that with the 6 computers I have at home & work . I like the decent - size number pad ... very adequate volume and it looks great .
4 #### Put it in my 2001 Mustang Cobra . Have not noticed much of a difference yet . I have filled the tank twice now since adding the product . It was already running fine . The only problem with my engine is too much timing , so it pings more than I would like . I already added a K&N filter . It may be time for a custom tune or some aviation fuel .
5 #### A little long but not a problem . Sliced a bit off the bottom because they were a tad long . I put these on my 86 f-250 4x4 They look good & feel heavy duty .
5 #### I have used Maxell Cassettes for over 30 years and never have been disappointed . If you ar an audio purist , do n't purchase this , go for the higher bias . For normal folk like me with tin - pan ears , this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price , whether that price is retail or sale .
1 #### The instructions say to connect the can to the supplied hose , turn the can upside down and allow contents to empty into the car 's AC system . Well the can " emptied " alright , but only into the attached hose , not fully into the car 's AC system . So when I detached the hose from the car ( because the can was " empty " ) , you guessed it , this EXPENSIVE sealant went rushing out of the hose and onto my garage floor . Not happy .
5 #### Hohner harps are the best for the money . Not the best made , but OK for my purposes .
5 #### Great strings . I love their electric strings , so I tried these . The Martins did not come in 11s and these do . I will continue to buy these . I am very happy with them .
3 #### It 's marked as CAT5e , but my network speeds were downgraded . I had to give up on it and use something else .
1 #### I tried two of these with the same 3 - pole ( stereo audio , mic , control ) headset in the same iPhone , and in both cases , one of the audio channels would either play static or nothing at all . When I plugged the headset directly into the iPhone , all was well . Buyer beware .
5 #### Very nice drum sticks . The tone is very good . They 're not to heavy . And they 're very affordable . Durable , but again , I do n't play that hard .
5 #### The only thing with the label " California " that is worth buying .
5 #### Cheap but looks good and fits snugly on my belt . Overall satisfied , good construction and smooth finish . Removing the phone is easily done by pushing up on it through middle bottom slot .
5 #### We love this unit , easy to use , good reception . We use it for offroading to keep in touch with the other drivers . We use it in our vehicle also , not sure of distance but works fine .
1 #### Does not fit a standard radio in the opening . Does not fit the mounting on a 2000 Dodge Neon
5 #### I have had this bluetooth for years now and it is the best bluetooth i have used . Occasionally i try another one but always come back to this one for it 's comfort , sound , and quality . I have left the house before with it still on my head simply because I forget it is there after a few minutes . I did alot of research before buying three of these . Plantronics also did audio equipment for NASA . All three of the ones I bought have been awesome . No complaints at all .
4 #### This is my 4th set of these . They came when they were expected , installed easily and work great The only con .......... the passenger side front shield came with a small crack in it . You do n't notice it , on the car .
4 #### It is a real tight fit . The main problem is the the cut out for the rear view mirror is too small and you have to bend the shade to get it around it . It kinks and is the weak point in longevity .
5 #### Purchased six of these for use in our store . They are durable , with an 8 foot grounded cord . Amazon 's 2005 product description indicates 1260 joules protection - 2010 model has 520 joules @ 330 clamping volts . Will certainly purchase Kensington surges again .
3 #### Ordered one from the Warehouse Deals and I got a soft polyfoam case instead I sent it back , but I really like the images . I may buy another .
5 #### Great replacement for my torn boat straps ! Ca n't go wrong
5 #### I know these are the most expensive strings , which is a turn off , but every penny you put into these strings are worth it .
5 #### What is there to say - it works like advertised and makes running fuel lines super easy and very affordable . No complaints here . OEM quality for sure . No leaks on my entire system first time .
5 #### This item was exactly what I hopped it would be - it was exactly what I was looking for in my order .
5 #### Got these for my daughter and husband who always have a dead battery . It worked great straight out of the box .
4 #### Good quality . Good price . Fit my 2008 Econoline just fine .
4 #### Good for price . The material is not very Hard if you are looking for serious weight lifting or something like that . There are cheaper brands that deliver thicker and durable materials .
5 #### Excelente producto recomendado .. lo recomiendo ! funciona excelente y llego a tiempo , excelente envoltura y tal cual lo describio el vendedor
5 #### I like these because it has a wound G. Plays quite well for my style ( 60/70 Rock and Roll and Surf , contemporary Christian Praise ) . If you clean them before and after every session with Fast Fret , they will last a very long time and stay quite bright .
5 #### Works nicely on my iphone . Will continue to buy these as long as they keep selling them and I have my iphone .
2 #### The whole package of picks was bent . All picks curve the same way . You can really notice how much they are bent if you put 2 of these picks together non - graphic side . I never paid attention to it until now . Fender thin picks in Red are completely flat . As a result , if you flip these picks , the feel changes completely . I guess it 's not as bad for simple strumming , but when playing intricate solos , one side of the pick feels completely different from the other side .
5 #### This Netgear Ethernet 5 - port switch makes plug and play easy for novices . Great product design and compactness does n't require much space .
5 #### I originally bought these to replace the stock reverse bulbs in my 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS . They are certainly much brighter than the stock bulbs . How bright are they ? Not only do they let people behind me know that I 'm backing up , but they are actually bright enough to illuminate the area behind me , enough to where I can clearly see what is behind me at night . I bought these bulbs from Auto Barn back in March of 2008 ( the 2008 Lancer came out in 2007 , so no time traveling was necessary ) and even with daily usage , they have not failed . Oddly enough , even after 4 years , the price is exactly the same . What 's even more intriguing is that nobody else left reviews in that same time frame . Underrated bulbs , to say the least . I would guess that more people are switching over to LED lights , but the only way you can match the brightness of a filament bulb with an LED is if you are spending $ 20 per LED light ( $ 40 for a pair ) . $ 20 shipped from Auto Barn , super bright , long lasting ... what more could I ask for ?
5 #### One drop already , so this item has paid for itself already . Great protection ... little difficult getting in and out of the holster ... but that can be a good thing .
5 #### I bought this unit when I needed another Ethernet port , but my 8 - port D - Link was full . As soon as I replaced it with the Netgear switch , my network performance improved dramatically . Even the equipment that connects wirelessly to my router ( bypassing the switch ) got faster . I believe that the Netgear firmware is much more efficient and than my old switch and frees up my router for other tasks .
5 #### Fits my 2015 Triumph Bonneville . The hooks slip over the grab rail on each side . The hooks are plastic and may not hurt the paint .
5 #### worked flawlessly better than those $ 10 - 20 ones was surprised great product .
5 #### Just what I needed delivered to my doorstep in two days with Amazon Prime . What 's not to love ?
5 #### I got this for a friend of mine who could n't find a replacement phone battery anywhere . It was shipped quickly and just what she needed . Thanks Amazon .
1 #### I thought I liked this phone until I used the alarm and found out it messes up the software . After the alarm triggers the screen will not go out until you turn off the phone or take out the battery . The phone is light and cheap feeling so I am not going to complain about the price . I like clam shell phones but this LG is hard to open . Sometimes I need a butter knife to prey open the phone because the edges are too smooth . I could sent the phone back to LG to fix the software issue but they do n't have a remedy and I do not want a refurbish phone . I came from the Motorola W370 phone which I have enjoyed but it was getting outdated . The LG does not have as great of signal strength as the Moto and it very hard to open when getting a call . I can not open the LG like the Moto with one hand . The LG battery life is much better but if you use the alarm , the screen will drain the phone in a day . If you are planing to get this phone , you should wait . The software is buggy and the design of the phone is not functional . I always fumble trying to get it open and I have dropped it often because it gets oily and slippery .
5 #### This is excellent pinstriping tape and I would recommend it to anyone needing pinstriping tape . I have had no problems with application .
5 #### Been using Kyser Capos for years . Bought this for my niece to match her pink guitar and she loved it .
5 #### great and will be getting another one soon , I love this cup holder it hold my phone very sturdy and everybody need to own one thank you Amazon
5 #### I think it 's great ! What a fabulous price . Very adjustable . Holds my iphone with a heavy crystal , thick case very firmly . Does n't get in my way . Can just tap and talk even if I 'm driving . No problems . Do n't even have to look at it . Very easy to take out and put phone in . Mechanism glides smooth . Would n't buy any other one . If and when it goes , will just buy another one . Fast shipping too ! Why look elsewhere ? Especially for $ 8 bucks !
5 #### Works for the Blackberry Storm and any other device that uses a micro USB port .
5 #### Great strings , totally helped out , easy to play , made my cello sound so much better , are loud project sound a lot , so be careful and know your cello so u know what sound is going to be produced
5 #### I suspect it is nothing more than some kind of modified tar , but it works wonders . The sound deading properties are what it is best at . I suppose the foil back provides some resistance to heat transfer , but that is not it , s main purpose . I also love the fact that it sticks in place without a lot of fuss . I bought the roller to help with the application , but it is not a necessity . I goes on with your hands just fine . All my cars have this product installed . Good stuff ! ! !
5 #### Hard to find an earpiece that sits over , rather than in the ear canal . This could be especially important for those with hearing aids , tight ear canals etc . The fidelity is excellent , the coupling simple and the running time exceptional
5 #### btfll case give my phone btfll touch and protection.thank you ...
5 #### Much better than the non - smart phones offered by AT&T. The frequency response gives clear voice with both the microphone and speaker . The menus and address book are clear and easy to use . The Bluetooth works reliably in our cars . The case is sturdy and convenient . The main drawback is that the battery usually needs to be charged every 2 - 3 days . The camera is limited in light level and does not capture very accurate color . This is our 4th RAZR , I still am using my original phone with a replacement battery . Another benefit is that we do n't have to sign up for a 2 year commitment with our carrier .
5 #### Not really much to review . This is a pretty simple item . The price was good and it does what it is supposed to do .
5 #### This is a wonderful invention , allowing one to buzz while holding the trumpet and playing along with the fingering , though of course , mistaken fingerings do not affect the pitch of the buzzing . My son is the trumpeter . I am using the french horn version of the BERP as I have decided to learn french horn after playing trombone for many years . I find that after buzzing through an exercise using the BERP , my sound on the french horn gets bigger . I guess that the BERP requires one to use a lot of air . Adolph Herseth said that he practiced buzzing on the mouthpiece daily for about an hour of his daily practice time . So if buzzing worked for him , it is probably a good idea for my son . Also , Maynard Ferguson reportedly buzzed frequently in hotel rooms prior to evening performances .
5 #### I 've used two of these on my acoustics for about five years now . Others have written about if this can be trusted to hold a guitar . That is just silly . Of course it could . I demonstrated this to a friend by wrapping this on a ceiling pipe in a garage and swinging from it . Holds 200 lbs easy . Have n't had a problem with them scratching the guitar head . I do let the guitar rest off the guitar strap where some will hold the guitar so the trap is taunt . That might make a difference . Length has been no problem either . If it was too long I would just have it wrap an extra time . This does allow straps that were slightly too short for me to fit effortlessly . The quick release is nice because I can get the strap out of the way as I 'm putting it into the case . Some of my straps have metal parts that would dig into the guitar if it was just laying there . If there ONE thing I would do to change this is to give options other than black . White or red would be better .
4 #### I bought this bcos it was cheap . The fastener is difficult to unclip due to its tiny size . I have small hands . I like it better if the strings are shorter , so it wo n't dangle . So far it serves me well
4 #### Works very well for what I wanted it for . Holds folders like it is suppose to do and can put them either way .
5 #### Good price replacement for an old tank of a UPS I 've had for many years . Charged fine and good as new again .
4 #### It would not be fair to say anything negative , because it does do the job it was designed for . However , it was somewhat thinner than I was expecting . The reason for docking a star was because it did not have an accessory or extension for attaching the strap to a guitar at the top of the neck , rather than to a stud at the neck end of the body . To explain , some guitars do not have a stud at the top end of the body , where it meets the neck , so you have to attach the strap at the top end of the neck , just below the machine heads . There is not normally a stud for this , so you need to string it with a bootlace or , better , with a purpose - designed accessory .
4 #### It 's a cable , what does one say about a product like this . I wanted one and I now have it
5 #### Replacing an older version that stopped working and it works very nicely and just as good as the old talk box .
4 #### I just ordered this case over the weekend , and it arrived on Tuesday ! It is definitely not top of the line , but for only a couple of dollars I think it is a great deal , and it fits on my iPhone very well . I especially like that the bottom opening is large enough that I can plug the phone into my car 's iPod jack without having to remove the cover like I do with most of the rubberized cases . Thanks !
3 #### I got this product and i was all excited about getting it . The convenience of being a distance away from the computer and being able to use the mouse was great . After a few months it began to drain the batteries very quickly within 2 days . I tried changing batteries- rechargeable and alkaline- both with same disappointing results . Unfortunately i had to dispose of it . Got a corded one instead and it works like a charm .
5 #### Works great in the pickup , and I have also used it to secure doors in the house ! ! !
5 #### Product and service was as described . Still using with decent results
5 #### This cable has two ends , each of which must be put into a particular receptacle that will receive it in order to function . Indeed , it has those two ends which function as required .
5 #### I was looking for an alternative guitar pick that would produce a mellower tone . This was n't exactly what I wanted . But it did produce an intriguing tone that I liked as an alternative for certain songs so it added an additional layer to my repertoire that made me happy .
5 #### Works well but did not do what I expected so I returned it . Now I am wishing that I had it back . Distance was like 1 - 2 miles on rubber - duck and several miles with my car antenna , about what I get with my Cobra 148 GTL . If it had SSB I would buy several of them . Anyway , it is worth the money just do n't expect to get super far with the rubber - duck .
4 #### It made things a lot easier with the right plug
5 #### I bought two of these and use one at home as my regular charging base and take one with me " on the road " so I can use my BlackBerry as my bedside clock and alarm clock .
3 #### I guess I thought this would have autofocus but it 's manual . Kinda disappointed in that feature . Other than that , its a great lens .
5 #### I go through headphones like water . With no strain relief , premature failure usually occurs between the cord and plug . These are my first Panasonics and they are comparable to ones from Maxell and Koss for about the same price . Fairly comfortable and excellent sound . Amazing technology for five dollars . By the way , the plug is offset 90 degrees - in case that is important to you .
4 #### My problem with most cases is they make a small phone turn into a big one -- not the case here . This case keeps the nexus at a small size ( of course it gets a little bigger ) . It has a very good feel to it , too . I have read some reviews of gaps in the corner / edges -- while this is true , it is not as pronounced of a gap(s ) as you may suspect . Overall , it 's a really sleek case and I 'm really glad I got it !
4 #### Exactly as stated . This is a good Holster Carrying Case at 1/5 the price you would pay at the mall . Iphone with rubber case fits in pouch .
4 #### Very durable , fine looking and very useful drum sticks for the drum players out there . The quality is great and the size shape and weight are all just fine . This is not a bad deal at all .
5 #### Perfect match for use with Connor Towing 1625200- Adjustable 2 " Ball Mount . Keeping this coated with WD40 so it does not corrode . Working great !
3 #### I love these Xtreme White bulbs . I 've tried around a dozen different brands / types of street legal bulbs and these are by far the brightest / best light . I 've used the PIAA bulbs for over 5 years - the only reason that I did n't give these a 5 star rating is that they only seem to last 6 - 12 months and are quite expensive to keep replacing . I 've had them in 5 different cars with the same issue ( confirming the bulbs burning out is not because of the car ) " Toyota Matrix , Ford Focus , Hyundai Veracruz & Santa Fe , and Nissan Pathfinder . Again , loved the brightness in all of these vehicles but had the same short bulb life issues .
5 #### good case to protect your iphone had a lot of cases before this is the best i ever got you should try it
4 #### This device will allow you to use any headphones with the iPod . It does add size and weight to the iPod .
5 #### The Elixir brand acoustic guitar strings keep their brand - new ' sound ' a lot longer than any other brand . I am very happy with the Elixir brand strings .
5 #### I 've played this brand of reeds for years and years ... love how each one is individually protected in a plastic gadget that should help it survive transport in a pocket , just in case the one under the mouthpiece cap gets dinged up or splits . Gives me the edgy sound I prefer .
2 #### Bought these wipers during winter last year . New England had a pretty bad winter , but I did n't get a lot of snow testing out of them . However , 6 months in they were already streaking . I have not tried contacting silblade yet but may very well have to as this winter looks like it will end up just the same . Having a jeep wrangler , there 's not much out there for options with wiper blades . May just go back to get oem blades from a dealer again .
5 #### this was a great addition to the boat especially if you have those electronics that you charge . Easy to install .
5 #### This item certainly has received mixed reviews . I for one , however , am glad I decided to purchase this cable and would do so again in a heartbeat . It is sturdy , well - constructed , the end plugs work well and are not too tight / snug , and a great value . LOVE having the 7 ' cable - less distortion . Has the Belkin lifetime warranty . I do n't see what the problem is ... Recommend ! !
4 #### I got these a few weeks ago from a half day sale on newegg for half the price they are going for here now . I was really close to sending them back because i could n't get them to pair with anything . apparently when you turn it on after fully charging for the first time you need to turn it off , then hold the power button aka the giant piece on the right side that says bluetooth , for over 5 seconds , then the blue bluetooth light will stay on and it will be in discovery mode . this was really frustrating to find out as i could not find this in the manual which i read over 2 or 3 times and tried to follow everything step by step . anyways so far so good with these , not great but not bad .
3 #### Very happy with this Adco tire cover perfectly covered the spare tire which makes the camper look more attractive now
5 #### I bought this to clean a Gale Banks air filter because I could n't find a Banks cleaning kit . It is also an excellent all purpose cleaner .
5 #### I use a music stand when I practice and I am always misplacing pencils , erasers , and even my phone ! They used to disappear behind the music books or fall on the floor , but now I simply place them on this little shelf under the stand . Very convenient . It does have a tendency to slip off , so I used a little double sided mounting tape to hold it in place .
5 #### A bit more expensive , but excellent quality and fit and no " fuzzy " lint on the keys . Fits my Korg Kross very well ! Gator has always made quality stuff - same story here .
5 #### Always use Motorcraft parts in my fleet trucks . Great deal , shipped to my office .
5 #### I purchased this item for our LG Shine Cell phone that we have . My fiancee uses the phone for work and wanted to put some music on the phone and pictures . This SD card was inexpensive and holds a lot of music and pictures . It works perfectly for what we purchased it for . I would n't hesitate to purchase this item again . As it does exactly what it is suppose to .
5 #### This case is stunning , and looks beautiful on my phone . the quality is amazing , and its all i ever wanted .
5 #### A must buy for home great cord length 6 ac plugs surge ac protector if plug overloads ...
4 #### I 'm not going to lie , I was a little disappointed after using this . But it 's a descent price . I definitely need a different type now to cushion my back panel still from the sub .
5 #### Can make cheap guitars sound even wholer with a great slick feel to them and they last quite a while originally bought them because of a friend and do not regret my purchase .
4 #### Very similar to the vandoren in the grey box it 's a matter of preference when it comes to choice
5 #### I carry these in my tool box and found them handy to use , especaily with the different colors to chose . I have used them to temporarily hold something in place while I am trying to drill it in place . I have even connected severl together for larger items .
5 #### It works perfectly . What can I say other than that ? The inexpensive Brother PT-80 Personal Labeler ( Navy Blue / Green ) that this goes with is awesome , so I pay the price for the refills gladly .
5 #### Thanks , it arrived on time and is satisfied with the way things was handled in a prompt manage business and shipping wise .
5 #### goes good with black guitar and is comfortable light weight .
4 #### Does its job , but nothing notable that will make me rave about it
5 #### ... at least somebody is catering to this market . There are so many products out there ( cables , power , etc . ) that are so obviously designed to make money by giving you the cheapest possible components . I purchase my Monster products with delight because at least they APPEAR to care about quality . I have never actually compared this power strip to another by watching the same video feed and can not say for sure that it does what it says with regard to filtering AC pollution . BUT , I do know that AC pollution exists and sometimes my mobile video equipment will pick up radio signals and corrupt microphone recordings . This power strip does completely eliminate RF ( radio frequency ) interference , and that alone made it worth the purchase for me .
4 #### I can talk for over 5 continuous hours on this headset ( never tried longer ) . However , my Motorola HS820 is more comfortable AND my callers understand me better . I get many complaints with the Scala 700 that my voice is n't clear or our connection is bad . In addition , when I listen to mp3 files , the HS820 has a warmer sound . The Scala 700 has a ' tinty ' sound . The Scala 700 comes with a proprietary usb and a case . Nice .
5 #### This is the best bluetooth device I 've tried . It is lightweight , comfortable , easy to set - up , good sound clarity and it is a very well made and sturdy device . There are n't flimsy parts that can break . The best thing is that the ear peace is fairly inconspicuous as it sits over your ear . I really do n't want to look like Janet Jackson in her Control video as I walk around town or the mall . The problem is in finding replacement ear gels . They are not available on the Jabra site or on any other site . I ended up back at Cingular ( now AT & T ) and they gave me a couple that they had in a drawer .
3 #### I replaced my stock fender strings with these , and they definitely hurt my fingers more . I am a beginner , so I do n't do that much sliding back and forth . I imagine these coated strings would be better for that type of stuff .
4 #### It works very well for getting up and down on the bed of the truck to . It really offers stability .
5 #### This was for a 32 inch LCD . Easy to install and works great . I am very satisfied with this wall mount .
5 #### This cable is just what you need for non - professional non - demanding studio use . I do n't know if I 'd trust it for regular gigs but it works very well for light work .
5 #### love the color , and it holds all of my guitars and basses with no issues . Asymmetrical headstocks may cause the guitar to list to one side a bit , but it has no threat of headstocks slipping through or off of the hook . Even my Telecaster hangs with no issues , and is not resting on the tuning keys , which is sometimes the case with wall hangers . Holds the guitar far enough off of the wall that you really do not need bumpers to protect the body from swinging into the wall . Even with large bodied acoustics , there is plenty of room . Comes with really good mounting hardware , and you have the option of mounting directly to a stud , or mounting on drywall using the screw - in style anchors that are included . For the money , you ca n't beat these !
4 #### Very well made , and the wire is heavy , looks like an eight gaugewire . It will serve you well if you need this item Thank 's
5 #### I bought this cable 4 years ago when I bought a Samsung personal laser printer and discovered it had no USB cable ! Looked around stores and saw no - name cables going for $ 15-$20 and started to get really mad . Then I checked Amazon and saw this beauty for only $ 5 . It 's a really good cable . The construction and materials are solid , and I have never had any issues with it . I 've always been able to trust Belkin to make good cables . Now I 'm picking up another one just to have around as a spare to hook up various devices to my laptop .
5 #### I do n't understand why more people do not use this product . I have been using Rain - x for about 20 years now . I love driving when it rains because I do n't have to use my wipers . In 20 years I have bought more bottles of Rain - x than I have sets of wipers .
5 #### Krusell is a well known manufacturer for quality and perfect fit . This is no exception . I own a Krusell brand case for my Dell Axim and recently purchased this one for my Razr . Craftsmanship is excellent , stitches are very well aligned as well as opening for USB connection . It fits perfectly on my Razr . I looked at all available Razr cases before I bought this and realized I made a good decision .
5 #### Great little amp ! I wish it had an headphone jack but still great for practicing and loud enough for for small jams . Looks better then the picture too !
5 #### Great product , it work as it was stated on the web site
4 #### These just sound flat in comparison to Elixir Nanowebs and they do n't feel as good either . I guess I just prefer coated acoustic strings .
5 #### I bought this pedal locally during a holiday sale and am impressed with how it sounds with a bass guitar . The simple yet effective knob works great in getting just enough effect through my amp 's signal . I also like the depth switch when used with the bass . I can scoop the mids , increase the rate on the pedal and get alot of useable tones . I play a jazz bass and can get tones with just a touch of chrorus to spacey tones with the knob all the way to the right . I have another chorus pedal for bass and this one has replaced it so to speak . I received the unusual 1/8 connector with the pedal and the only downside of the pedal is if you misplace the adaptor like I did , keep an eye on it and find some great tones . EHX is a quality brand and make alot of bass friendly pedals in the USA , I strongly reccomend this pedal for any guitarist or bassist looking for a basic reliable chrous pedal .
3 #### After reading other reviews , I got this unit over the Cobra , If mounting is a priority for you get the Cobra . I 'm having a hard time to get this mounted in a clean way like the Cobra would be . Other then that it word fine .
4 #### These are okay strings for the Folk Guitar ............. nothing special but the price is n't out of the world either . Good buy for the money . Tried them on a Gibson J50 and they seem to do good .
4 #### This thing does just what it was supposed to , i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that , and it does just what it is supposed to
4 #### I bought this to replace a Jawbone Icon HD that 's microphone stopped working . It works , it 's quiet compared to the Icon which was quiet when paired with my crappy Samsung Gusto II work phone . It 's looking like it 's going to be a pain while in my noisy van and driving . Pairing was annoying , as others have said the instructions are wrong . It say to " Press and hold the power button " lol the power switch is not a button , and the button needed to be pressed was not obvious . I did manage to accidentally find said button and also pair to my phone . Update : It 's not as quiet now , I turned the volume up(duh ! ) . However there is either no noise cancelling or it just is n't effective . I gave it an extra star , since it 's not quiet anymore .
5 #### After trying many different brands and types of strings over a few years , I always come back to ( and now exclusively use ) D'Addarios . They last longer , stay in tune better , and overall are high quality strings . I 've used Ernie Ball Slinkys , DR , and other brands , but found myself breaking strings regularly . These strings rarely break , and I change them half as often . Features that make these stand out : -The packaging is good . Minimal waste compared to some brands , and the corrosion resistant bags mean I can store extra sets in my guitar case and know they 'll be fresh when I need them . -The color - coded ball ends are a nice touch , making string changes faster . -Usually available in discounted multi - packs . I 've found the best deal can usually be found ordering 10 packs .
4 #### Does what it is supposed to do . Heavy metal construction ; should last long . My only complaint is that I would have preferred to have the receptacles turned the opposite way from each other on the double row to better accommodate transformers . I like the long , 15 foot , cord ; it eliminates the need for an extra extension cord in most situations .
4 #### Bought this for my 10yo son . Its almost too long for him . Seems good quality for the price . Functions fine . I m sure when it breaks in it ll soften up but right out of the box its stiff and abrasive . Hindsight I would have got a cotton one .
2 #### The cradle that holds the cell phone is an extremely poor design . There is absolutely no give in the arms that hold the phone so the phone either flops around or is too tight . I have another cell phone cradle which works much better at holding the phone . It snaps closed around the phone holding it secure . The other issue is that it does does not work on cars that have a large glass sunroof . There is not enough metal around the base of the antenna as required .
4 #### Cables work as expected and they are twice a long as standard cables . I would have give them 5 starts but I bought a few cables and I did have some failures ( bad cables ) in the pack .
5 #### I really love this kensington lock . It just snaps right in . No little plug for the whole is necessary . The part that locks into the whole is built onto the end of the cable . It took me a few minutes to figure out that I had to use the key to attach the lock to the Lap Top but once I figured out how to use it , it is a very quick lock or un - lock . ( I could have read the directions but where 's the fun in that . )
5 #### works great , a bit hard to buff off , but what a shine on dark colors
1 #### The cable is good , but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4 . It does plug in , but not far enough in to hold securely .
4 #### This booster is easy to install , and properly performs . The reception performance prior to use was spotty , usually with no bars . Now there is a constant one bar . The unit is easily installed inside with a window stick mount which I used . A better mount would be to place the antenna outside on the roof , but unit does adequately with the inside window cup mount . The only necessary talent is to observe where signal is strongest after consulting a map for transmission towers .
5 #### I love these clamps ! They go on fast , can turn in whatever direction you want , and they hold everything ! Price is right and they are good quality . I have a pair of speaker stands that I use these on that are in between sizes and I just put a little piece of foam in the " C " of the clamp and it tightens it right up . Now I just hang all of my lights off my speaker stands !
2 #### The stand I received was not what I expected at all ! The upper tube fit crooked , instead of straight , which just seems to be a design flaw in the joint fitting . The tilter also leaves a lot to be desired . It could n't support a heavy 21 " ride cymbal without having to really apply a lot of torque to the nut . I personally wish they 'd ditch this stand & bring back the 900 series which is a far superior " heavy duty " stand IMHO .
3 #### It 's ok but the lack of IS makes this long zoom hard to use on a crop body . On the plus side it 's light and cheep . If you 're looking for something in this focal length I would not recommend this lens unless you 're really on a budget .
1 #### This item worked for a while then just cut off and that was the end of it that 's all there is to say
5 #### this is more that awesome , perfect fit and super easy installation , it took me about 5 min to install ( no .. I am not and old guy , I am 25 ) however I 'll leave a photo here~~
3 #### I bought this while ago to use my bluetooth music screaming and the fm trasimitter on my Lexus . All that worked pretty good but one using it to acutally make a call it was n't so hot for the person I was talking to .
3 #### I ca n't rate these tapes . I tape a program wkly & send it to my son . He watches them . I guess they work ; have n't heard any problem from him .
2 #### I use this every day to listen to my iPhone while exercising . It works well if you adjust it carefully , but that 's the rub . The adjustment loop on the band tends to slip , so each day I need to readjust . The " FastFit " clasp makes this difficult ; to get " the right fit " , you need to undo the clasp , adjust , then clasp to test the fit , a tedious process . It usually either slides down my arm , or is a little too tight but not quite sufficiently uncomfortable to bother undoing it to adjust again .
4 #### Did n't need it for the job , but it came quick and looks to be of good quality
5 #### I have a Palm Pre Plus with AT&T and the one included charger was n't enough . I bought two of these and they are perfect ! It does n't look exactly like the one that came with the phone , but it works the same . They are a great product for a great price . Highly recommended .
5 #### I 've been playing slinky 's for around 15 years now , I 've tried various sizes , and the Skinny Top Heavy Bottom 's have become my absolute favorite . They 're exactly as they sound , the thicker EAD allow for some great chording tone for rock , while the slightly skinnier top strings allow bending to still be easy enough that I 'll actually want to do it . Try em , you 'll like them .
5 #### Before I buy anything I look at the reviews I weigh the good and bad . This had alot of reviews and people were loving the feel . A few comments about bulky came up ... This is how I felt . I got this in the mail I left it on the mock steering wheel it came on becase I heard of other people saying it was hard to stay on . A few days later I was able to put it on very easy . Took seconds to do . I am a new driver and I thought this might distract me while driving , but I could n't take the feel of the slim steering wheel . This product was the best ever . The feel and look is amazing esp at the price given . It made driving easier and control of the car was mch better . I felt I had a better grip . This is the one :) God Bless !
5 #### Ca n't beat it . Changed strings on my Norman accoustic in about 15 mins . Great tool at a great price .
5 #### Tried and true- best conditioner you can buy in my opinion .
4 #### Sets under the left side frame rail under the drivers door . ( 2005 Ford F150 ) ... If you have the proper filter wrench it 's a very fast job .
3 #### This little level works as well as most . Though it is fairly large to be mounted on the outside of an RV I think . To take care of this problem I mounted it on the inside of my LP gas bottle door . Not only is it out of the way it is protected from the elements . It remains easy to use as I only have to open the door when raising or lowering the 5th wheel to see the level .
1 #### I live in a rural area with marginal cell phone reception and had high hopes for this unit . Unfortunately , I ended up disappointed . The installation of the weBoost Drive Cell Phone Booster Kit is very easy : place the magnet - mount antenna on the car roof , run the cable in through the door and attach it to the unit , then attach the power cord and plug it into the car 's lighter outlet . My HTC One M8 phone , at 3 - 1/6 inches wide including Otterbox case , just barely fit into the unit 's cradle , which must be used . The instructions suggest powering up the Weboost and watching the bars rise . Starting with 1/2 bar , I plugged it in , looking forward to doing exactly that . No rise . The power adapter showed only a solid red light . The instructions direct the user to the online manual for this issue . After something of a fishing expedition , I found the manual , which says the red light means the unit has powered off due to oscillation and the fix is to move the antenna . Unfortunately , moving the antenna did not change anything . The quick - start installation instructions say the antenna must be mounted at least 6 inches from a window ; the user manual suggests 8 - 10 inches . Within those parameters , the antenna is as far from the unit as it can be while still being mounted on the roof of my full - size car . The instructions next suggest calling customer support . I 'll update this review if that proves to be helpful .
5 #### I have two white vehicles and this stuff just melts the tar off . Works better on tar than bugs but bugs you can get off with regular soap . This stuff makes tar just wipe off no scrubbing and does n't hurt the paint . I suggest washing afterwords just to get the solvent residue off . But awesome stuff .
5 #### I recently changed jobs and have to drive approximately 35 miles each way on the interstate . I found myself in several traffic jams / delays needing to use a cb radio to talk to truckers about the traffic delays . I 've owned cb radios many years ago - I do n't need anything fancy with all the bells n whistles . I compare spending money on a cb radio with a bass boat .......... 80 % price in the motor & 20 % in the boat hull*****80 % price in the antenna & 20 % in the cb radio ! You do n't need a fancy cb radio , just a good quality cb and a higher end , better quality antenna . You simply ca n't go cheap with the antenna and transmit good ! I matched this cb with a " lil - will " antenna and it transmits very good with crystal clear reception . VERY PLEASED :-)
5 #### This is excellent ! I lay it on my just washed truck then drag across to remove all the water with one pass . Wring it out and keep going . Very satisfied
3 #### These are the best deal for drumsticks but there 's one problem - LET US CHOSE THE SIZE ! I know it 's a ' mix bag ' meaning you randomly get one of 3 sizes but they sell these for the same price at Guitar Center and you can pick the size there , the trouble is that Guitar Centers are rarely close to where you actually live and Guitar Center themselves have these sold with no choice of size on their website . BE A PIONEER , LIST THE SIZE CHOICES ON HERE AND I'LL NEVER BUY DRUMSTICKS ANYWHERE ELSE !
3 #### I 've had this pair of headphones for three years now , so here 's my review . Aftermarket earpads or not , these headphones deliver some balanced ( if not mid - heavy ) sound with decent isolation . If you do n't enjoy the balanced sound , then just color it and you 'll get what you want without having to worry much about balancing . There are a few cons : 1 ) Ear sweat with the stock earpads : they 're pleather and not the least bit porous . Your ears will get warm and start to itch after a few hours of listening . 2 ) Mids leak like crazy . 3 ) The biggest con , however , is related to the cable : the coated wiring inside is not very durable . Twice , I 've had to re - solder the ground ( green ) wire and one of the other cables after they 've frayed ( internally ) . Always at the same spot , too : right before the first loop on the coil ; at the top ( starting from the left driver ) . The easiest way to tell if YOUR ground wire has frayed is if you 're getting crossfeed : sounds from one channel playing on the other . In summary : balanced sound , decent isolation , leaky mids , internal wires not durable . Have wire cutters , a soldering iron , and electrical tape ready just in case .
5 #### I bought this to help in our phone reception . It does the job well . Thanks for the help to keep connected .
4 #### So far so good . I unfortunately wo n't be giving it the fifth star until I see how long it lasts . My last SSD I upgraded too was made by crucial and it went out one month after the warrantee was up . As one would think , it went with out warning and Booop ! Gone . Yet this SSD has some pretty good ratings and was also 256 GB . Therefore I went ahead and made the purchase and even put up an blog post on how I installed it into my Samsung Series 9 ultrabook ( Link below ) . Have n't had any trouble with it yet though , but I have only had it for around a month . Installed Win 8.1 on it , runs super smooth ... plus I would almost go as far to say that the write time to disk is even a tad bit faster than the SanDisk one that came with my laptop(128 GB ) . All - in - all I would recommend this hard drive to anyone whom is looking for a new SSD with a bit more room on it . Remember it is mSATA though .. so make sure you are looking for a new one for an ultrabook or something with the right connections ... (This baby is SMALL ) Enjoy ! [ ... ]
4 #### Worked as described . As with all tools like this , you only need it when you screw up . Lots of YouTube videos showing how to use . Good price AFAIK .
2 #### i felt this book did not flow well it started off okay and then just did not explain things very well this book was very short , just over 100 pages and the characters were not well developed at all so you just seemed to go off on a dull ride without really having any feelings toward the characters or what was happening
4 #### I put this on an 02 4runner , and it looks great . It 's a very soft leather that feels awesome . As others have noted , to do this correctly it is verrrry time consuming . I definitely recommend doing the cross stitch method as compared to the straight stitch method . It will be much tighter and look better . I messed up the first few stitches and had to undo about 2 " worth to fix it . I also was n't careful enough when pulling the thread to keep the strings untangled and ended up with a few knots , which make this much more difficult pulling through the holes . A small shepherds hook is a must have for this to pull your stitches tight as you go . All in all , it took me about 4 hours to do this , but this was my first cover and I took my time to make sure it was done right . I plan on doing another one on my Tacoma , but need to work back up the motivation to destroy my hands and sit in my vehicle for several hours .
3 #### looks good . if they do n't come damaged . They do n't stay on the phone very well , especially around the edges . If they stuck to the phone better i would give 5 stars . They look really good and easy to see through , they just do n't stay on well
5 #### This recorder is perfect for my students who enjoy listening to a story on cassette . They also love taping themselves reading on tape .
5 #### Very nice capo that can ride right on the guitar head until needed . Works great and priced right .
5 #### Having this item makes it easy to pull a stuck mouthpiece and saves money from going to the instrument shop .
5 #### Needed this to get the crank pulley off my Pilot to change the timing belt . Worked great .
5 #### Bought this as part of a camera package we gave our granddaughter for Christmas . She loves the camera and accessories and shoots beautiful pictures of friends , family and still life . She likes the bag because she can carry her camera and extra lens .
3 #### These are nice optics ! So , Canon , why not include dust lens covers ? ! Come on ! Buyers : plan on purchasing pairs of screw on UV filters to protect the coated optices and lens caps !
5 #### Even though I use a 20 , I really lay into it because I 've played more heavier stuff years ago . Even with the front head on , this gives my a much thuddier sound than say a pinstripe . Tune it low , lower pitched thud . Higher , higher pitched thud . The one constant is the thud . Perfect bass drum sound imho . Trust me on this one . I 've used every bass head on the market .
5 #### I bought this to connect my XBOX to a switch box that I also connect my computer to . I use the switch box to connect them to my cable box for my internet . The cable was long enough and works great . Good price too , would buy again if I ever need another .
5 #### Great Product This product is exactly as described and does a great job , it is very easy to use
5 #### Excellent product ! Packs good lows and mids with pretty good bass . For the last 6 years , I was using Sony MDR710 , excellent portable headphones . I ordered Sennheiser PX200 II recently but found it greatly lacked the bass ! Returned it and ordered these seeing the great reviews . It 's just a few notches down as compared to Sony MDR710 / Sennheiser PX 200II . But has good bass as compared to PX 200 , which cost ten times more !
5 #### A fantastic radio . What it lacks in special accessories , it makes up for in quality . Great job , Uniden !
4 #### Unfortunately the little sticker that you attach to the back of your phone did n't adhear to my phone 's case , but I can tell you that this product is well made and a great idea . I might get a new phone case just so I can use the mount . It 's small and unobtrusive . For the price , you ca n't beat it . Looks a LOT better than those huge things that clamp around your phone .
1 #### This review has been changed due to the change in the product description . This was originally advertised as a wireless charging product with wired charging capability . The controversy over the wireless aspect has led to a device title name that is now impossible to knock as deceptive . It is a Powermat . If you are the type of person who will go out of your way to cut cable clutter at all costs , including the loss of simultaneous usability while charging , than perhaps this may work for your needs . Cable / Clutter Phobic : This personality aspect does exist . Although cables still provide the fastest delivery of data , charge and functionality above all wireless alternatives to date there are people who will go out of their way to avoid having a visible cable . Wireless option , yes . Easier than a USB plug , no . Cutting clutter , if you do n't consider the mat and the wireless charging case clutter . Personally , picking up a cable already sitting on my night stand , desk , or console is as easy as it gets . As a multifunctional charging base , make sure that you investigate fully what comes in the box and the additional potential purchase requirements for devices not supported with or without optional accessories .
5 #### Thick , Very full sound . Beautiful . They make my cheap guitar sound very groovy . Smooth , even the thickest gauge . Definitely worth the $ .
3 #### The service was very good and what I expected recibir . Muy good , keep it up , thank you
5 #### I really have n't used them . I tested them out and I liked the clarity of the sound . I like how lightweight they are . Excellent quality for the great low price .
5 #### Tapes work just as expected . Good recording quality and good durability .
5 #### I love these Reiko lanyards ; have bought several in different colors , to match various iphone color cases . I wear one all the time ; it has never failed me . It keeps my phone near , and the fact that i can unlatch the phone when need be is the clincher for me . I am hooked :-) On the few occasions when i 've dumped my phone in my purse ( on the run ) , the lanyard makes it extremely easy to find / grab ahold of . I would n't be without this lanyard - not as long as i have a mobile phone .
1 #### I purchased this manual to do a head gasket replacement on my 1999 Wrangler . Haynes was always the resource for serious mechanics many years ago but that has obviously changed . Trying to pack to many vehicles in to one manual is a bad idea for starters . My biggest complaint is that once I had my engine back together I put on a new distributor , rotor , wires and plugs . According to the manual the # 1 plug is located in the back . That seemed odd to me but since I took the wires off two weeks before and did n't pay attention to the firing order since I had a manual . After wasting several hours of my time I went to the Internet for answers . The first thing I found was several references to # 1 being in the front right were I expected it should have been . After 2 minutes to switch the wires around the Jeep fired right up and sounds good . How can you publish a manual with a major error like that ?
4 #### Has held up thru lots of use . The last one I had of a different brand fell apart after a couple of weeks . I will be buying more of these .
5 #### Work perfectly . If you need more than 8 ports like me I would recommend .
4 #### The iTorch feels nice and sturdy in your hand and also comes with a convenient carrying pouch to keep the battery pack and usb cable together . The built in laser pointer is definitely a handy addition to the power pack that is great for presentations . The added led flashlight is also useful . However , it is n't as bright as I would have liked . I like the fact that the battery pack charges by microusb . This makes it much easier to charge when you are traveling as almost everything has a USB port . When using the battery pack to charge my iPhone , it was very fast . The added capacity that the battery pack provides gave me more than enough power to be unplugged from the wall for the whole day and more . Overall , I am very impressed with the iTorch IMP52D and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a USB Battery Pack .
5 #### This product , like many people have experienced , is very well made , and great to have around , and many are working at 30 years of age . I have no real complaints about the quality of this product for my primary use , which is speedily checking the pressure and airing up the tires for my trucks , trailers , daily drivers . The only flaw with my gauge , which does n't bother me , is it tends to read about three pounds high , which I just started mentally compensating for . For stuff I am concerned with getting very accurate , or low pressure readings , ( motorcycle , ATV , drag slicks , high performance radials ) I still use a quality gauge to check the pressures anyway .
1 #### Please please do n't waste your money on these headfhones . I did n't exspect great sound for under ten dollars , but I did not exspect to have know sound all , which is what I got . Going into the trash as it would cost more to return it then I paid for it .
4 #### Initially I forgot to update my Wii settings to output picture display from 480i to 480p . Although I had no issues with the cable , the image quality really did not improve . I use Wii Sport and Wii Fit . My TV is a Samsung 40inch 1080p . Quite frankly , for the applications I use I would have been just as happy with the supplied cable from Nintendo .
4 #### Handy and the right size . Took it all over Europe with us . It served well .
3 #### These strings are looser and lighter than D'Addario EJ45 's are . They sound quite bright for high tension , but they do n't hold a tune especially well , and they flap quite widely . Personally , I would n't call them high tension at all . This is an issue for me , because I have the action set fairly low on this guitar , and I 'm getting a lot of buzz with anything but the gentlest attack . I do n't mind a little buzz , especially during more vigorous , percussive parts , but this is too much . Someone who plays classical(instead of the Latin and rumba flamenca that I lean toward ) might have their action set higher , and so they might appreciate the bright sound and relatively light gauge , but that 's not what I was looking for when I purchased a high tension string set .
5 #### My favorite brand of swabs . Quality silk , it can be used for both the instrument body and for the neck .
5 #### These look great , contour with the vehicle , are easy to install and best of all .......... are INEXPENSIVE ! The last several cars I 've had I have bought a set of " vent shades " from my local " truck accessory " store and it cost me $ 90.00 a set . I thought these were probably $ 70 for the item and about $ 20 to have them installed , boy was I wrong . I bought a set for my 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 , Quad Cab truck and the vent shades cost about $ 44.00 and took me maybe 10 minutes to install and they look GREAT ! I recommend these to anyone in the market for vent shades for your car , truck or van .
5 #### This arrived in a timely fashion and worked as advertised .
4 #### Good product at the right price . Very happy with the purchase .
5 #### The Innocase II for Droid Incredible is a great case for a great price . It does n't add too much to the size of the phone and protects it really well . The only negative thing I can say for it is that it sometimes move the Invisishield I have on , creating an air bubble , usually the corners . This is probably due to me installing the Invisishield wrong . All in all , this is a great case that all Incredible owners should own .
5 #### Got the white ones too . Really good product and it sticks very securely .
4 #### If you 've read the other reviews you already know that it takes an hour or more to install this . The tan color is darker than the picture but blends well with my interior . The material was thick and substantial , the needles worked ( I used only one and it did n't break ) , the lacing was adequate and the directions explained three different methods of lacing . I chose the easiest and the job took about one hour . My steering wheel measured 15 - 1/2 " and this size was very tight but it made the install look nice when completed . I deducted a star because my steering wheel only has two spokes , at 8 and 4 o'clock and they are about 3 " wide . This left a gap where the cover could not be laced around the steering wheel and was loose when the job was done , looked a little unprofessional . I remedied that by sticking a proper size piece of two sided foam tape under the cover and it stuck to the steering wheel spoke . Now there is not a loose gap there and it is tight all around the wheel . Edit : May 6 , 2012 , over two years later this item is still in good condition , the laces are intact and it has lots of use left in it . I think it 's well worth the money .
5 #### they fit my phone and they are a good price plus they are easy to apply and do n't leave bubbles .
5 #### This is a very good all natural odor eliminator . I use it in my car in the back window and it keeps it smelling like new .
5 #### This absorber tile works very well it saves using a lot of towels all in one easy to clean and fold up and put back in container and ready to use the next time they must have
4 #### Looks nice , easy to apply .. just applied them so not sure how well they will stay put . My family could n't tell until I told them that I had put them on , they said it looks natural . I had to apply the sticky part to some of my paint which I was n't thrilled about . I plan on a paint job so that is kind of a mute point for now unless they fall off and pull off some paint before I am able to get my car painted .
5 #### Love the stability - I have purchased several of these as I need them - They always perform well
5 #### Works well but slowly with little or no damage to light tan leathers . Highly recommended takes several cleanings for harder markes .
5 #### Used as a mod mic for my audio technica ad700 . until mod mic 4.0 comes out , Cheap and gets the job done
3 #### Sure help with the cooling , but very fragile . Not even a month , the side of the item is already ripping .
5 #### I save a lot of money purchasing these on Amazon . My daughter likes the vandoren brand because they give her better sound .
4 #### This shell / holster combo provides great protection for the Droid without adding too much bulk . Also , unlike some of the cases with magnetic closure , this will not activate dock mode and drain the battery . Really good deal for the price . Get it here on Amazon and pay about half what Verizon sells them for .
5 #### If you care about your batteries - This is a must to help care of your batteries
5 #### I bought this from AMS , who had a better price on it at the time . I think they are comparable now though . Anyway , i love this little amp . The battery charge lasts me around ten to twelve hours , which i consider to be great . The fact that you can plug it in when you need to is an added bonus . It 's also a pretty balsy little amp . I would n't go so far as to call the patented Pignose distortion amazing ( it 's really more like a light fuzz or compressor ) , but it does the job ( plus , if you are like me , you 've got some distortion pedals to use anyway ) . The volume levels are fairly beefy though when it needs to be . The primary advantage to this amp is obviously its portability or use at home when you really should n't be playing uber - loud , like at night when your downstairs neighbor or your wife is trying to sleep . It only weighs a few pounds ( i ca nt remember the actual weight , although I 'm sure the specs on the item page list it ) and can pretty much be toted anywhere you need to go . Although i sometimes play my Les Paul through it , it is particularly well suited for my Ibanez Acoustic Electric . All in all , a great amp at a great price .
5 #### this will do the job I have intended nicely . looks easy enough to assemble and make the run keeping the wire safe
5 #### Not complicated ... push half way to focus , all the way to release shutter , slide up for extended open shutter ( bulb mode ) . Easy peasy . I did n't even look at the manual .
4 #### Purchased these for my niece . Good so far . I will update if they go bad or do n't last long .
5 #### They fit nicely and seem to be made to last . I put over 700 miles on my Jeep in very windy conditions this past weekend and they did n't move a bit .
5 #### First was DOA . But Odyssy took care of it . These batteries really pack a punch . Works much better than lead acid in my Victory . I highly recommend .
4 #### Works fine . Reasonable price . The clip is pretty bulky and could definitely be a little smaller .
2 #### After a few weeks , the back of the device broke off in the charge , exposing the circuit board and preventing from charging . I super glued it back on and covered the glue mess with black marker . I ran into someone at work and asked him about his . Sure enough , he had the exact same problem ( even used a marker to cover the glue marks ) . The other day , I drop it on the ground ( not an uncommon occurrence for bluetooth headsets ) and the metal ear loop snap off ! This thing is a piece of junk . Even if it never broke , it 's difficult to carry in a pocket due to the big ear loop . Also difficult to put on . I 'd recommend avoiding this product .
1 #### Shattered the first time I tried to attach it to a snare drum rim . On stage , in a big hurry , disappointed .
5 #### The stands appear to be well made and are definitely heavier than my 2 ton stands . The height range is 15.25 " to 23 15/16 " . They are not double - locking but it 's always a good idea to leave your floor jack in place for added safety if you plan to work under the vehicle . See added pic of stand next to Toyota FJ with 3 " lift . These stands are well worth the money , especially considering you get free shipping .
4 #### As noted by others , these cable covers are easy to cut , mount and use . They are very easy to open ( used a flat head screwdriver ) and easy to put your cable and power cord into . If not stuffed with more than two cords , they are easy to close too . Also as noted , the adhesive is strong ... so have your channel in the right place before removing the protective film or else you risk it getting stuck in some undesirable position and making a mess if you try to move it . The film was easy to pull off with the channel sitting right in the place we wanted to install it , so it should not be an issue if you do good prep work . The channels really look great in place ! My only wishes would be : ( 1 ) Wish the channels were roomier as they max it one power cord and one cable or they wo n't close properly ; ( 2 ) Wish that the T - junctions and corner elbow covers could be made a bit oversized ... I had to use a cable - splitter at a T junction , and had to run an small two - prong extension cord to an elbow , and both remain uncovered as the respective covers are just too small . All considered , good product that I would recommend .
5 #### BINGO ! Works as advertised . Really does stick to the floor with the velcro and weight
1 #### Large ear piece did not fit in my ear . Very uncomfortable . Ear piece was broken upon receipt . Charger is not standard . Recommend that you keep looking .
5 #### great little funnel , long narrow output is good for transmission fluid or other stuff similar with a small opening not easy to get to .
5 #### Simple , strong , light weight and it folds flat for storage - what else could you want ? Like all Manhasset products ( I LOVE their sheet music / copy stnads ! ) this is quality stuff but reasonably priced . Set this on a desktop , add scripts and a nearby microphone and start reading , particularly good for audio book recording and podcasting . H2
5 #### Good product I will buy again , good price , fast shipping ! ! !
4 #### I installed these on a 2014 Ford F150 SuperCab . I have a Truxedo Truxsport that covers my bedrail pockets . The Bully Clamps installed easy and seem to hold solid . I have yet to use them as tie downs for my motorcycle . I like that they fold down in a " locked " position when not in use . I plan to order two more set to install in the middle an back of my bed .
3 #### If you are like me , you are n't going to buy a DVD player toplay games with zoom , freeze frame , etc . What I believe most consumersare looking for are a well built machine that delivers a high quality picture and audiophile sound . The Toshiba delivers on sound and picture , but not on manufacturing quality . For [ the price range ] , maybe I should n't be so picky , but here are my gripes : 1 . The tray is flimsy , wiggling up and down . 2 . The machine weighs about 3 - 4 pounds . 3 . There is a ticking sound while the disc is spinning that can be heard from my listening position 13 feet away . 4 . The CD sound is better through the RCA outputs than the coaxial cable . 5 . In order to return to a prior track , you have to double click the back arrow , and even then it 's hit or miss . 6 . On some occasions on DVD , when the movie starts , the audio is undiscernable . If the DVD is removed and then reinserted , this corrects the problem . This has been reported by others ...
5 #### Helped me to fix my motorcycle seat mount tabs , I had stripped the bolt holes from removing the seat so many times .
5 #### Arrived fast . Great Shape . This is a gift and I think the person will love this b / c new strings are always needed
3 #### Phone came in good physical condition , but after inserting my sim card , to my surprise , the phone was still locked ! to make matters worst battery was not taking any charging . However after contacting the seller I was refunded for the cost of unlocking the phone locally . Response was quick and hustle free I must say . However I ended up had to replace the battery .
5 #### For leisure listening , you 'll need to play around with some EQ settings in your music player . If you need to hear the little details in a song you 're learning or in something you just recorded , this headset is great . Everything comes through real clean and clear imo . There 's a reason these have been around forever . It 's a great product .
5 #### Best product on the market for cleaning out fuel systems . Ran a can through my Dodge Cummins and it idles smooth as silk . I use it in my ATVs , lawn mower , backhoe , and all my cars . Great product , and it actually works .
5 #### This battery was for an older LG phone . It was the same battery as the original and a LG brand . Works well with phone and the phone works like new . The battery arrived about four days earlier than estimated arrival date . My origianl battery can no longer hold a charge . This battery resolved the problem .
5 #### Rugged heavy wire and rubber case . I did n't expect it to be that rugged ( 10 gauge - 30A ) . Not for an inline fuse for your ipod , but good for many other high current draw protections .
5 #### If you want a book light to use when reading in the dark or low - light , I recommend the Mighty Bright TravelFlex Book Light . It is reasonably priced , well - made , light and small , easily positioned over a book page or Kindle display screen , attaches quickly and securely , the light is bright and the battery life is exceptional . And , it comes in several appealing colors . I have four of them - one I keep in my purse , one in my camping and vacation satchel , one in the living room , and one in the bedroom .
3 #### These things are hard to use . Did n't really help much .
5 #### These should be evaluated against other " disposable " headphones , not against serious audiophile headphones . They reproduce voices clearly , and music sounds good ( albeit with limited high treble and low bass production . ) These are the perfect headphones for travel , for travel in areas you might get your headphones lost or stolen in , etc .
4 #### happy & with price agood string for the price I yhink I prefer the more expensive line of Martin string they last 5 times linger before changing .
4 #### This New Black Covered Handcuff Case is decent quality for the price . I was given a set of handcuffs so wanted an inexpensive case to hold them on my duty belt . The case attaches securely to the belt by Velcro backing both directly to the belt and to itself , making it unlikely that this will move once it is positioned where needed . The flap has both Velcro and a snap to keep it closed . My only issue is that this is somewhat wider than really needed so I also store a set of Latex Examination Gloves in the case along with the handcuffs to keep them from rattling around . Recommended ! CFH
5 #### This works well and is comfortable , vs the couple of MOT headsets I bought , which were horible . The volume level is good for me , and I have hearing loss , so that 's impressive as well . The contols are easy to use . I 'm using this with an older MOT V330 . Highly recommended for both the performance and price . Oh , contrary to another reviewers suggestion , it will not fit into a mint tin due to it 's width . I have n't found a good hard - case solution for it yet . Update on 8/16/08 : I thought I lost my 510 , so after reviewing all the newer units , I bought another one ! The newer models appear to be riddled with minor bugs & issues , so why not stick with a winner ? I 'm now using this with my T - Mobile Dash and it works great for the voice command features . My office was trying to decide on which model to go with , so we ordered up a half a dozen latest models of headsets . I added my own to the evaluation pool . After two weeks of testing , almost everyone liked the 510 better than all the rest , so we ordered up 20 of them ! If this model was discontinued and I needed a new headset , I 'd go with the latest " jawbone " ; which worked fine , had better wind resistance , but did n't have quite the all - day comfort or inherent design durability of the 510 . Hope this helps !
4 #### For the price this is a great stand I can not complain . But the shipping was horrible when I received it the box was all torn up with wholes in it everywhere . The stand in side had one smaller dent and a few light scratches but still worked fine . I used it for one show and that was it maybe I 'll try and figure out how to sell it back on amazon since I sold all my other equipment and have no use for it .
4 #### If you go with Amazon Prime membership , this is a great example of how it benefits you as a buyer . Free two day shipping , and a working product , delivered within the time stated , received in good working order . I change my musical configuration a lot and having a set of good midi cables is very important .
5 #### I love this thing . It dries my car and keeps it from getting any water marks .
5 #### My side usb port quit working on my Blackberry . The only way to charge my unit is with this desktop model as it charges the BB via the terminals on the bottom of the phone . If I did n't have this product , I 'd have had to scrap the Pearl 1 1/2 years ago .
5 #### If your tired of hearing you trailer receiver after every bump in the round . This product totally solved that issue for me . Made my receiver very secure and quite . Very satisfied .
4 #### It 's been a while , my wife is using this backup battery , she uses it mainly to recharge her iphone . It does what it says , and it 's easy to use .
3 #### Be forewarned : This microphone has an extreme amount of transparency . So much so that I found it pretty unflattering as a mic for recording lead vocals in a musical context . This mic is about as clinically transparent as it gets and tended to thin out vocals . This is NOT a warm sounding mic , as somebody else above stated . It does not flatter or color the source with warmth in any way , shape or form . I actually found the mids to sound a bit scooped with this mic on both vocals and acoustic guitars . I do n't know , not my cup of tea at all . I do hear , however , that it 's a great voice over mic . Time to go poopy ! From what I 'm reading , that is appears to be the market that 's really embracing this mic , as voiceover professionals tend to already tend to have warm vocals to begin with , so they do n't need a mic that colors the source .
2 #### Plug on headphones are not formed correctly and will not plug into phone . I tried to reach the seller , but zero response . Luckily they are cheap in price , but worthless if you can not plug into your phone .
5 #### Cleaned my connections well before applying the goop ( looks like petroleum jelly and might be ) . Slipped the covers on and always have a good connection . Worth the money to me .
5 #### We actually had a previous and similar product but lost it when our iPhone was stolen . Of course , we bought the wrong product ( as this was for an iPod ) , but had to give this a great rating , because the exchange process went so well and the replacement was perfect . Would highly recommend .
5 #### It works . And the spring - loaded retractable cord is great . Sometimes this unit gets a little warm but not so much as to be worrisome .
5 #### Of course , any audio situation is a matter of personal taste -- but -- I suggest anyone try these who wants to hear what headphones can be . They have the best bass -- the purest highs and they are comfortable for listening over a long period . Be aware that these will go very loud -- far more than most -- so be wary when you listen a lot . I have had a pair for around 25 years -- and I have replaced the ear pads -- and they have worked fine always . I paid $ 100 when I bought them -- around $ 210 in today 's dollars . This price is exceptional . I was going to buy another pair -- but saw no need . Professionals use them . I have had many other good ones -- but -- these are in a class by themselves . You will not be disappointed . Another good choice is the Sennheiser HD202 - -my second favorite pair and a bargain . And I hope all of you realize that " ear buds"--are just wrong -- useful only in unusual circumstances .
5 #### Excellent product . I have purchased Netgear Ethernet switches before and prefer this brand to all others . It arrived in two days and works very well .
5 #### I bought buttons and installed them on my student - model classical guitar . The strap looks great , easy to adjust and comfortable .
4 #### This a fantastic wrench you can store this item in the back of your motor .
5 #### This battery has been very strong so far . My old battery was only lasting a few hours . This one has been on without a charge for over a day and still going . Saved me having to buy a new phone .
5 #### I used this 1/4 " hose for an 8,000 BTU catalytic heater . Far better than a large stiff 3/8 " hose and long enough to allow the tank to be outside or back in a corner someplace . It gets 5 stars for being well made and use friendly .
4 #### The Metra wiring harness allows for me to install an aftermarket radio in my Volvo with out any problems . The harness plug into the factory harness and you have to connect the wires from the other end to your aftermarket radio . I installed a double din navigation system and this harness allowed me to install the navigation . Amazon had the cheapest price for the harness I have checked everywhere from best buy to audio stores for this harness .
5 #### Was using the v600s until they discontinued them . At this price point , these are a great substitute and sound very good in the club when I DJ . There 's definitely a break - in period and they sound even better after a few hours of use .
5 #### sorry to see it disco`ed by mfr ... Love the long cord ... hope they make a new model of this soon and will buy again
5 #### I use the Meguiar 's 57 to clean the clear plastic enclosure on the front of my houseboat . I have tried most every product and this works better than any I have tried .
5 #### This is the second such card I 've bought , and I 'm so pleased with it-- the price is unbeatable for something so versatile . You can use it either as a microSDHC card , or as a full - size SDHC card . Considering it costs the same ( or less ) than most other brands that offer either one or the other , why not buy the one that offers both ? I 'm currently using it with the adapter inside my point - and - shoot camera , and it works well and does n't cause big delays between shots . But I also know that if I need to use it in another device that requires a micro card , I can switch it out . It 's a great value , and my other card served me well for many years in another camera before I sold that camera with the memory card in it .
4 #### Use in all my vehicles . Generally put a can in after every oil change .
5 #### Love all OtterBox products . The fact that they protect the item you have from falls and water is amazing . However if you are expecting your phone to be less bulky , do n't count on it . It makes your phone more bulky and that is the price you have to pay for exceptional protection of your phone . This is perfect for the iPhone because it is known for not being very durable and the screen breaks easily . Putting on this case is easy , but taking it of is somewhat of a challenge , but again that is the price you have to pay for exceptional protection .
3 #### These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit .
5 #### ... that 's what you will get when you put these on your vehicle . I have 4 of them on my Jeep and you will absolutely look like a 747 coming in for a landing when you turn these babies on . Just make sure you have a good battery and or alternator as they tend to suck the current . But , it is absolutely brilliant when you light up the night . They were easy to install and wire ( depending on your wiring requirements ) . I had no use for the built in turn signals so I clipped the wires off . If you plan on hooking the turn indicators you 'll need to purchase amber bulbs . The lights come with clear which are not street legal .
4 #### The back is not totally clear , which I thought it was . The back is more like frosted or opaque . I was looking for just a bumper and after not finding a bumper that was not aluminum I decided on the boxwave . For the price it 's the best case out there ... great product for the price and would recommend it .
5 #### Well , depending on the type of music you play , this is the right head for you .. I play Gospel , Fussion and Hip - Hop , these heads have delivered , despite their humble appearance .
5 #### This is a well thought - out case for the droid . The clip on clamshell fits the phone perfectly , leaving all the ports and buttons available , though I suspect this would not be compatable with any of the docking accessories ( I do n't have any ) . It will come off the phone fairly easily but I would n't want to do this every day ( and I suspect the locking tabs would wear or break too quickly ) . The only small comlplaint I have is that one of the locking tabs on the display part of the protector will press a couple of the keys as I open or close the display . I hope this will improve over time , but its not a big problem for me even if it continues . The holster has a nice tight belt clip that holds the phone close to my body so that it is not sticking out to snag on things . The phone fits into the holster with the display inside so that everything except the ports on the phone are covered and protected . The display can not accidently slide open while in the holster . So , on my belt I feel the phone is well protected against normal dings and the headphone port and volume control are easily accesible if I want to listen to music or talk on a headset . I had the BodyGlove OEM case and returned it because it did not provide nearly the protection I wanted from a carrying case . This case is much better .
5 #### This product will restore clear plastic to like new ... when the discoloring is a surface problem ... not when it is due to the plastic itself discoloring internally i.e. cheap non UV stable plastics . Always seal with Meguiar 's polish .
4 #### I purchased this case as a spare case because the one I originally ordered was going to take a while to get to me . I use this case for my phone during work days , I work maintenance for a high school . It is a nice sturdy case which fits into my cell pouch on my belt . The only issue I have with it is that when I take it off to clean it the areas I touch the back of the case will not come clean . I have use cleaner on the case and even sent it through the dishwasher on the low heat cycle . The areas are still dirty , oh well it is for work so I should expect it to get dirty .
4 #### Have owned this phone for two years . Having read the reviews I wonder if I got the best one ! Holds a charge great , sound quality is great , love the FM radio feature at work . It just keeps delivering but I only use it as a no frills phone . The finish has taken a beating and still looks new . I would recommend it to anyone looking for a inexpensive cell phone . If you want a smart phone this ai n't it .
1 #### This is a piece of junk . This is a waste of money . This is not worth buying . Look elsewhere . Junk .
2 #### Bought my first of these in Feb 2013 and it is now being held together with electrical tape . Did n't expect much from the reviews but they 're so inexpensive that I gave it a try anyway . This time I ordered several and will just consider them a disposable item although they work fine with the electrical tape .
5 #### I purchased this cable as a replacement for my stock Samsung Galaxy S2 ( Epic 4 G Touch ) because the stock cable was so weak at the connection end . This BlackBerry cable works perfectly and has a much better fit to the phone . If feels more solid when plugged in to the phone and performs without any problems when transferring files to my PC . Ca n't beat the price either !
5 #### Footings a tad small for my liking but ... The safety pins are a good idea and make up for the aforementioned .
5 #### I AM IMPRESSED ! I finally decided to take the DVD plunge , so I looked online and decided on the Toshiba 1600 based on the glowing reviews it had received . Trust me , the reviews are accurate ! This player is rock - solid , has all the features an entry level DVD enthusiast could hope for , and plays every movie you put in . After talking to some friends who had players that would n't play certain movies ( The Matrix , The X - Men , Tarzan ) , I was relieved that mine plays every disc I 've tried . One side note : When I originally purchased this player , it was defective ( due to shipping damage ) . But Amazon.com took great care of me , shipped me a new one , and even checked it before they sent it to me . So , five stars for the player , and 5 stars for Amazon.com 's customer service !
4 #### Amazon had the best price on the Epi Jumbo case , but the packing was non existent , as the case was just thrown in a box , so it ended up with one dime size ding on an edge . I guess I am lucky it was not worse . This is the standard build Epi hard case , and I have over 20 to attest to this fact . The case holds a new EJ200CE I got , and it fits like a glove . Checked gig bags , and they were actually more expensive than this hard case .
5 #### These things work just fine . And they 're not too expensive .
4 #### Did n't come with clips so be careful removing old ones .
2 #### Would not stay plugged in to the back of my Taylor , and could n't figure out why . Just could not get a secure plug in connection .
5 #### There are better cases on the market , but I could n't find one close to the price of this one . Holds the PC snuggly , and there is lots of gadget space . Great deal .
2 #### I bought a set of these to try to learn some fingerpicking techniques , but I have to say I had a bear of a time trying to get them to fit properly , and they felt tight and uncomfortable on my fingers , even though my hands are pretty small . It was a cool idea , but they should have made them out of a softer plastic where they fit around your fingers , and harder where the striking surface is .
5 #### Very happy with it I bought this for my Garmin GPS it does what it should without any problems great price to
5 #### This is the 2nd bluetooth speakerphone that I 've purchased for my car , after also owning 4 bluetooth headsets . The headsets do n't work for me . I previously owned a Parrot Minikit , which worked reasonably well for over 3 years , then suddenly died -- although it was working , sound could be neither transmitted or heard through it 's speaker . I purchased this unit after reading consistently positive reviews , and got a killer price for an open box unit . Here 's my thoughts : the sound quality is better than the Parrot on both ends . The Parrot has better volume with the built - in speaker , but using the T505 over my car stereo is totally awesome . The battery life seems to be pretty good . I 'm going right now on my 2nd week without a charge using it daily . Pairing is easy . The auto - pairing when powered off and on works quickly and without a hitch . The text - to - speech voice dialing , which is really a function of the phone not the T505 , is OK ( I 'm using an LG Env2 ) . I usually dial out on the phone , and receive calls using the T505 . The control layout is pretty good , and the indicator lights are actually useful . The manual is surprisingly well written . All in all , I am pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality speakerphone for the car .
5 #### I have a Kenwood DDX6019 unit with GPS . I wanted to be able to play music from my phone ( Samsung Galaxy SII ) and originally had one of those crappy FM transmitter units . I bought this after researching and fretting . The sound quality is suburb . I now listen to my audio ( books and music ) as well as my phone calls through the included microphone . My only comment on the phone calls is that my callers notice a slight echo when speaking . Not sure if there 's anything that can be done . Thumbs up !
5 #### I love cheap imitations that work . This is not the cheap imitation ........ and it shines ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Works like a charm for my printer and I have n't had any problems with it .
3 #### Flimsy . Other wise 4 1/2 stars . Sound depends on device and app as much as phones . Return policy generous but you will return again and again . Buy the extra ear pads !
5 #### Been playing 50 years ... getting where I hate to change strings . These sound fantastic , as good ans any I 've ever played , plus they last a really long time . The coating is very thin , ca n't hardly tell it 's there . I like these much better than the big name coated strings as the coating does n't get in the way of the tone . Also use the electric version . Wish they made a set for my electric 12 string !
5 #### I bought this cable for length and I was surprised by its flexibility . As of yet I have no problems with the cable ; and I have maxed out the Firewire 800 port 's capacity . Worth the price , and I am well satisfied .
4 #### I bought this to manage some cables in different locations , I was hoping it was wider than it actually is . You can only put 1 cable inside of it . It worked terrifically to manage the power cable from a wall mounted tv . I was hoping to use it put 3 ethernet cables inside but it 's just not large enough . They make a larger version that is for that purpose .
5 #### This thing looks like it could survive an apocalypse . It 's heavy and burly , but not too expensive . I expect I 'll keep it forever , since having a hood crush your fingers or head is just not worth it .
4 #### The cut outs are n't exactly perfect , but they do n't block anything and overall fits very well . The case smells really bad , but I just got it today so hopefully it will wear off . It fits much better than the previous silicone case I had and does n't slip off when I put it in my pocket or purse . I do n't really like the shade of green and will probably try to get it in purple . It 's a little slippery as well , but hoping that will get better with time too .
5 #### In the past twenty years I 've purchased thousands of dollars worth of A / V and PC equipment . At $ 399 plus $ 10 per month for the programming , TiVo is my favorite . OK , if I want to spend hours every week programming my VCR ( of which I own five ) , I can record all my favorite shows , but why bother when TiVO does a much better job virtually automatically . Since I purchased Tivo in April , I have n't recorded anything on the VCR 's . I still use them occasionally to play a rental movie not available on DVD . For those of you that may complain about the $ 10 / month ( or $ 200 one time ) charge for the programming data service , I would suggest that this is a minor cost compared to what you are probably paying for cable or direct tv , AND I would submit that the TiVo service will greatly enhance your ability to utilize and manage the 50 to 250 channels that are available with cable or satellite . Do I watch alot more TV than I did before ? Not really , but now I always have something to watch that I 'm interested in rather than just watching what happens to be currently broadcasted . Did I consider Replay ? Yes , also a nice product , but for my needs TiVO is better . Will the price drop by Christmas ? Probably , but at $ 399 why wait ? Enjoy it today .
5 #### If your expectations are reasonable , you 're going to love this little baby ! It arrived from the online store already tuned . The gigbag was a pleasant surprise ; no skimping on quality there . The strings were of medium gauge , and it was NOT setup well at the Martin factory , as some have stated . But the sound , even with factory strings , was wonderful . The projection of the strings was as perfect as a baby Martin could be with sub - par strings . It beats hell out of my tinny - sounding Peavey parlour guitar . It 's a very good - looking guitar , in an understated sort of way . There was not a mark on it . It was , in a word , perfect . I will be using this guitar for finger - picking songs only , as my other guitars take on other duties . After a change of strings to Martin lights , I 'm sure I can coax an even better sound out of her . Even as an experienced player , I had to down - tune the guitar so I could place a capo at the first fret for standard tuning . I 'll have to get this girl setup ; but will be later . I would recommend this guitar to anyone -- beginner or expert , as long as you do n't beefy hands . Just make sure you realize you may not get a perfectly setup guitar as others have .
5 #### I have gigged with these for a couple of years and have not had one problem . I have one in my pedal case and one for my amp .
5 #### Bought Belkin USB Extension cable ( 10 - feet ) and Sabrent USB to Parallel IEEE 1284 printer cable . Needed both to hook up HP Laserjet 1320 to my newer computer which did not have a parallel port and was further than six feet . Together they worked fine -- hooked up and Windows 7 installed drivers for USB connection and printer driver .
5 #### one floor down and 6 more to go This is by far the best floor wax ever and it has stood the test of time and I have used the brand for over 40 years now and have never been let down or unhappy with the product
5 #### I wanted something fun and girly for my phone . And this was exactly what I was looking for . I have gotten many compliments !
5 #### These are really great picks . I have always had a problem hanging on to the traditional tear shaped pick . These give me something to hang on to . Have definitely helped my playing .
4 #### Just purchased this and like the small size and clip on and total portability . also like that you can monitor the sound coming into the camcorder . Sound quality is excellent when there is no competing sounds and is within 40 feet . Saw another product for 1/3 as much but required to be plugged in to work ( the main system not the clip on which was on battery power ) . My biggest complaint is that it tends to fade at about 60 feet away . I was hoping for the signal to be a bit stronger till about 100 feet . It 's not professional quality but selection at this price was slim . Recommend it ? Yes , for a short range interview or public speaking use .
3 #### I wanted to carry only one pocket device and chose this unit because it is 1 : palm based ( i 've had a clie for 5 years ) and 2 : Because it 's an unlocked phone meaning I 'm not married to phone service . So far so good . There are few glitches with this phone though . The first and most frustrating problem is it has no Bluetooth activated voice dialing . What gives ? Every BT phone out there has voice dialing and this " state of the art ? " devise does not ? Another problem is that there is a propriatory sync and charge connection instead of using a standard USB mini . Because of the third problem ( lousy battery life ) it means you 're stuck buying a cradle for home a cradle for work and a car charger in order to get a full days use . Pros : Palm . Easy , reliable , highly useful pda . Phone . Seems to have better than average voice and reception . Cons Bluetooth . You can not voice dial with BT . ( Hoping someone will come out with software soon ) Propietary Charge / Sync . You have to spend about an extra $ 120 to get a full days use , instead of just plugging it into a computer .
4 #### I 've had the DT-200V ( or its predecessor ) for years and have been happy with its excellent FM reception and useful interface ( lock switch , auto power off , easily accessible volume control ) . It has survived many drops . The DT-300 - VW has the same ergonomic features , is smaller ( but not much lighter ) , and adds a clock and weather radio reception . The shutoff timer is 90 minutes instead of an hour , which I like , and the presets are much more convenient than the 200V. My only quibble : no belt clip . I like that it uses AAA instead of AA batteries , since I always have spares for my palm pilot and noise cancelling headphones . I have n't tested the earbuds that came with it -- I'll probably throw them away .
1 #### The rest works about as you 'd expect , but the pin puller is a terrible design . It only fits the pins on about half of my guitars , and provides Zero leverage . I have no idea why they changed the design from having the peg puller be part of the winder , but it 's a serious fail . You 'd be better off getting a $ 2 Dunlop 100SI winder / peg puller , and a small set of wire cutters . I have a couple with the old design , and really hate to see a great product ruined . This is going in the trash .
5 #### This is a useful book for those new to Apple laptops but it also has handy hints for those who have used Macs for a long time but never took the time to learn many of the features . That brings up one of the strong points about Macs -- they are so easy to use that you do n't need to spend much time educating yourself on how to use them . Consequently it is easy to be unfamiliar with useful shortcuts and tools and even some of the fun features . I found the layout and colors to be pleasant and practical . The size of the book seems about right , covers are nice , and paper quality seems very good . The illustrations are clear and attractive although some of the screen shots are too small . Overall , I found " My Macbook " to be superior to many computer handbooks in readability , content and appearance . Of course , it wo n't tell you everything you might possible need to know but it gives a comprehensive foundation and you can also find answers to more advanced questions on the Web .
5 #### I bought this just because I am a geek and love new things and I have this hooked into my TV so I can watch movies / shows at night and it works great .
5 #### Very happy with these bumpers . Nice and flexible enough to protect our car doors . Bought one , tried it and am now ordering three more for the back door of one side of the garage and two for the side .
5 #### Cleans really well and gets rid of squeaks instantly ! I see mechanics using this thing last time but not the 3 M name brand . This one is just better . It sprays really powerfully so keep a good distance when you spray to avoid splashes .
5 #### I got this as a stocking stuffer for my musician husband , and he thought it was a pretty nifty idea . Now when he plays shows or is practicing and drops a pic , he does nt need to fiddle around to find another one . He stuck it right to his strap .
4 #### It is not as good as a regular mounted CB but it has a lot of pros such as mobility . I use this for communicating with other Jeeps on trails and it is great for that purpose .
4 #### The phone is an excellent phone and all the features work . I have owned four previous to this one . Two were U.S. versions and two foreign versions . The reason I ordered this phone is because U.S. Versions had a few features that the foreign versions did n't and U.S. English was used . This phone is not a U.S. version . It says Chine Mobile on the back and uses British English . So , the advertising is incorrect .
5 #### The picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package . All 12 picks were there . Saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car . They feel good in my hand while strumming the strings . Good deal and I will purchase again .
5 #### It was easy to install and use . It even included the software and a adapter for a small computer case . It got me back on line fast .
5 #### Great fix for a noisy hitch . I transport horses and the hitch noise used to sound like the trailer was going to fall off . This is a simple fix that goes on in 5 minutes and works great . It also adds a 2nd level of security to keeping the hitch on the vehicle .
5 #### What a wonderful pair of binoculars ! The binocular market is saturated with a plethora of cheap binoculars , and all too often their cheapness nags at you while using them . However , this pair is really special . For so little money , you get an extremely - accurate pair of binoculars that have great focusing ability and commendable optics . When looking at the specs , however , it is hard to tell how much you will enjoy using them - but after using this frequently for astronomy , bird - watching , and general fun , I have found these to be wonderfully comfortable to hold , easy on the eyes and nose , and not too heavy and not too light ( too light is n't a good thing - you ca n't stabilize them ) . Highly recommended !
5 #### if you want a metal sim card tray eject pin , and not use a paperclip , then this pin is what you want . bought this pin from amazon third - party marketplace seller Crazy - Store for fifty - five cents . that seller was based in Hong Kong and so had to wait a little longer for the sim card tray pin . me was n't in a big hurry , but wanted this type of pin for my iPhone instead of always using a paperclip as a substitute . if you lost your sim card tray pin , then get one of these for yourself if you do n't want to use a paperclip .
5 #### I bought the 12x25 & it is very nice ! Small & powerful ! I like that it has an attached neck strap , even if it is just a thin cord . It also comes with a canvas carrying case , with a velcro closure . I 've been using it to view backyard birds & it is great for that & the adjustable focus works well . I could make out a car 's license plate number from over 100yards away . I think these would also be excellent for concerts & sporting events . Next time I will go , I will take with & update my review .
5 #### Works great . I noticed it did n't come with the clips , ask your mechanic to put metal clips on . The plastic ones that come with my previous filter ( FRAM ) are not recommended to be reused .
2 #### was expecting more for the money . one of the connectors cracked at the base the first time i disconnected it from the wall
5 #### This product is exactly as described and does a great job , it is very easy to use
4 #### Looks cool , but hard to see when it lights while your are driving . Comes on when brakes are pressed and being in the driver seat I just ca n't crane my neck that far . Cheap plastic feel .... hope it lasts a while .
5 #### This is a standard cable and does exactly what it is supposed to do . I am happy with the purchase .
2 #### This was great for the first 2 months . Month 3 , it started dropping calls . By month 4 , it was dropping more calls than it was answering . I replaced it with another bluetooth , because I could n't take it anymore . I would n't recommend this . I now have the Samsung WEP and after a few weeks , no problems as of yet .
3 #### This bondo is too soft when it dries out . Not sure what i m doing wrong .
5 #### When I went to the local Sprint store , they informed me that there were no iGo tips available for the Pre . The Palm Pre takes a MicroUSB connector , but more importantly needs a fast charger ... This connecter is MicroUSB connector and appears to be wired so that it supports the quick charge . So when I found out that the Kindle 2 tip was a MicroUSB tip , I decided to give it a try . I could n't be happier ! ! ! * Note : I do n't know if this is a function of the iGo Charger or the tip , but the combo charges the phone just as quickly as the normal Palm Pre charger .
5 #### Took nearly four weeks to receive ... but the company in China was upfront saying that in its ad . Am very satisfied with these pens and the price was great . If you order these ... be patient on delivery time . I bought these as backups ... but I am using them as the primary pens ... they are that good .
2 #### The connector fits the Ford Excursion OEM wiring , but it was missing some of the pins ( wires ) needed . If you buy a 16 pin harness , it should have 16 wires , whether you use them or not ! Re - bought from a different vendor.(Absolute USA H598/1771 Radio Wiring Harness ) , that harness was only missing 1 .
1 #### Item arrived cracked at the hinge so I sent it back and went on using my otterbox . I have a pelican backpack no problem with that this seemed to have just been a bad seller .
5 #### I like all of the Dunlop Stubby Picks . I use this 1.00 Pick when playing on lighter gauge strings and it produces a bright , light sound .
5 #### Easy to install . I use the Rolls to connect a turntable to my computer then airplay the audio to the rest of my house . Great for non - audiofiles .
5 #### I bought this to connect my Midi Pro adapter ( for use with xbox 360 ) to my Roland TD-20 . I do n't know how to rate it , other than it costs $ 7 and it works . I 'd pay that again if i ever needed a replacement . It does n't appear to be cheaply made , and i feel it will last forever , so long as i 'm not constantly walking on it while it 's on a hardwood floor
2 #### I bought this and my husband bought the same for his EnV. They both fell apart inside of a month . The screw that holds the clip to the phone endlessly comes lose , causing the phone to fall right off . The only reason I gave it any stars is that the case is strong enough that the phones did n't break the many times they fell out . I think we have the answer to the above review asking how long the case will last ......
5 #### The dvd drive in my Macbook Pro ( unibody ) stopped working completely . I took it to the Apple store and for $ 120 they were going to change it for a new one . I wanted to do some research online before committing to paying that . I went on some blogs and someone suggested trying to clean it first . SO ... I bought this cleaning CD and voila ! ! ! My dvd drive works perfectly once again ! ! ! I saved about $ 118 ! ! ! ! Pretty good ! !
5 #### I decided to go with an ethernet home network because of its speed and secutity . I had a cable running through the attic to another room where I had a computer attached to the network . I needed to add another computer in that room to the single cable and was not sure how best to proceed . After doing some research on the web , which included learning the difference between a hub and a switch ; I discovered the switch should do the job I needed done . I plugged the ethernet cable from the router into port one , and a desktop into port 2 and the laptop into port 3 . It all connected and worked properly once I had set up the laptop to connect to the network . It is now working perfectly and the switch is invisible to the network , but is quietly doing its job . I am using the Linksys router and switch and they are doing the job I needed done . I am completely satisfied with the product .
5 #### Ukulele sounds better now that I replaced the 5 year old strings , sadly it did not make me a better player .
3 #### had to change them all the time gets to many scarchs in the protector works good new but only lasts for about 1 mounth for me but i m hard on phones
4 #### I got this cover for 6 yr old son 's tablet . It worked so good . Which was a surprise because I got the same cover for my daughter but n purple & it did not last . So I guess buy the black one it will protect better .
4 #### What impressed me the most was ability to shoot the Moon ) ) ) Cooool ) ) ) Use of a tripod is pretty much mandatory with full zoom
5 #### Item received exactly as posted . Very well made cord with good length , and reliable charging . One of my co - workers stated that they would be purchasing one also , as a backup .
4 #### These pens work great if you have big fingers like mine ... Although , they seem to dissappear everytime I need one ... And when I do n't need one , they are sitting in the most obvious places staring right at me ... I think if they came with a homing devise and or an APP for your cell phone to locate one , that would make them great products and must haves ...
5 #### My daughter tried driving her " new " 92 Dodge pickup at night and could only really see the road with high beams . The old sealed - beam bulbs just are n't up to today 's standards of brightness . We initially looked at adding fog / driving lights , but then found out that they 're pretty much illegal all the time here in Oregon . So with a bit of research , we found these replacements for the sealed beams . These made an amazing difference in the color and quality of the beam . No problem with night driving now . It 's almost as good as our newer vehicles . It 's easy to see how the sealed beam manufacturers would not spend much time getting the reflector perfect , since it 's a disposable unit . But Hella did a fine job on these . Daughter did the install herself , so I ca n't comment on that . But she did n't complain of any problems .
5 #### Fat spanky nashville tones reminiscent of the finest Jerry Reed/ Buck Owen Hee Haw era guitar riffage . I 'm kicking myself in the butt for not buying this years ago . Compression is a highly underrated effect . I find that my dynacomp is engaged more than any other pedal on my board . It 's not just what it adds to my tone , it 's also what it adds to the feel .
4 #### do n't have much use for it as I do n't play slide guitar . bought it in hopes of learning free bird but gave up . decent slide nothing fancy .
1 #### The package came damaged with part of the string poking through the plastic . Not only that , but the paper holding the strings appeared to be wet and the entire package must have been under something very heavy as there are deep imprints into the paper . To top it off , the strings are bent so I ca n't even use it . I 've bought many strings off Amazon and this is the first time I 've had this problem . I 'll provide some photo evidence .
5 #### works good for the price .... would be perfect for small room ...
3 #### Seams a bit flimsy but might be a enough to stop someone to not mess with it . Had to drill it to fit over studs but not much of a problem .
5 #### Super cheap investment for your vehicle 's safety . With lots of connections , I can tell you I do n't know a single police officer who has ever known of a car stolen with a Club in use .
5 #### I mistakenly bought this harness . In terms of the quality of the item I received , it was spot on . Strong and simple . Beware that you should definitely check the back of your factory radio first . I believe this will fit Mk2 's , Mk3 's and early Mk4 's . If you have a double din Monsoon deck , you need a metra harness from crutchfield .
5 #### What a perfect item . Simple , beautiful and perfectly designed . So I bought two . I needed something to hold a 20inch K Custom ride . Picture is from my practice kit showing an 18 " ride , but as people are saying , this thing could hold a 24 " heavy ride . It 's that sturdy . The bottom clamp is a monster . You can see this in the picture . Saves me from carrying and lugging around another stand . LOVE THIS ! ! !
5 #### The best strings I 've found so far for my custom Michael Bashkin OM size acoustic guitar . Excellent tone , long lasting . I 've already purchased a second set but have n't needed to change my strings yet .
5 #### This radio is easy to use , and sounds great . Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good . You also get sideband tuning , which you 'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators . Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to . With the supplied aux . antenna , reception is noticably improved . It comes with ear - bud headphones , AC adapter and the aux antenna . It also has AM and FM reception . FM is stereo with the headphones , and is very good quality . It has 2 built in clocks ( believe me , you WANT that ! ! ) 40 memories , and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling . This could be considered an entry level radio , but it is sensetive enough that you wo n't " out grow " it for a very long time .
2 #### I have had the w580i for 1 year , 2 months now and I have enjoyed using the phone and most of its features . However , during that time I have experienced several quality issues . One of them ( the ear speaker died ) was probably isolated to my unit . But I also had my keypad crack twice . The cracked keypad seems to be a common issue with this model , just search online about it . I had to send in the phone twice for warranty repairs . Now , the left soft keys ( select / back ) have stopped working . Another search revealed this to also be a common flaw also . My warranty has run out , so Sony Ericsson will not fix this . Fortunately , there is a workaround by pushing hard on the area between the navigation keys and the LCD screen ( where there is either the ' W ' logo or the at&t logo ) , then the keys will work . The bottom line though is that this phone has some serious quality flaws and therefore I do not recommend purchasing this model anymore . I give it 2 - stars since the phone is still a very nice slider design with excellent software / interface .
5 #### This is a great case for my daughters oboe . We had one for 4 years and the bag looks like new but the zippers were shot so bought another . It has a great front pocket that holds all of her sheet music and extra reeds .
5 #### 12 lifetimes supply of air filter oil . The cost of small amounts of air filter oil is $ 10 to $ 15 . This 5 gallon will be over - kill . Maybe I can sell in small batches . Makes it easier to replace more frequently . I have 2 vehicles so it will be spread out .
5 #### It does its job connecting a Macbook pro to a Sony camcorder . I have not had any issues with connectivity - it just works every time !
5 #### It does what it says . It puts black characters onto a 1/2 " wide piece of white tape , using the Brother label maker . Comes in a convenient cartridge you can swap out rather than having to wind the tape onto a different spool . Probably wo n't save the universe , but will allow you to label the various buttons on your star fighter .
5 #### I like the fact that its not too big and that it fits great in the guitar hole but I have n't actually used it yet but will need to soon so I will update later to let you know what I really think .
5 #### These headphones really are fantastic . They have excellent sound quality , they are very comfortable to wear and I greatly prefer them to ear buds , which I can never get to fit right .
5 #### Not everyone prefers celluloid picks , but I like them . decent price
1 #### I have used many Plantronics headsets , and they are usually great . This one quit working after one week , and the seller would not respond to my emails . Amazon made good on it for me , but I ended up replacing it at Radio Shack .
5 #### Excellent purchase . Efficient delivery , here before I knew it . Not one complaint from this consumer .
4 #### Not bad guitar care kit . A little over priced but does the trick .
5 #### Note : I play on a seagull coastline spruce ( shorter scale , thus lower string tension ) Pros : -lasts a long time -smooth feel , a bit slicker than the exps , but not enough to affect play ( I do have dry hands though , so coated strings seem to suit me better than people with sweaty hands ) -nice and balanced without the overly bright and jangly tone that new strings tend to have ( even compared to other coated strings like daddario exps ) -all of the strings are coated -string noise is minimized -strumming / fingerpicking is easier Cons : -for people who want a bit more grip on their strings , you may prefer different strings ( i.e. If you 're someone who likes to bend a lot , these may not be for you ) -for people who do like the bright and jangly tone that comes with new strings , you may not like these strings as they may sound " muffled " in comparison ( even when brand new ) -they're a bit more stiff when brand new in comparison to other strings . A good stretch and some playing does appear to resolve this .
5 #### Forget all the new designer headphones , and get these old model ones that have tremendous bass . I 'm so glad amazon still offers them .
5 #### Had this product for a long time . Still works after taking some beating . My camera does n't work anymore but the cord works fine .
5 #### This is the cleaner you get in the k an n cleaning and oiling kit but a much bigger size . It lasts a long time and is a good price . I will buy it again .
5 #### It works as a good extender . I 've had no problems with it and it is fully functional . If you need an extension cable this one works well
5 #### Best oil on the market . Love it for all my 2 cycle engines .
5 #### After using the Plantronics Voyager 520 for a year , I am now buying one for my mother and son for Christmas . It sits on my ear very comfortably and does n't fall off easily like a smaller one I had . Phone calls are very clear and people I talk to say they hear me clearly . Having this bluetooth is so convenient that I use it when I do n't want to hold a phone to my ear such as driving , shopping , exercising , and yardwork . I also use it at the office so I can work and talk at the same time and not hold on to a phone .
4 #### This is a nice , handy adapter that has given me several months of good service ( and still going strong . ) Do n't be fooled into buying a lesser / cheaper model that might break after a few weeks . I only wish the lanyard was a little longer . Also , I slightly prefer the kind that has a few inches of cable in between the tips rather than a monolithic pod .
3 #### The description says that there are no risk of the case breaking open when you drop the phone ... um , false . The first time it dropped , it not only fell apart , but my phone also scraped . Sad . So I have since stopped using it and currently using the rubber one I purchased at the same time . It 's such a pretty design though ...
5 #### This keychain is the bombdigity with chocolate sauce ! I can not tell you how many times I have backed up to a trailer to figure out if my lights will work only to find that they are broken . This is also quite helpful when you are diagnosing the system as there are no long trailer wires to get damaged just the harness inside your car .
4 #### My first CB radio . Works flawlessly . Plenty loud to hear at about 50 mph . Have n't tested it at higher speeds as yet though .
4 #### Easy install , wipes clean ! UPDATE 12/22/15 : Dropping from five to four stars . These blades started heavily streaking after six months .
4 #### This network switch from Netgear has a small footprint and is easy to hook and use . I 'm using this in my home theater to connect several internet capable devices to the single ethernet drop I have in that location and the switch has been working flawlessly for that purpose .
3 #### I paid upper 70s on sale a couple of months ago . I think it 's 10 to 15 less now . They 're worth $ 70 so if they 've dropped in price then they 're definitely worth it . Sound is good for digital stereo , but wo n't compare to a surround sound headphone . If all you need is stereo you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### I love these strings . They sound awesome on my Eastman E10D. Have n't tried the medium elixer strings on it , but I prefer the exp16 to the light elixers .
5 #### I bought this for my pottery studio since the walls are thick and people do not get very good cell phone service inside . It has increased the number of bars I am getting ! It took my husband about an hour and a half to set it up but almost all of that time was spent stringing the cord through my ceiling tiles . Installation : There are three recommended ways to install the " outside " antenna : ( 1 ) inside of a window ( there are suction cups ) , ( 2 ) attached to a pole , ideally on the roof , and ( 3 ) attached to the building 's rafters . It comes with detailed instructions , but there are a few things that are worth knowing about before you purchase . The " outside " antenna needs to be connected , via a cord ( included in 20 ft and 30 ft lengths that can be connected for a 50 ft length , if needed ) to the DT , which needs to be connected to the " inside " antenna , which needs to be plugged in to a surge protector . The " outside " antenna needs to be at least 20 ft away from the DT , and the inside antenna needs to be at least 18 inches from the DT .
5 #### I 've purchased more than a few of these . They all worked flawlessly on my iPhone 4 . They charge up quick , quality products and durable . I 've traveled with them everywhere .
5 #### Capo puts enough presser on strings .... well made and easily adjustable
4 #### I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing . The reeds are fairly consistent , and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds ( teacher , student , school , parent ... ) . The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed , as long as they are not pushed in too far . I usually move students to Rico Royal or Vandoran after their first full year or two . Amazon does have excellent prices on reeds - definitely recommend buying here !
5 #### Exactly as specified , k&n filter oil spray in a large can for a great price . Prices on Amazon fluctuate so always do your own cost comparisons .
5 #### Simple and straightforward . Great product for anything that has a Kensington lock hole .
5 #### Excellent lightweight over - the - ear headphone with a great bass and tremble range . I used them right out of the box with my iPod and they sounded so much better than the earbuds that came with the iPod . Bass was crisp and clear with no distortion and the highs were also crisp and pleasant to the ear . The headphones are adjustable ( both for fit and firmness next to the ear ) and very comfortable if you wear them for long periods of time . They also fold - up for easy fit in the included soft carry case . All in all a great set of headphones for the price and they are not bad - looking either . These are not noise - canceling headphones , so you can also hear if the phone rings while you are in the house or car horns if you are jogging outside .
3 #### This screen protector did its job and protected my phone , and having a mirror on the front of my phone was pretty cool , but in some lighting and at some angles it was hard to see through the screen protector and see what was actually on my screen .
4 #### You could get a cheaper one ... Put custom connectors on .
5 #### Pretty straight forward just what i was looking for . Works as advertised pretty hard to mess up this one .
5 #### Norms excellent to look at your photo in a hdmi large screen tv .. Very pleased with the cable
2 #### Did not fit my old LG INCITE , I was trying to charge it to get old photos off of it , not even remotely close > The upside is that I did get a refund for the charge .
2 #### I lost my Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case and saw this one available , so I figured I 'd give it a shot since it 's so cheap and well rated . I 'm not sure if people just have n't seen better cases or what , but based on the design of this one , I just do n't see how it would protect the glass if and when the phone fell and landed screen down . There 's virtually no extra material above the glass to cushion it during a fall . It also fits loosely on the sides and my charger often does n't make contact with the phone because the opening in the rubber is a tad too small . I often have to peel up the rubber and kind of squish the charger through to make sure it makes contact . I 'm probably going to toss this one and re - order the Amzer .
5 #### I got the 16x32 version of these binoculars for bird watching and wow are they powerful . And you ca n't beat the value of $ 40 for a compact , powerful binocular . I was using a much cheaper brand which would not focus that well . But the optics on these Bushnell 's are so much better . Highly recommended for bird watching !
5 #### I bought 2 of these hooks to hand my broom and dustpan on and they are perfect . They are very strong and could hold alot more weight than what I used them for !
3 #### It took a bit to get it hooked up and takes up allot of space but I got it going . Really not that big of a booster tho . I 'm going to try to move it to another place to see what happens .
2 #### Another DOA . Bought this for a last minute trail ride . Came in dead . I think the speaker in the handset was busted , because it would work when I had a headset plugged in . Returned .
5 #### I read reviews for this product to protect my older convertible and will continue to use as long as I own my car . Continue to use over and over !
4 #### This type of capo ( spring ) is great for temporary use , or if you are playing a couple of frets away from the capo location . If you plan on playing closer to the capo , I would recommend the thumb screw type ( Paige P6E or NS type ) that does not take up so much room , and hinder finger placement .
5 #### Use two of these on my dual remote filter setup for my 4.7L dodge . Oil stays clean and I tripled the capacity of the recommended filter
1 #### Nothing at all like the original I owned in the mid 80s . Its more complicated and does nt have as many options . I found a older version on ebay . But I chose to but new for the same price . Now the ebay unit has been sold .
1 #### As many of you know internet phone purchases are NOT the way to go . This is an inferior phone with tons of issues . Do n't buy , it 's not worth half of what they charge and has n't worked properly since the day I had it activated . I was definitely ripped off , but now you know/
4 #### These are solid , heavy , well built cables . I noticed I was able to charge my battery quicker with these . I use the battery in my running car to charge a deep cycle battery while camping and these seemed to transfer more energy , or maybe it is just the strong connections .... either way they work . I might try going down one more gauge to see how well they work . But no complaints .
4 #### Seems like a decent quality strap overall and I like the Celtic design . My only issue with it is that it is Large / Long ... I am 5'11 " and 185lbs ... reasonably broad shoulders and I had to really shorten it up to get to a comfy position for my acoustic guitar . But that was easy to do and it is comfortable ... but just a lot of " slack " to let out should I hit a mid life growth spurt .
4 #### My sunglasses needed a case to carry , this one was perfect , hard and nice looking one !
4 #### One size fits all , there is an adjustment cord on the back so you can pull in any slack you may have . The graphics are nice and the material appears to be high quality .
5 #### OK , so these Headphones look 80 's retro and people may make fun of you because they think they are cool sporting their Beats headphones ( which by the way are highly overrated and just trendy in my opinion ) . However these little gems are lightweight , comfortable to wear for extended times and sound really good ! These Bass response is really good for this type of headphone . I bring these with me on trips and plug them into my phone that I have loaded up with music . I do n't really care what others think when I 'm wearing them because I 'm not about looks , I 'm about sound quality and these headphones have a lot for their price point .
5 #### Use this for 5th wheel towing , I installed on my 2014 F-250 . I can increase or decrease the lift pressure from the cab of the truck , so I 'm no longer bound to geting out the air compressor each time I hook up the 5th wheel . Similarly I can readjust back to normal ride pressure with the press of a button . Great product Easy to install just about 30 min on an F-250
5 #### This also was a good product . It fit perfectly and was able to continue to use the phone . I would recomend this to others .
4 #### It is an actual BlackBerry branded holster - ( I ordered via Amazon seller MyNetDeals ) . Fits the phone well . I 'm hopping that the clip lasts ; The holster my 8800 came with only lasted 3 weeks . I think rubber coated steal might have been a better choice vs the plastic clip ( seen a lot of people complain about them snapping )
5 #### Purchased this to apply Kroil penetrating oil to the upper studs of the front shock absorbers on my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Islander in hopes of loosening the nuts which were severely corroded onto the threaded shock studs . This pump oiler has excellent pumping action and volume dispensing of lubricant which is what I was after . It really gets the job done as moving liquids go . And it is well made with quality sweat brazing on the inner workings of the pump which are quite evident . The external handle and pump lever are strong and you can feel the force of the pump working to move the solvent or oil you are desiring to apply to whatever . This is extremely well made , offering many years of reliable service to whatever you use it for . I highly recommend ! ! ! !
5 #### I have been playing for 25 years and using only this pick and gauge since they started making them . If their good enough for EV then their good enough for you and me . You will never break one but you will lose most of them . lol
3 #### For four years I was a paper carrier . I delivered my newspapers in the morning , between 4:00 and 5:30 AM , back when I was in high school . I always had a portable CD player with me , and used these headphones to listen to music while I delivered . In those four years , I had gone through FOUR pairs of these . I loved their sound , and they were fairly comfortable , but after an hour and a half of wearing them , they did hurt my ears . I still use a pair ( the last pair I bought ) . Be warned , both the 1/8 inch connector and the volume control are easily damaged , making either the left or right earphone , or sometimes both , stop working . I tried to repair them , but found very cheap wiring when I went to splice a new connector onto them , which may explain why they failed so easily . This last pair has held up fairly well , but even now , the connector is failing . Be warned , they 're fragile and can be uncomfortable .
4 #### A lot better than the cheaper ones you find everywhere else . The other ones just leave behind a trail of water , this does nt . This is actually a lot cheaper than in stores ! great price ! After a few months of use , i ve noticed that the performance went down which is why i m giving it 4 stars(still better than the $ 5 walmart brand ) But for $ 10 , its amazing .
1 #### Product design looks nice and appealing . This product seems like made out of plastic bags . It does n't cover or protect any rain or snow . Save money and buy better made .
5 #### HELPFUL PRODUCT . GREAT PURCHASE . FORGET TO CHARGE PHONE SOMETIMES SO THIS PRODUCT REALLY HELPS OUT FROM DAY TO DAY FOR SOMEONE CONSTANTLY ON THE GO
5 #### Hey , I 've had other cheaper trash cymbals , but this is sounds great for the price . Glad I bought it .
5 #### Suits my needs almost perfectly . A great balance of quality construction , design , price and sound . All that and a life time warranty from a company with a solid reputation . I love these headphones .
4 #### Very well made and easy to install . Look great on my 2013 Ford F-150 XLT . The only drawback is the wiring and wiring instructions . The wiring they give you does not have all of the correct connectors for installation but will still work . I am happy with them . Very bright lights .
1 #### Sounds like a great idea , used on both iPhone and Xoom , iPhone one is pretty bad . Scratches easily , scratches wo n't go away , large bubbles leave welt marks when " disappear " . Removed after 2 weeks , not worth it . Good luck anyone getting a replacement for lifetime , company is not reponsive .
5 #### I have played every pick out there since I was 13 - a LONG time ago . Picks are quite simply an obvious matter of preference and I have always loved these .73 mm picks . I really like the versatility of holding the pick " incorrectly " and using the grip portion to play with and create a different tone .
3 #### As expected , excellent price compared to local options . Probably not as long - lasting as more robust cables , but fine for home use .
4 #### The " wet " solution was dried up , but easily replaced with rubbing alcohol . Works as expected and delivered on time .
4 #### I used this under my front bumper because my car is so low , to keep it from scraping the paint . Works perfectly , though I wish that when they had to start a new roll of double stick tape on the backing , they did n't overlap , because now that section sticks up slightly from having two layers for about a mm .
5 #### Like most everyone in the world today , I have a plethora of cables , thumb drives , and power bricks of all sorts , including USB mini and micro , old 30 - pin iDevice cables , lightning cables , two prong power cords , three prong power cords , and specialized data cables ( USB to serial for instance ) . Toss in a portable charger pack and it gets to making a serious mess of electronica . I think this organizer does a decent job of holding a small collection , with mutliple elastic holders for all of them . I am able to get at least one of each cable type listed above , including a multi - port USB brick , which helps to eliminate all the various mains to USB transformers . I can also fit in two Sony power packs for travel . The organizer is about the size of a large book ( think textbook ) , so it will take up some space while travelling , but it holds all the needed cords for my brood . The construction seems OK , although I would expect the elastic to eventually fail ( as all elastic eventually does ) . Some of the cables were a bit tight to get in , but at least they are secure . I was surprised how many things I could pack into it , especially the rather large USB brick . Recommended .
5 #### I ordered these cables for my Wii , when I mounted my flat screen . They work as advertised . I have no problems with them , and I would recommend to anyone . Wo n't disappoint .
4 #### First of all , the battery is well made and heavy ( 7,800mah ) . The extended cover is just okay , does n't offer the water resistance that the factory cover offers and it feels a little cheap ( brittle ) like it will break if dropped . The out protective cover seems okay but does n't feel like it offers much cushion if dropped . The battery arrived at 58 % and it only took about 1 1/4 hrs to top off . If definitely makes the phone feel more substantial . Will update after a couple weeks . Bought this on sale for $ 40 with the much needed accessories , large battery and a two year warranty . UPDATE : My normal battery would only last about 12 hours ( around 20 % remaining ) of my normal use before I had to charge it , this battery has last over 24 hours and is currently at 70 % . So it definitely last longer and looks like it will be able to go for at least another day before charging .
4 #### Does work but still requires a lot of elbow grease . I am still trying to clean some areas . Some areas require scrubbing .
5 #### This fuel line hose is long and hollow in the center . It is appropriately named because it allows FUEL to run through the LINE . It 's suitable for such projects as transferring fuel from a gas tank to an internal combustion engine . Or you could use it to blow in your friend 's ear from another room . The possibilities are endless !
4 #### I made a fishing friend a super minnow keeper with one of these . He lamented replacing D - Cell batteries in his aerator to keep minnows fresh on his pontoon boat . I soldered tiny alligator clips on the wires of this product & set it to 3V. Now he clips it into the aerator as a substitute for batteries .
3 #### I ordered 3 and each cord was a different length . They all seem to work and fit all the different cases I have on my iphone 5 , 6 and ipod touch .
5 #### Great product we looking forward to getting on the road and having every piece needed for the gig . God bless !
5 #### Fair sound , great price , and the collapsed form factor makes them quite transportable . Will update this review in a few months after seeing how they hold up .
5 #### Husband reports that the price / quality were in line and it works just as it should . The case is very useful and keeps it all together for easy access .
5 #### Great Mic ! ! ! Check out my video at [ ... ] DJ Joey K ( Detroit , MI )
5 #### My husband and I each got one of these for our phones and use them instead of cables to transfer photos and ringtones . They work great for that and it 's very convenient to just take the card out of the phone and put it in the adapter then into the sd card slot on our computers and just drag and drop instead of using cables and having one more thing to have to plug into our hubs . So far , I have n't ever used up all the memory on the card . We both use LG phones .
5 #### With aging knees I decided to use this hand rail from my garage into the house . I put one on each side . What can I say it made me a hero
5 #### I priced this in one of the cell phone stored in the mall . It was priced at $ 15 . I got it from the vendor for $ 4 ( including S&H ) . Looks good on my phone , and feels great in my hand . I highly recommend it . It was also delivered promptly . I was VERY impressed . Good job AMAZON ! ! ! ! !
1 #### This is junk . I have never had one sound so bad . It does n't even hold a charge for very long
1 #### Great for holding your wireless pack to your strap . I go through one of these about every 2 years because the hook and loop material starts to pull apart and the faux leather backing on the hold down strap starts to fall apart . But for the price I 'll keep picking one up . Or until I find something better . Edit : the most recent one I purchased started to fall apart after a couple of months . The hook and loop is barely useable and the faux leather backing is already gone .
5 #### The Hamilton Caps works lots better than my clamp on with the spring . I can put more down pressure on this kind . Do n't know how long the threads will last but so far its been fine .
5 #### These are right up there with WD-40 and Duct Tape as all that a man needs to fix the world . i use them for wiring and in my back yard and they are durable , versatile and easy to handle . The jar container is convenient as well for storage . I wish they came in assorted colors including green and black and perhaps they do , had I looked further .
5 #### I read other reviews of these lights and thought they might be a good bargain with a little effort . As soon as I got them I took them apart and removed the defuser . You MUST pay attention to how you aim your lights when you do this . Also , be very carefull making sure you line the gaskets up well when you put the lights back together . The install hardware was ok and they went in easily . The lights are nice and bright and well worth the money and minimal effort I put in to them . I ca n't comment on how they are out of the box but I think they 're great if you have phillips screwdriver and a little time .
5 #### I was finding that many of my activities were going unphotographed because I did n't have a way to safely carry my equipment . Activities such as bike riding , cross country skiing or canoeing have not been a part of my photohistory -- until I got the Tamrac Expedition 3 backpack . The " Expedition " holds my SLR with a 300 mm lens , my standard lens , my off camera flash , extra film , standard filters and cleaning supplies , with room left over for my keys and money . Everything is well padded and secure , and the pack is quite small and sits squarely on my back . A sturdy top handle allows it to be carried in hand , and its small size makes this possible without dragging it along the ground as I do so . The materials used are very sturdy ; the pack can stand on its own and does not " collapse . " The only down side , and this is true of any camera backpack , is the need to take it off and zip it open to get at your gear . If this would be a concern , you may want to check out the top - loading hip packs , which I passed on since they always feel awkward to me . Years of hauling backpacks make the " Expedition " seem like second nature to me . No longer will my photohistory suggest couch potato - dom ; now I can shoot my exploits on trail or river , thanks to the " Expedition ! "
5 #### It came today after I ordered on Sunday ! I 'm very pleased it fits my new cellphone so perfect . And it 's perfect color purple which is my favorite color . I would order from this company again .
5 #### Great product ! Wish I 'd converted years ago ! Razor - sharp beam cutoff . Choose your own H4 bulbs - I used stock ones that I had laying around and I am completely amazed . These fit into American head light holders there 's just a small tab of metal that needs to be ground off or I used a pair of dykes to clip it . They still have two locating pins and the half of one you clipped , so the lights stay aimed correctly .
3 #### I bought these and never used them so I ca n't give a fair review . They seemed ok , these are always so hard to put on .
5 #### This is my first Raspberry Pi and I am loving it . I am currently building an Alarm clock out of it but I am already planning my next several projects that will utilize this device . 5/5 will buy again .
5 #### They do what they say they 'll do ! ! ! Looking forward to buy more from this maker for the rest of my studio !
5 #### 2 years later and it has n't faded and my wife is still pleased with it . Great price and a good quality product .
5 #### this is all good.just like the one that came with my phone . I needed another wall charger to put in my bedroom and found this one.it 's great.and it really charges my phone in a short amount of time . if you'r looking for the original charger this is the one .
5 #### this were my first picks . all of this were included when i bought my electric guitar 2 years ago . I especially love 0.96 , 1.14 and 0.71 they are still alive only 1 is broken 0.46 . I ordered pack of 0.96 because it was my favourite one . Editing review after 4 years . I still got these and I still love them . I tryed many picks but these guys will stay as my favourite ones . Every person who got this picks from me say same thing . These picks are just amazing
5 #### Excellent transaction ! Received item in excellent condition and just as described Thanks a lot !
4 #### What can I say ? It does what it 's supposed to , it clamps down solid and clamps quick and easy on the head stock when not in use . There are other styles of capos on the market , this one does fine for me . Yes , I would recommend it to a friend .
4 #### Nice sounding strings on my acoustic . So far so good .
5 #### This works great , we use it to clean video's , CD , and DVD 's . When this one gets old I will buy another one .
5 #### My strings feel silky and slippery , the tone is somewhat improved , great buy , i highly reccomend ghs fast fret
5 #### Bought and sent a quantity of 3 of these for my sons television in his out of state college apartment . They hide the wiring - he said they worked perfectly and blend in with the wall now hiding the unsightly heavy black wiring
5 #### Bought this unit based on reviews listed here -- have not been disappointed . Nice unit , easy to use and of seemingly good quality . Happy customer !
5 #### This product was recommended to me by EZ - On tops . As the top was brand new , and I want to keep it that way , I applied the protectant soon after installation of the top . That was three months ago and the top still looks wet and showroom quality . I will do another application before winter , but this stuff really works !
5 #### Not sure if u can mess up a jack stand
3 #### I do n't quite agree with Vandoren this time ( other than their reeds ) , because this mouthpiece is WWWAAYYY TOO OPEN . If you want that kind of mouthpiece then get it , but other than that do n't . If you do n't know what kind of mouthpiece to get get Vandoren M30 13 Series ( if your American , if you 're not American then get the regular Vandoren M30 ) or the Rico Reserve mouthpiece . Both find mouthpieces .
4 #### This is a much , much better headset than the old HS500 . This has the BT 2.0 standard . It delivers better range ( aka more than ten feet ) , great sound quality and works with more devices than anything i 've seen in a similar price range . The battery life is great too . Its downsides are the multifunction button that is way to easy to press , and the fact that it does not have the ability to filter out non voice sounds .
5 #### Nothing special . I does the job . One key note * * * I was having problems connecting external devices to my Google Wifi device with an older switch . Once I used this Netgear switch , all of the issues went away . So , this device is compatible with Google Wifi device .
5 #### i bought this for a canon T2i and even though it is not listed as compatible it works perfectly on it . this item works in the same way your on body button does ... half down focuses , all the way down shoots , hold it down and it continues to shoot and you can push it down and forward and it will hold the continuous shooting until you unclick it . love it .
5 #### It 's okay . I decided to try it out because my favorite Independent band , Boyce Avenue , uses the brand and their guitar sounds so nice live . Anyway , they 're durable and lasts long . However , the strings are kind of hard to press compared to the usual strings that I use . Also , I do n't like how it eliminates the squeeky noise when sliding chords and whatnot -- makes me feel like I have a silent guitar . The tone is nice and balanced , but not quite bright in my ears . Still giving it a 5 though because they 're very durable and clean looking compared to the ones I usually use , which after about 5 days of heavy duty usage it turns to a different color .
5 #### They 're Dunlop . They 're Tortex . They 're firm and they cling well while picking or strumming . They do what they do very well . I am moving away from thinner picks to better refine my left / right hand coordination and these work just fine . Get these and a metronome and practice , practice practice ! !
3 #### It was easy to put on , fit well , holes in the right place . Had a good mirrored finish and you could see through it without much difficulty . I decided that I did n't like it that much . Somewhat hard to see in bright sunlight , but that would be expected . Price was right .
5 #### no honestly it works fine . not much more to say other than its a long cord .. lol . so you can move to another room if you want .. lol
4 #### This is a great " no thrills " metronome , where it only provides a solid loud beat and a light feature . It 's nice to have subdivision and other note variants , but sometimes simplicity works too . I wish it had a volume knob though , the beat is pretty loud ( which is good is some situations but not good in others ) .
4 #### Bought this to replace creme colored switch on my Gibson LP Standard . It 's as advertised and it fits . One gripe : $ 5 for a 0.10 piece of tiny plastic ? Ouch ! But what are you gon na do ? Cheers
5 #### My external DVD had gotten so bad about skipping and so slow I was about ready to dispose of it . I ran the cleaner and it runs like a new one . It also mad a noticible improvement with my internal drive .
3 #### The ETX is in many ways a marvelous little scope . Optically , it 's far and above most 90 mm catadioptric scopes , like the Celestron 90 . Mechanically , though , it leaves a bit to be desired . There are a few too many flimsy plastic parts , the clock drive is not terribly accurate , and the drive clutch has way too much slop in it . The human engineering aspect leaves a lot to be desired as well . The finder scope is almost impossible to use as set up . The mount makes it impossible to view though the scope or finder in many orientations . What Meade tried to do here is create a clone of the $ 4,000 Questar at a bargain price . Optically they 've done well ( though it still falls short of a Questar ) but in copying the mechnical design opf the Questar they had to leave out precisely those details that make the Questar such a pleasure to use . The $ 599 price is a little misleading . While designed for tabaletop use , unless you have a cast concrete tabletop you 'll need a solid tripod to support it , so you can add another $ 150 right there , bringing the actual cost to more like $ 749 . And for that price there are a lot of good choices around . They make not look as slick , but they 're a lot more usable .
4 #### I loved this case for my iPhone 3GS . I was happy to find it for my iPhone 4 , however it 's very flimsy and really only good for looks . If you are not one to take care of your phone - e.g : drop it frequently , you might only consider this case for show on specific occasions . If you can maintain this case for every day use , keep in mind that the design will wear off over time . I had 2 of them in about 6 months for my 3GS just because the design started to fade .
5 #### Works great , sturdy and holds most any size coffee mug or glass
5 #### Nice loud sound . Great to use for people with hearing difficulty .
4 #### This phone is sharp ! I bought this for a very good friend who wanted a retro phone ( do n't ask me why ) . But he is all over the item . He love the thinga - ma - jigga . Now he sporting chats allover the place ! Nuff long talk too .
5 #### I use it with a Garmin StreetPilot 7200 , which is a fairly large , even somewhat clunky GPS with a large 7 - inch screen . The screen does vibrate just a bit when going down the road , but nothing major . I have it sitting on the dash of an Armada , inside a slightly crevassed area just to the right of my steering wheel / main console . It sits perfectly , so I can see it with my bi - focal sunglasses and still clearly see the road . I have had no problems with it sliding off or tipping . It has a locking mechanism at the bottom , which I can not slide over to lock the mount connection because the Garmin GPS is already wedged so tightly into the beanbag mount ; no big deal though ... doubt I would use it anyway , I do n't see the need since it fits so securely without it . It is a well - made beanbag mount that I think will last a while and I got it for a great price here on Amazon .
4 #### This charger works great . needed one for the car and this one works fine good product at a good price
5 #### I saw it 's the best for 2 reasons : 1 ) It sounds amazing , looks amazing and is really fun to play , and 2 ) although you could find other piccolo 's with similar or comparable sound , you ca n't get it at this price . I use this instead of a snare because I use quite a few rolls when i play a song and they come out so much crisper and cleaner on the piccolo . On the snare you get a lot of buzz and echo when you do a buzz roll or an open stroke roll , but on the piccolo it snaps and cracks like a whip , defining the precision of each strike on the head . Pearl makes some incredible equipment at very reasonable prices and this is a prime example of a great quality instrument . Look no further , whether you want a piccolo to add to a set with a snare or want to swap it for with your snare for a sharper tone for your style of music you wo n't go wrong with this baby .
5 #### I will not play with normal drum sticks unless I am forced too . these things are so comfy and look so nice . I love the sound they bring those light " tics " they bring with each hit really adds a sound I like . I probably should have gotten the smaller , lighter pair but these were still amazing . go buy them
5 #### Good quality and the angled plug is great for remote miking digital cameras .
3 #### It 's ok but not great . It is a bit too thin and too flexible .
5 #### Have Elixir 's on all my acoustic guitars and mandolins . Love them .
4 #### Well I read the ad and I watched the video - it all made sense so I bought the product . Well it DOES work as advertized . The noise cancelling feature is amazing . I was driving my diesel SUV on the highway with a ton of ambient noise and I called a geek friend . He could not hear anything but my voice loud and clear . The bonus was that I could hear him loud and clear as well . The only reason I would only go 4 stars for this is that it is still a somewhat bulky geekey device and I have to turn the volume up with each call . It does not seem to hold the setting ? Other than that it is truly a superior product . I have purchased and returned at least 6 different types of these in the past but this one is a keeper for sure . With the lawmakers all over the world making rules against cell phone use in the car its the only way to go . PS I also have a speaker phone device for the car but it is totally useless by comparison .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R16SEN01KZG4Q9 " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / D11cDRW7ZzS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/21sVfv5gUtS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;I got this for a particular purpose : To approximate the sound that the Beatles got from their Gibson J160E 's using my Taylor 314 . And it worked pretty well ! And you ca n't fault the usability ; the pickup mounts very easily . I actually made a little video about it , which you can watch if you like .
5 #### I just started taking guitar lessons about 8 months ago . My guitar teacher told me that the Elixir brand is one of the best and lasts the longest due to the special coating of the strings , and he was right . I use these strings for my Taylor GS Mini that initially came with Elixir 's Medium - gauge strings . They were too tough for my newbie , un - callused fingertips , so I switched over to the Extra Lights , and they make playing a lot easier .
5 #### It is a LN fuse and it works . That 's all anyone can really say about it . Rating something as fundemental as a electrical fuse is really not worth the time ,
5 #### My wife was tired of my guitars being stored on guitar stands on the bedroom floor so she asked me to get some of these to hang the guitars on the wall in the closet . Comes with all the hardware needed to attach it to the wall . After measuring / leveling , I drilled two holes , installed the anchor / inserts into the drywall , and installed the screws . Total job took less than 5 minutes ! I 'm buying more of these !
5 #### Replaced my old worn pull that was to short to reach . This one is left hanging down about six inches after the awning is rolled up so it is easy to reach now and does n't hang out so far that it 's flopping everywhere while on the road .
1 #### I know , I know ... you get what you pay for . However , I thought I 'd get more than a few uses from them . Gentle home use , nothing more . I did n't pull on it or step on it but within days it started buzzing . I tried the spare and after a few days it started with the crackling too . They were cheap enough to not go through the headache of trying to get my money back for this trash . Avoid these sorry cables . I wish I could give it zero stars .
5 #### I bought one of these for every one of my acoustics ; they 're fantastic .
5 #### This little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac . The name is rather misleading as it was n't designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction .
1 #### Bought two of these cameras to take photos for insurance purposes . There was no flash when I took the photos , so when I called the company they confirmed that was correct . When I took another shot , there was a flash . Needless to say , nothing came out . Can anyone recommend a digital ?
4 #### I love Brother label - makers -- they are the easiest to use . This standard tape is good and has lasted me a long time . Will not stick on large plastic containers very well , but does fine on smaller containers for holding sugar , coffee , decaf , flour , etc . I wish Brother would make it easier to remove the backing on this labels . It takes much longer than printing up and printing out the label itself .
4 #### I purchased this to download digital copies to my computer since it does n't have a cd rom . So far , so good . It reads the DVDs and I have tried the play feature . However , I have not tried to burn a CD so I could not tell you if it works or not . I will keep you updated .
5 #### Best sounding open ear headphones I 've ever heard . I 've used them almost every day for a long time . Bass is very powerful for something that does n't enclose the ear . Sound is very clear and they can also handle a lot of power . As others have said , the headband can rip out a few hairs occasionally , but that is the only complaint I have .
3 #### The DT200V for about $ 10-$20 less performs better , lacking only the DT300VW 's weather band . The 300VW is a little smaller and lighter . Both are small enough for a shirt pocket , perhaps with a bit of sag . The weather band does n't work very well , getting the same station on every channel on my DT300VW . The DT200V can be operated in the dark ; this is impossible with the complex operation of the DT300VW . The performance difference is most noticeable on the AM band , where the DT200V does remarkably well in distance reception . The DT300VW uses AAA batteries instead of AA , and has a ( unusual ) subminiature jack on the earphone jacks , requiring an adapter ( included ) to use any other earphones .
5 #### The best strings money can buy . I have always loved the Polyweb and prefer them to the Nanoweb . I love that when I put a fresh set on , stretch them and tune up my Taylor First Edition 810e they feel like new strings but sound like strings that have been played on for a couple hours ... just long enough to get rid of the ultra high , spanky , metallic sound that fresh strings have . I have been experimenting with the Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze mediums since Taylor now equips their new guitars with this type and they are great too . Especially , since Amazon can sell and ship them to me in 2 days for less than GC and big box stores sell them ! Fast shipping , unbelievable service and the world 's finest guitar string and a great price make this a no - brainer home run of a deal ! Buy them .
3 #### No frills but it works . I have since taken to using a different mount that does n't require clipping the phone in .
4 #### Not anywhere large enough to hold all the items advertised . It is , however , a good size for my smaller Oly OMD EM-10 and three smaller lenses designed for Olympus mirrorless cameras ( 14 - 42 mm F3.5 EZ , 25 mm F1.8 prime and 40 - 150 mm F4.0 ) . I can also squeeze in two batteries , battery charger and cord , an extra SD card , the USB cable ( that came with the camera ) , and a towel . Hardly anything else will fit . BUT , the quality of the case is quite good and it should last longer than the items it holds ( sadly ! ) .
5 #### About every five years in need to replace this battery in a " loss of electricity " lantern that is wall mounted .... it seems to be a routine maintenance expense that is reasonable .
5 #### This is a very useful product for those people who have more devices than they do network jacks . It works , and it 's inexpensive . As more and more network - capable consumer electronic products come out , the greater the need will be for devices like these . I am currently using this product to share a single network jack between a Windows PC and a MacIntosh Pro . Speed is much more than sufficient . Your internet connection speed will be the bottleneck in most cases , not your home network . One thing to keep in mind though is that not all devices will work if you have this switch between the device and your office network 's switch / hub . I could not get the IP telephone at work to function through this switch . However , the computers have no trouble under the same conditions . I confess that I am not knowledgeable when it comes to IP phones though . This is a very handy device . I highly recommend it .
4 #### This is great for when you need an extra long cord for your iphone or ipad . I would recommend this .
5 #### I cut these into four pieces to create a small towel to take on my runs . I live outside of Houston and it gets very humid and hot fast . These are great running towels . I also use them to wipe down the dust from the dashboard of my cars . Removes the dust and lint without the harsh chemicals .
5 #### I used the mount for my motorcycle . I love the casing and it is easy to change . It makes it water proof too . I think it would of been perfect if I actually put it on a bicycle like it is made for . I had to do a little modification with the mount itself being that my motorcycle handle bar is a little thicker than what it was made for . Highly recommend ... for bicycle !
5 #### Make your life easy and get this ! Just solder your new head unit harness up with the corresponding color codes and plug it in . You 'll be so glad you did . Will not work with the factory sub if you have one . I was replacing mine any way and adding an amp so that was n't an issue .
4 #### It 's a good banjo capo . Inexpensive and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune . End of story
3 #### To be honest , I would give five stars if it fit the Incredible 2 . It does not . The clip works but not the case . I would suggest adding this disclaimer to the sale site . The service I received was prompt and I have no other problem that it did n't fit .
4 #### Its so small , so hard to play but with practise it will happen . Very cute !
5 #### Had to wait longer to receive , however great item . I gave one to my neighbor and she thought I was a big giver , did n't tell her that I did n't pay a lot for it . I use mine all the time on my new tablet . Would recommend !
1 #### Headset has quite bad microphone ; people complain much more than with my old Motorola Headset about the voice quality and amount of noise . Not worth the price .
5 #### The product was delivered as indicated and as described . Had a lot of fun with it .
5 #### This radio is a good deal . It compares to my RCA globetrotter that gets good am reception . The performance is better then the radioshack 20 - 125 whitch has synthesyzer or display noise whitch sucks not to mention that it mutes while scanning so if your blind do knot get this radio . The sangean is easy to use and if connected to a fence with wire shortwave performance gets even better . Becarfull with the tuning becuss it can break[mine did ] so i ordered another one . Grait radio sangean !
4 #### I have used multiple headsets , with the most current being a Jabra JX10 , and a Blueant V1 , and have never been completely happy . The JX10 was o.k . but had a lot of background noise . The V1 was pretty good but the voice commands drove me crazy waiting for them to finish before I could speak . The Voyager Pro is almost perfect . The audio is really nice and the outgoing audio is just spectacular . I made a call today in my Jeep , while traveling down the freeway , and the person on the other end thought I was at home in my living room . The size does not bother me and the fit is good , even though I wear glasses . The only thing that keeps me from saying the Voyager Pro is perfect is the lack of support for call waiting . I read many review before buying this unit , which said it supported call waiting . I now believe that they are in error , or at least I have not found a way to switch between a call in progress and an incoming call , without hanging up on the first call . Overall , highly recommended .
5 #### It 's a great bag ! my pedalboard barely fits and bulges out a little but i know it was n't meant for that . It 's still an overall awesome bag .
4 #### These are your typical patch cables . They work fine for what they are . I will be ordering a bunch more for my computer projects .
4 #### I have heard problems about knock - off MDR - V6 's on this site , but this is n't one of them . Build quality is very good . Sounds amazing ( my first pair of real cans ) . My parents had just bought 2 pairs of Bose OE2 's for $ 99 , and both agreed that my cheaper V6 's sound better ! My only complaint is that the bass runs a bit thin for my tastes ... but it is actually pretty accurate . These are not the bass - heavy Beats that sound best with rap music and not much else ; the V6 's sound amazing with everything from Classical to Rock to R&B to Soul to Primus . My iPhone 4S drives them good enough to not " need " a headphone amplifier ( but of course I still " want " one , LOL ) . Be forewarned though ; these cans reproduce the sound SO ACCURATELY that now , poorly - compressed MP3s now annoy the heck out of me . I can even hear the difference between my 128kbps AAC 's and my lossless ALAC files . I finally had an excuse to re - rip a bunch of CDs into 256kbps AAC and/or ALAC now . Very comfortable , even for hours at a time . I want to try the velvet ear pads just to see how they are , but the stock ones are still very comfortable . If you 're on the fence , and you do n't need a huge bottom end , these wo n't disappoint you .
4 #### I was delighted to find out I could have this phone with t - mobile . TM is by far the best deal where I live but so far it 's had less than desirable phones . I am very pleased with this phone . The phone is n't exactly small like many reviews claimed but it does fit nicely in a hip pocket . It 's very long and wide , but fairly thin . This is my first Bluetooth phone and that feature works very well with a Jabra 250 headset . Pros * Aesthetically pleasing minimalist design * Top notch voice quality * Top notch reception * Charges with USB mini ( can be charged with computer ) * Adequate battery life ( maybe two days worth of heavy use ) * Easy to read both displays * Voice activated dialing works smoothly * Easy to set up Bluetooth ( Even non - Motorola ) * Mp3 ringers Cons * Really needs an external LED for missed call alerts etc * Phone and Bluetooth headset must be kept on the same side of the body for best sound * Vibrating alert is very faint * The volume and voice - dial buttons are on the wrong end of the phone making them awkward to hit while talking * The phone feels flimsy ( I 'll try not to drop it ) * The phone is a little on the wide side to dial comfortably with my thumb * Same old Motorola interface ( not bad , just not great )
5 #### I LOVE THIS CASE . IT LOOKS GREAT , FEELS NICE , AND LIGHT WEIGHT , JUST AS IT SAYS . MY SON 'S FENDER SQUIRE JAZZ BASE V ( 5 STRING ) FIT GREAT IN IT .
1 #### My biggest mistake - i bought four of these by reading the glowing reviews here . Now I have two , still unwrapped that I am willing to give away , and two which are all bent and twisted from using pliers trying to take the wires out . These channels should do a good job of mentioning just how thick they are . All I wanted to do is to use these to carry ONE HDMI cable and ONE speaker cable . These are so stiff that they are difficult to put in AND take out . Cut tears in my precious expensive HDMI cable in the process . I decided to buy and use http://www.amazon.com/UT-Wire-UTW-CC1001-WH-10-Feet-Channel/dp/B001709NT6 instead which was far more practical and roomy .
5 #### This product is awesome . I use it most to keep stuff from sliding to far forward in the bed of the truck so I can still reach it from the tailgate .
5 #### Really a very good product , it does the drying and cleaning job very good and it last years without sowing failing simptoms , only precaution that you must consider es to clean it very well after use , absolutelly recomended product .
5 #### I have used this for 10 + years to dry my car after washing , as well as a few other spills . I just bought another one , because my other one that I have been using for over 10 years disappeared . When you are done using it , just wring it out and put it back in the plastic tube damp and it is ready to go for the next time . Works much much better than a real chamois . Made in Japan ( not China ! )
4 #### Very good product fro small engines . I have 3 lawns mowers two weed whackers and a riding mower and all of them are doing fine . Even when I started using them after a cold winter in Vermont they started as they had been used the day before . Angelo Caserta
3 #### not too comfortable , maybe would be if my ears were giant sized . sound is okay .
4 #### Yep . An old classic . No styling changes for 20 - plus years . But they got it right the first time . Very lightweight and excellent sound . I use Grados for my serious listening , but these are just super for portable use . Probably why they call them ' PortaPro . ' Only complaint , the top band is a little tweeky and thin . A wider band would render these bad boys perfect . Ca n't do better for the bucks though . Happy listening ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Reasonably priced and they work fine . The world of Midi is not simple , but you can do amazing things with it . I just ordered three more of these .
4 #### Okay so I gave it a four star only because if your like me and like to switch up the look of your phone or use the hd dock you need to be able to take the case off but I saw I had to bring out the tools sheesh I thought for a minute I was going to have to go into my cartoon mode and bring out the hammer lol . Overall I dig the slick look of it and the way it protects my phone trust me when I say it is a good product for the cost . Overall will still do buisness with this company . In addition to this if you are curious about if your package will arrive on time I ca nt speak for you but I did recieve my package within the time it adviced so no worries there you will get the product .
5 #### OMG I had no idea why I was getting so ill . This told me why ! The power conditioner on my desk was off the scale . Our hybrid car was off the scale , and tried to go further off the scale when you press the break peddle . All our " energy saving " light bulbs were off the scale . Now we 're testing everything and we 're in a MUCH better environment . Both of us are concentrating better , sleeping better and generally feeling better . Ca n't recommend this enough ! ! ! Get it ! You 'll be shocked at what 's going on around you !
5 #### I use this just about every day . It 's the most convenient capo . It does throw your guitar out of tune a bit more than Shubb or G9 , but it 's more quick and convenient , which is crucial for me . I 'm often working with kids and leading services at my temple with my guitar , and it 's great to be able to place it with one hand and not disrupt the flow of what I 'm doing . No one notices or cares if I 'm thrown slightly out of tune . If I 'm playing a coffeehouse , everyone is doing their patter while tuning between every song anyway . I have used some of the other capos mentioned in that situation .
5 #### I received this as a gift . It fits my Epiphone Hummingbird Pro perfectly . The interior looks great and has a nice warming feeling to it . Also has a good - sized storage compartment .
5 #### I had one of these for like 6 years now and it still works but bought this exact replacement to let the old retire . Forget the others , this is the " one " !
5 #### Works great . I installed this in a Suburban SF-30 furnace along with a new ignitor . It already had one of these boards in it but something got inside the unit ( a mouse , I think ) and damaged a component on the board . It would blow cold air but not ignite . After taking it apart I found the damaged component so ordered a new board and replaced the ignitor as well since it was looking pretty old . Glad to have this furnace working again .
4 #### Typical Guitar strings from a brand name company . Good , not great ...... but good none the less ! I have to say I am impressed they seem to be consistent in quality !
4 #### I like this pick . You ca n't see it in the picture , but it 's actually transparent yellow . The pick has a slightly rubbery feel to it , and feels more natural than a Tortex . Unlike a Tortex , the logo does not rub off in your hands . I still like the Jazz III better , but the Ultex is good .
5 #### I was looking for an affordable case and this certainly fit the bill . I wanted clip and loops on the back so I could normally just clip to a belt , but when I was going to be in a crowded area or international trip I could have the added safety of the loops . I 've had friends whose cell phones were stolen in airports by clever thieves who can slip a clipped case right off a belt . So the case was inexpensive and secure but added bonus , it looks very classy . Black , sturdy looking leather outside , soft , tan kid glove type leather inside . It goes well with a suit . I 've now had two of them .
2 #### received broken ... sent back ... didn't really want to .. would loved to have heard it jam .. but had a loose battery ( sounded like it ) and sparked everytime i plugged in ... may eventually go with cheaper unit before i give up .. good luck with yours .. p.s . AMAZON TOOK CARE OF RETURN IN A MATTER OF MINUTES .. HATS OFF TO THEM .. TKS AGAIN
4 #### For the money , this works . The goose neck is nice and stiff so it does n't fall and the light is adequate for mixing desk use .
5 #### This is the perfect extension for using with my Reese Towpower dodge ram light . At present it works very well . Well please with the price and function of the product .
5 #### If you 're looking for a charger that can charge up your smart phone at least twice if not three times before needing to be recharged , this is for you . It 's small and easy to travel with , charges up quickly after use , and charges your devices in no time . It wo n't recharge an iPad fully but it 'll give you at least 50 % extra run time . I love the size for dropping it in a bag when I 'm on the go .
5 #### Nice bluetooth at a low price . It takes a lickin and keeps on talkin . It 's a little bulky by today 's standards but works great .
5 #### Wow , glad I spent a little more on this one . This is from a reputable company . The materials are high quality . The arm band strap is very comfortable . It fit my Droid 4 perfectly , I was nervous at first because this one said made for variety of smart phones . But the droid 4 fits in perfect and top is covered and all . Have n't tried out the key holder .
5 #### Got a few of these to have in the studio for when they disappear to the same place as guitar picks .
5 #### Easy to install and hides the cables perfectly . A little tough getting the longer tubes closed after the wires are inside , but a little help from a flat bladed screwdriver helps . I easily put an HDMI and power cord inside and could probably have squeezed in a coax cable as well .
5 #### This is a great case . It has a screen and keyboard protector that is functional and fits very well .
4 #### Works fine , just gives the error message not confirmed as an original device
5 #### Purchased these shields for our BlackBerry Phones . I have a Curve 8530 model and my husband has Tour 9630 model . To my suprise the shields fits both of our phones and very well . There is 3 in a package and they come with micro cloths . They are a high quality and very durable feeling protector . I am pleased that I purchased from Amazon and not from Walmart where you have to trim to fit . They arrived on the exact day that it was said that they would . Very pleased ...
5 #### Hands free holder for my iPod . Clips on AC vent on dash .
5 #### Great sound for a reasonable price . Not sure how they will hold up , but very happy so far .
5 #### I 've had one of these bars for 15years never had a problem with it.excellent product does what it is designed to do . I would recommend to anyone .
4 #### they sound great on a P bass but the string tension is a bit much for my bass
5 #### Very nice and great adhesion , looks like the real thing !
5 #### I have purchased multiple pairs of these headphones over the years and each time I have been satisfied . The price has gone up a bit recently and I can only assume this is due to the recent discovery of these cans by a new community of audio enthusiasts . Only quality issue I 've ever experienced is damage to the cable near the 3.5 mm jack from nearly a decade of use ( and abuse ) . Definitely recommend these to someone looking for solid headphones for less than $ 100 . One of the best products Sony has ever made . I did notice that the packaging has undergone some minor design changes since the last time I purchased a pair .
5 #### They are what they are . a wire with alligator clips on both sides . does not feel like they will break easily so I gave it 5Stars .
3 #### The product is an excellent design but it has a weak spot . As many reviewers mentioned , it broke after the first week or so . The small swivel pin joining the two parts of the case is weak and broke . The company gave me an instant refund ( which I did n't ask for because the whole cost was so low ) . I bought another one and will not use the swivel feature . So far it is holding up . The design is so good it 's too bad it has a poor swivel . I recommend it . Just do n't use the swivel , i.e. use it vertically , as it comes from the box .
5 #### Very solid equipment . I have used several through the years with little to no problem . FYI ... POE switches are more susceptible to lightning strikes !
5 #### This is my second order of the 10 pack . A local store wants 29.99 for one set of these . The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands I 've tried ; including , and especially the most commonly used eb 's . I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings . On occasion , it looks as if the winding is chipping off , but not at the frets . I change strings quite often so it really does n't matter . Not sure what that 's about but it does n't affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars . Any less and I 'd look dumb .
5 #### Works great on my daughter 's Yamaha . Came with an adapter and it fits perfectly and she can practice while the boys are watching tv and nobody gets annoyed at the other now
5 #### Well this cable has worked great so far . Its thick seems like nice quality and puts out a clear 480p picture . For the price I could n't have asked for more ...
5 #### I have bought two of these for home and office use . They work flawlessy and for the price you can not beat the functionality . I was running at least Windows 98 on all computers I hooked up to the ethernet hub . Windows makes it easy to set up file and printer sharing . After you are hooked up to a network you will not need to swap disks all the time in order to exchange information or to move files for printing . You can transfer a hundred megabytes in a minute or two depending on the kinds of files . Setup is a breeze if you have ethernet cards installed already . Even if you do not have cards installed already there are instructions to walk you through step by step . By the way , if you are just using this for a home network , pick out the Netgear hub combo that gives you the most stuff for the cheapest . I have bought at least 3 different ones and the all provide the same functionality as far as I can tell . It is just that sometimes they come with one more port , or an extra cable , or multiple speed compatibilities .
5 #### Received this item promptly . Did n't actually take it out for testing , but when trying the different attachments to the vehicle hitch , I found this tightener eliminated almost all the rattling and loose fitting noises . I do n't suspect there will be an issue with noise on the road . I own a bike rack with a 1 1/4 " mount , a carrier , and the hitch ball mount . All 3 items snugged up very well . I will consider buying another one . This thing 's constructed HEAVY DUTY . I feel as long as I do n't overtighten the nuts , it should be fine . Glad I got it .
5 #### Easy to install , Looks professional . Does the job . It is designed to pair with a similar - looking USB port . I found the USB port more of a problem , getting only intermittent contact . Blue Sea replaced the USB socket without charge . I would assume they would with this product as well .
4 #### A little on the slippery side but function as they should .
5 #### worked perfectly to place a tv in the corner and have it angle out to the rest of the room . good flexibility with tilting the arms , and very easy to install into one stud . would recommend .
4 #### Simple and functional . What more can you say ? It keeps my desk organized .
1 #### Iomega disks have to be the worst form of storage media ever created . They are easily corruptable . I ca n't tell you the number of disks I 've had to throw away because they have died on me . They 've destroyed projects that I 've saved on them . Projects that were unretrievable because all of a sudden the disk can not be read by the computer or even worse freezes the computer . On top of all this , Iomega disks are way too expensive for being such a bad product . I even had to ask an Iomega technician what I was doing wrong . After going over possible scenerios of what I 've might of done , we both concluded it was n't me but indeed there was something wrong with the disks . My advice is to stay away from Iomega disks and all other Iomega products and go with CD - RW disks of any brand . They store more info , are much cheaper and are much more reliable .
5 #### I 've been using mine for well over a year now . I have a large , high compression 454 engine that requires a little ass to spin it over . This nifty little toy always makes that happen .
3 #### This case has lasted for the past month that my son has used it , but it 's starting to show visible " lines " , ( almost like small cracks ) throughout . I 'll post an update if it does break , but the lines do n't give me a good feeling about the quality of this case .
5 #### For the money , these headphones are excellent . Sound great , do n't look goofy and seem well made enough .
5 #### Bought this for a home network . Speed is great , reliability is great and it 's plug and play .
5 #### I bought this as an alternative to a floor - stand for my guitar . I wo n't ever return to floor - stands in my home music studio , this sturdy holder keeps my instruments out of harm 's way and so that cleaning the area is a snap .
3 #### My family is very hard on cables . These cables were nice and long , but just could n't handle being moved around a lot , and died within a few weeks of purchase .
4 #### I am changing my review of the company and customer service after their represtentative phoned and apologized for the problems and explained that their off site email department was not forwarding my emails . He also offered to give a discount on a future purchase , there fore I am changing my rating from a one star to a four star . I would do business with this company in the future if they continue with this personal customer service . Had to file an Amazon claim .... I recieved two sets , instead of one needed so I returned one set and requested a refund . The invoice says Vangoddy in Chino Hills , California and not the shipper listed on the item description page .... so that 's who I contacted directly as it was a marketplace seller . After one initial communication to let them know that it was being returned and the response was that they would refund me ...... they never refunded me nor did they reply to any of the multiple emails I sent .. Amazon 's A - Z guarantee has refunded me .
5 #### Not much should be wrong with Ethernet cable and nothing was wrong with this . Performs as it should , no problems .
5 #### This arrived in only two days so I popped it in on the way to pick up the kiddos . This directions are on the disc and really simple . The cd makes an annoying beeping sounds while cleaning ( I turned the radio down and kept checking for it to finish ) but that is my only dislike . The packaging was very study . I will definitely buy from this seller again .
2 #### Well , what can I say ? Based on the customer reviews , this purchase seemed like a no - brainer . However , after only 4 months of light use ( used on my rig at home ) it is toast . The cable barely holds a signal now ( constantly need to jiggle the thing to work ) . And before you ask , " is it perhaps your output jack ? " , all of my other cables work with my gee - tar . So it is definitely the cable :( Anyway , I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120 .
5 #### I play fiddle , my Dominant 's started busting so I ordered these . Great sound and the price is much better . I will stick with them from now on .
2 #### This product worked great the first day I had it , then it broke in 2 places while trying to remove the charger from the unit . I am a commercial truck driver and can not talk without a handsfree headset in my rig legally after 1 - 08 . I am still waiting for a replacement even though the company is located 1 hour from me .
4 #### I got this as a gift to my sister . The best thing is that is small , flips , has a hardware keyboard and it is Android . However , after a couple of years of use it 's shows age . It was good while it lasted .
5 #### They are strings , they make noise , and they last a long time . I will always use Polywebs !
5 #### So good . Found these years ago as a solution to peeling finger tips : My skin was reacting to oxidizing strings . Elixirs were n't popular at the time , hard to find , and were cheap ( & my fingers stopped peeling ) . I was worried that they would not be popular enough to survive . I bought a whole bunch . Now they are well - known ... and not cheap . They sound great , last a very long time , and beat out other strings that were highly recommended ( sound , playability ) . So all around , a great solution for me .
5 #### A definite upgrade , over the original strings , that came on my Violin . A softer , sweeter sound ...
5 #### I was using an older Logitech mouse that was corded . I really LOVE this new cordless mouse . If you have shoulder problems from moving that mouse around this is the mouse you need . The thumb ball does all the moving for you . You can program the center button to do a double click with only one click .. (I had a hard time double clicking fast enough ) . I will never go back to the old fashioned mouse .
4 #### purchased as a gift ; recipient had difficulty with it , but I believe that was likely ' user error ' :)
5 #### This cable has been pulled through my attic from the main router to another room to connect a DVR to my network . There were no problems with the process of connecting from either end , and it 's worked very well since it 's been in use . It does not feel like cheap cable , and I have always trusted the Belkin brand . I have bought several in various lengths for my home theater system , video game systems , in more than one room of my house . The connectors fit well and do not feel loose . I have not has any problems with any of them disconnecting when a component has been moved around . I like the lower prices for these here on Amazon vs what they cost in local stores . There are most definitely some cheaper ones here , but Belkin is a name I trust for quality .
5 #### This is an great product for my application on a motorcycle
5 #### O my this is amazing . 5 days of charge before i need to recharge . Fits in my belt pouch with phone in life proof case . Why ca n't we purchase phones with these big batteries .
5 #### I have a Cannon A80 and the Cannon bag made for this camera . It started to wear at the seams when I decided to purchase another bag . Fortunately I bought the Tamrac 5692 . The Cannon bag does n't compare with the Tamrac in both quality and utility . I am very satisfied with my new purchase .
5 #### Match color to color , and everything clicks in place and works perfectly . Very good and accurate adapter . I soldered my connections and taped since no crimp connectors are included .
5 #### It was actually the wrong one , I went on Metra 's website and they showed the correct one , Amazon 's system said this would fit so I went with it , not to mention it does say 00 - 05 and this was going in a 2004 Saturn Ion-2 . It turns out I needed the 70 - 2102 harness , specifically for 04 - 05 . I ended up ripping the cables out of the connector by their pins and replacing them in the correct positions according to the factory harness and a wiring diagram . It ended up working perfectly after modifying it . Partly Amazon 's fault but partly my own for not going with what Metra recommended . I wo n't rate the product down for that , it still worked .
2 #### The Cruiser is a great idea and works well occasionally . The built - in speaker is quite poor , particularly in the lower frequencies - I find it very difficult to distinguish words when someone has a deep voice . When using the FM modulator , the sound is wonderful ; voices clear and as loud as you wish . A major shortcoming for me is trouble with the mulitpoint connections - it just does n't work properly . It is almost impossible to get 2 phones connected at the same time , and when you do , transferring between them almost never seems to work . I 've called tech support and it has n't helped this problem . I 've owned 3 Plantronics headsets with multipoint and it has worked flawlessly . It 's a shame because I prefer the speakphone to an earpiece while driving .
4 #### Thanks god there were 3 protectors . If you are able to understand the instructions , you will be glad with this order . I was n't , so I mess up the first two , but with the 3rd one I was very happy . No bubbles on my bb ! ! ! The best thing , you will have 2 more protectors for a very good price .
5 #### Great strings ! Sound great and last a long time !
5 #### GOOD ! IT WAS A GIFT FOR SOMEBORY ELSE.THERE 'S NOTHING I CAN SAY.GOOD ! IT WAS A GIFT FOR SOMEBORY ELSE.THERE 'S NOTHING I CAN SAY .
5 #### did n't get these picks from amazon but my story goes as this : started playing the guitar 2 years ago in 2010 my teacher told me to use these picks I did , but how ever I started using and assortment of picks and started shaping my own picks for about a year . Well all I can tell you is that I will only use these picks now . They give me the best experience in playing the guitar . easy to grip smooth on strings ( have n't dropped one yet )
5 #### I wanted something to connect my Sony Handycam to TVs and HDMI monitors , but did n't want to pay a fortune . This product hit the mark perfectly . It does n't have all the shielding of a Monster Cable or the like , but I 'm not using it for permanent installation , I 'm using it on the go , and so far I 'm getting perfect picture quality and ease of use ( I needed a long cord ) .
1 #### When I plugged it into my computer , the whole computer turned off . When it powered on , I received this message from the BIOS : " USB device over current status detected " and it shutdown after 15 seconds . I 'm running a self - built computer with an over 900W power supply , and I only had 1 other USB device connected . Out of curiosity , I tried it in another USB port ( on the back ) - same result . Also , the same result in my Toshiba laptop . I also tried it in a USB wall charger I have , and it produced an electric arc . Obviously , it does n't work . I 'm just glad it did n't damage any of my hardware . See if you can find a better quality product - this one is junk .
5 #### Yes it is stunning . It actually looks better in person than in the picture . The shipping is excellent . It came very well protected . I did however change the bulbs for two CFLs . You wo n't regret buying it .
4 #### The phone is a good get for those who want to get an iPhone but would like a cheaper phone with cheaper service . Granted , the iPhone is bigger and a little easier to use ( especially if you already have a Mac to hook it up to ) , but this is good for the casual internet user . Pros : * LCD isplay is fairly crisp . * Service ( where I live , at least ) is better than my old carrier for both voice and data . I get 3G+ data icons even inside the bowels of big LA buildings . * The built - in speakerphone is loud and clear for music and calls . * Phone is crazy cheap on Amazon and probably the best deal out there right now regardless of carrier . * It is possible to tether via Bluetooth fairly easily on a Mac ( a plus for me ) . Cons : * QWERTY keypad is not the easiest to use if you have thick fingers like myself . * Could use more widgets preloaded considering you can not add any yourself . * AT&T seems to like Yahoo ! and MSN but not Google , making you have to download a GMail app that is n't as good as built - in email apps . Of course , if you use these other mail providers then this is n't an issue . * The phone comes with almost no accessories , not even a USB cable . Even when you buy a USB cable , Samsung does not make Mac drivers for easy USB tethering .
5 #### It is hard to find a bag that will fit my convertible , but this does the trick . And , easy to empty
4 #### The fuse comes with the holder ... the materials are sturdy ... only downside is that the cap does n't fit tight , too easy to open . Many applications would be fine with this ...
3 #### Was sort of perfect for my needs : Using an obsolete storage system to take obsolete writing files from an older MAC and copy them to an eMAC . I then had to convert to a current word processing software , OpenSource . Org and then my intent was to plug this Zip Drive into my iMac and copy all those newly translated files to the iMac . But for some reason my iMac could n't " see " or read the Iomega Zip Drive ( it " saw " it at the USB Hub ) . So I had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the eMac . Then I was able to copy to the iMac from the flash drive . ( Their Customer Support said the drive had been tested through MAC OS 10.6 and it worked fine [ have 10.7.5 , Mountain Lion ] ) . In a round about way , the technology served its purpose ! Thank goodness . ( The Seller was quick in responding to my questions . Good Customer Service . )
4 #### For the money it 's a great deal ... for a chep good vox mike ca nt beat it ... i bought it for a gtr palyer in the band who was trying out backing vox ... everyone is happy and I did n't spen a mint
4 #### Good tape and fit my label maker perfectly . The price was right and the shipping and packing was good .
5 #### the Albert Augustine strings are the strings ' highest of class ! very smooth to strum and the sound is superb ! i love using it to my guitars ! its highly recommended ! !
5 #### I needed something simple that did n't take up too much space on my work desk . This organizer did the the job . It 's no - frills and the open wire design lets you see more of your files for quick access . It 's sturdy and adjusts very well for tick files . I can even get a full 3 - ring binder in it which is a plus .
5 #### Light weight and sturdy . Sleek and cool . I love mine . You should get one .
2 #### returned it . no place for guage and to much wireing
5 #### Not much to say- works as needed ; cheap . Will buy again if need . Recommend .
3 #### this a fine wiper blade . I ended up using it on my Jimmy . but do n't be fooled by the claim that it fits on a 2010 vw gti . It just does not fit . The connector is all wrong .
3 #### This was my second RAZR V3 . It did n't last nearly as long as the first one before it quit working and I smashed it .
5 #### This is the best Jazz Guitar cable I have ever had or used in different circumstances in 57 years playing . Makes it feel like you have a new guitar .
4 #### Cable is well built and durable . I purchased two of these and use them to connect my keyboards to my amp . No hum ; worth the money
4 #### Exactly what I needed to install a 12vdc dash socket . Note that the wire leads are at least 10ga , so you will need larger connectors for this . Real heavy duty construction .
5 #### Beats pales in comparison . Do n't buy the hype . Buy what studio musicians use .
5 #### Great product , durable , fits perfectly , Brooks Mays is an dealer . Thank you .
5 #### One of the best Bluetooth I come accross . connects very quick . It also tell you when it is connected and disconnected ( voice activated )
5 #### This is an essential product for a band teacher who provides reeds for the students to buy . He still subsidizes the cost but it is so helpful to save time , gas and money by having these quantity packs delivered to our doorstep .
5 #### Love these , good size , bought a second set for our boat trailer .
4 #### This digitizer was easy to install , and it worked great . It was exactly as described , and I got everything it said it was .
5 #### These really work in my area to extend my bars
1 #### I m not an expert , I can only give a review based on the experience I had . It was disappointing that the fittings did not come with the part . I can understand that different application require different fittings , and that the price point is possibly low enough to but fittings separately , however , I still fault the product for not having generic fittings that work in most cases . Sourcing fittings was more difficult than buying the regulator . Furthermore , the regulator did n't change my pressure based on the meter I was using . Maybe it was broken , maybe it was user error . Either way I purchased another product to solve my problem .
5 #### Excellent CB .. easy to install and use.[mounted in the console].I'm not a CB user mainly on road trips . I tried a couple of different brands the same size did n't get good reception .I thought it was my Antenna [ 4 ft Firestick ] . Turns out the Uniden has alot more Signal Power ... I was impressed with this unit ...
4 #### It 's a cord , it works . I bought it because because I wanted to have different colored cords for all my devices and it was not overly expensive .
4 #### Fine for what we needed it for . Husband hooking up new horn on his motorcycle and or course extra stuff is needed to complete the installation .
5 #### I ordered this Odyssey PC545 battery as a replacement for my VTX 1800 . It arrived in time , well packed , too . According to the manual it was pre - charge . So I took the old battery out and compared them . It was supposed to be a direct replacement . Unfortunately this Odyssey is about 3/4 " smaller in hight . In my case it did n't make a difference - be aware if you use this battery and expect it to be the same size . Other then that it was a simple swap . It does have more CCA then the original battery . The mounting points for the cables are well constructed , even thought the supplied bolts are somewhat short . If you have more then just one connector per side you might need to look for longer bolts . Again , simple swap , hooked it up and it worked . I am very happy with the battery . Well , since it starts the bike , gives enough juice to power all the additional equipment - I did n't notice much difference . Time will tell if it holds a charge longer then the old battery ( and that 'll be easy ) Cliff notes : easy replacement , slightly smaller , well constructed connectors , short bolts Thx FrankEGD
5 #### its a patch that goes over the spot where your beater beats on the bass drum , guess it provides some useful purpose like kicking thru a bass drum skin , came with a few which is nice , price was right , so why not ... go for it ! ! !
5 #### I 'm using this product a lot with my printer to label our electrical panel and switches and outlets . The adhesive is good , and the material is tough enough for the job . On my printer , the resolution of the print is acceptable , especially for 1x1 font size with outline lettering text style .
5 #### Arrived quickly despite where it was shipped from . It 's small and it opens up any iPhone . Definitely recommended for anyone who needs a key for the sim tray .
5 #### Excellent product - in 10 years I have only replaced the batteries three ( 3 ) times ! ! ! That other fellow had to have had a defective product - should have gotten a replacement . Only radio in the house that tunes in C - SPAN radio 90.1 near Washington , DC . Used it during the huge blackout in northeastern US summer of 2003 . Comes in handy on holiday in the Adirondacks when the power goes out around the lake . Have to say that I own SONY everything - they never wear out , especially picture tubes going on 20 years . Why ca n't all companies be like that ? ! !
5 #### I need to attach netting to a balcony rail and I wanted it to be reasonably price and easy . These fit the bill for the narrower spindles and rails . They seem to be high quality and I expect them to last . I 've used some of the bigger , heavier black ones for larger balcony rails and to attach chicken wire to a metal gate outside . They all work just fine , and I 've already ordered more than once . Will definitely keep buying this brand .
5 #### You can compare this to a pearl or any other popular stand , your just not going to have the pay that hi price try it you 'll like it !
5 #### Very affordable and durable . I had to buy this because my " Canon imageCLASS LBP6000 Compact Laser Printer " does n't include the USB cable . Does n't get damaged permanently when bent for too long , unlike other USB cables .
2 #### Looks cool in the pictures , looks totally different in hand . Snaps on to my iPhone good enough and offers adequate protection of the back and corners . That 's all I wanted because I 'm careful with my phone , it 's just a small insurance policy that I though would look cool and match the style of my MacBook Pro . Wrong . This thing is cheap plastic that has poor finishing . Bits of plastic hang off the edges and I needed to " tidy up " the edges with nail - cutters . There is no " shimmer " to it like in the photos , so it does n't even look CLOSE to aluminum . I knew it was plastic , but the photos make it look much better than what it really is . I gave it 2 stars because it fits well and was posted quickly . The looks are a huge downside .
5 #### I had an issue with my new Squire Guitar , and Fender hooked me up with a set of these . The String Ends have a Cylindrical or Bullet Shaped end , rather then the typical small loop . The theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity . I say they sound great and are worth trying . I just order 3 - packs so I can have some on hand .
5 #### Great cheap CB for your Jeep . Installs quickly and easily .
1 #### This item is bad very bad -big problem to separate layers of clue cover and the top plastic , I do think it is very old item .
5 #### The Koss SportaPro Headphones are terrific . They are Lightweight and can be worn over or behind your head as described . These phones are fully adjustable for different head sizes . The cord is 4 feet long . Sound quality is fabulous . When you consider the low price , these headphones are a truly an amazing bargin . You can not go wrong with this one . Highly recommended .
4 #### I love this mop . Er , sorry , " car duster . " Even though we are east of the 100th meridian , there is still a lot of dust settles in and around by garage . So , I saw this thing and thought ... hey , if it works in California , it ought to work here . It does . I 'm happy
4 #### Easy to use , spring is very strong . Would not recommend for nylon strings . Good value and works well .
5 #### worked great with my nokia phone for a very long time . great sound quality and probably competitive with more modern headsets if I still had it . After a long time with a lot of use , i broke it . would definitely recommend .
5 #### I saw the name Quick Detailer and thought this would be a good product to use between my " deep cleaning " full wash and detail but I 've been amazed at how long the shine lasts ! It went on easily and and left a great , consistent shine ( without swirl marks ! ) and even worked on some grimy dead bugs on the front bumper . This is quickly becoming a favorite for me !
5 #### I purchased this unit for our family boat . Like many typical families everyone has a smart phone , but only my phone gets plugged into the stereo and is charging while we 're boating . Often times kids and friends ask me to disconnect my phone , but then I loose the use of my navigation app and it 's a pain having people reach over me while I 'm operating the boat so they can see their notifications . To solve this problem I started looking for a USB charger on Amazon and found this device . Installation location was the key to making this thing valuable . I did n't want another place for people to try and charge their phones where it was in the way , and I did n't want them out in the open hopefully encouraging them to enjoy the boat versus blue facing . I installed the device in the glove box area on the port side of the boat . When someone wants to use the charger they can put their phone in the glove box , and then close it to keep it safe and dry while it charges . Installation was pretty easy , drill a big hole and wire it up to 12V. I 'm just hoping it works correctly and does n't short out . Taking a long trip with the boat so I 'll report if it works anything less than perfect .
5 #### For cheap headphones , these are a pair that I really do n't want to be without . I keep a spare set , just in case . I wear BTE hearing aids , so these headphones will fit right on top of the aids , just above my ears , and they 're still very comfortable . The foam cushions help drown out a bit of the background noise and the earphones work with my hearing aids to give me as good a range as digital aids with music is going to get . It 's not perfect , but it works quite well . I ca n't speak for how these sound without hearing aids , since my hearing is so bad that I ca n't hear them at all without the aids .
5 #### I 've had this router / switch for a couple of months and it does the job . Very easy setup for Mac ( although I had to call tech support , as the manual only addresses PCs ) . The device serves my computer , Netflix Roku player and Xbox console . One time the signal stopped and I had to unplug / plug in the device to reset it . Then I found out there 's a reset button in the back of the router . A friend said it 's not unusual to do an occasional reset . But that was the only one so far .
5 #### I do n't use tapes too much anymore , since the advent of DVR recorders . I do have friends that do n't have a DVR 's therefore I copy things for friends . Maxell makes a good tape for this purpose .
5 #### These are fantastic filters , but just make sure you get the right one . I accidentally ordered this filter for my 2007 G35 SEDAN , when this is for the COUPE . Returned and got the right size filters no problem . Thanks Amazon and K&N !
5 #### This fuse was needed to install an inverter system for emergency power outages . We had 4 different utensils plugged in and the fuse did not blow !
3 #### Works as it should . I use it for my mouthpiece and neck . I have one of those long fuzzy things for the horn body .
4 #### This thing is heavy ! ! ! so heavy that when it was shipped to my place , the box that came with it could not hold the floor jack and things were poking out of the box . All the styrofoam inside was squished and torn . I feel sorry for whoever is carrying and shipping this thing . I know I would hate it . I ended up with some minor scratches when receiving , I didn"t mind . its going to get scratched up anyways in my garage . Besides , you could repaint it if you really really want it that nice looking . Used it a few times . works great like its supposed to on my 1998 Toyota Avalon . This seems like it will last me forever . Great buy if you don"t have one .
5 #### I am happy with the screen savers . Once they arrived I watched a few installation video 's on line ( I just googled how to install screen savers ) . After watching a few videos I installed the screen saver . It turned out very nice . I feel much better knowing my screen is protected .
5 #### Hi , I was thinking or not to buy this lights after all the complains I read , but , using the little thing I have inside my cranial cavity called brain and after a lot of people not using it , complaining about they are not water proof I re - sealed them just in case , it 's something who every one can do , I 'm from another country and do n't take me long to figure it out , means , anyone who buy this lights can do the same is really not hard , silicone , liquid tape , etc , will do it , just use your brain and do n't complain about something that basic . now , If you want just buy PIAA for 3 or 4 times the price , sealed until the end of times and etc , I do n't want to expend that money in lights , just follow the instructions , they are good and nice , solid , well made and inexpensive compared with another brands . off course you can buy some lights for 10 to 30 bucks but is nothing special in them , and I do n't know if they will work for long time or not
5 #### They 're heavy , sturdy , and the best picks to use for rock and intermediate to advanced players . I know beginners like to use softer picks .
4 #### Good little antenna . I get more channels than I did without it . When you are dying for any new in English when you are in the God - forsaken nowhere lands of the world , this is super handy . Does what it is supposed to do , and that 's really all you want in something like this , right ?
5 #### I just picked up a 2004 Yukon Denali and thought this may dress it up a little bit . Took drill and bits over to do the install only to find out there were already 4 square holes in under side of hood ( lip ) to install the included screw snap - ins . Took maybe 3 minutes to install the shield . NO TOOLS required . Simply push in the inserts into existing holes under hood - hold up shield and put screws in through supplied rubber grommets . Great price / SIMPLE install / Looks Great .
5 #### I purchased the Gator GK-2110 for my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Boss - RC-300 - Loop - Station / dp / B005P4NVJI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Boss RC-300 Loop Station</a>&nbsp;and for a small keyboard in the future . I chose this over Gator 's Multi FX bag because it was a better fit lengthwise for my pedal . It 's interesting that the tag on the bag states that it will fit controllers up to 21 " x 10 " x 5 " . My pedal is 21 1/8 " and fits fine . One minor complaint I have is that the shoulder strap adjustment buckle prevents you from placing the pad in the middle of the strap if you tighten the strap from just before medium to " tightened all the way . " This is not a big deal to me , because I can sew / create a better strap system . I have an&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Akai - Pro - MINIAK - Virtual - Analog - Synthesizer - with - Vocoder / dp / B002MAAW4U / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Akai Pro MINIAK Virtual Analog Synthesizer with Vocoder</a > , and this keyboard bag will not fit . I had to add that because I saw this bag " pop up " on the " What customers buy after viewing this ( Akai Miniak ) item . "
1 #### Works for about two seconds until it does the whole reverse tape side thing a couple times , and then spits it out . Not worth the money . Do some research and invest in one that works .
5 #### I 'm a huge fan of D'Addario strings . They hold their tone & tuning longer than others I 've tried , and when you buy the bulk packs you ca n't go wrong on quality + value .
5 #### The formatted size of this card is 121 MB only , not 128 MB . Maybe Viking is using the same calculation as in other storage devices like HDD ? Anyway , on my new Canon PowerShot G2 , it can store 42 RAW images . It is not bad . Remember to calculate the price / MB ratio : It is very close to 340 MB microdrive . Moreover , solid state device ( RAM ) is always faster than mechincal devices ( HDD ) and draw less power . I personally choose this because the price and performance is right . Other sizes ( 64 MB , 256 MB , or microdrives from IBM etc . ) are not as good as this ... as of today , of course ( 10/23/01 )
5 #### Had it a couple of months , so far so good ,
5 #### These are incredible headphones . It 's possible to get better sounding headphones , cheaper headphones or headphones that are more comfortable , but it 's impossible to get headphones that beats the HD 600 on all criteria . These are the headphones that music lovers can comfortably stay with for decades without wanting more . They may be the start of a great collection of exotic headphones or the only one ever owned , but IMHO any music lover must own one pair of HD 600 .
5 #### Excellent mic , super durable . I recommend getting the one with the on / off switch so you can cut it in case of feedback .
5 #### Outstanding product and does the job just fine . Bushwacker flares cost way to much for me to spend so i considered going this route and i am a way satisfied customer . the great thing about this product is that because it is flexible you can fabricate the looks to exactly how you want it even for off road purposes !
5 #### I 've been getting these since they came out . Oddly enough , the last set I stuck on my wife 's Alvarez was back in the late 90 's . 1st and 2nd strings were kind of corroded ( it 'd been sitting in the case the whole time ) but the four lower wound strings were still bright and clean .
5 #### this speak is very good and I think people will appreciate it for the price aloha ......... drom hawaii
5 #### Kyser makes a great capo . I have a bunch and have given them as gifts . I like the bright colors , because I tend to lose things , and the color appeals to me anyway . I have 2 year old son that also loves capos- not for guitars , but all sorts of things that you might think would ruin it or scratch it , but nothing seems to do any damage . I do n't even worry about it any more . And they do n't damage the guitars , they 're super easy to use , they look good , they keep me from even having to try to think about what I should do when I ca n't sing as low as a song is written ( seriously that 's THE BEST part for me ) , and you can get any color or even a pattern . Excellent product .
4 #### Do n't know if I like this one better then the pin style . Time will tell .
4 #### Bought one for my driver side , liked it so much I got a second for the passenger side . NOt as useful on the passenger side obviously but I definitely appreciate the extra view on both sides . This fit nicely on the outside bottom edge of tacoma mirrors . You can not put these in the inside edge ( I tried ) because they are not evenly convex like a circular mirror would be . They are curved out from the corner to the round side so the corner always has to be away from where u are trying to view .
4 #### I liek the slider on this phone , for me the buttons are ok even tho i have very large hands
1 #### Both that I bought split on half after a year . OK for 6 bucks each that I payed . Not 15 as it is now listed
5 #### Yes , it makes my Droid Incredible a bit thicker . I admit that concerned me when I first though about buying this . But actually , that does not bother me at all . In fact , it makes the phone fell even more solid and easier to hold . Not an issue as far as I am concerned . But what I love is that I can use all the features of my phone , as much as I like , and never worry about the battery . Never . With moderate use , it will last days . Not hours , as with the original battery , but days . Texting , using the phone , watching video , playing games , reading books ... whatever ... and still lots of battery left at the end of a long day .
4 #### I 've been using Arkon products for years and they 're my go to company when I 'm looking for phone mounts for the various cars and phones that I 've had over the years . I bought this mount because of the 5.7 inch Moto X Pure phone that I purchased recently and it was simply too big for my other Arkon mount . Pros : Design : It 's designed for larger phones . It 's ability to expand horizontally is ideal when you have a larger phone or a phone made larger by a case . Suction : Strong suction . Holds big heavy phones with ease . Price : I think the price for it is reasonable and equitable . Cons : The Phone Mount does not hang low enough from the suction appratise : There might not be enough clearance between the top of the phone and the windshield . If the phone is taller than 5.4inches , there 's a good chance that really have to squeeze the phone into the mount because there might not be enough space . It my case , I have to turn the phone horizontally .
5 #### This is just what I needed to adjust the volume of my headset . Keep in mind that the control may not be located where you can reach it handily .
5 #### Works great so far , very happy with time for shipping and it plugs into USB a huge plus while on the road with laptop .
5 #### Couples perfectly with a standard 1/4 " cable to my BOSS DD-7 for tap tempo ... love it .
5 #### These mirrors are great , adjustable to fit on the size of mirrors I have on my truck , easy to clip on also .
5 #### Thank you Amazon . Oakley does not sell these cases any longer and they have always been my favorite . My wife and I have reading glass cases with bad hinges and I found these on Amazon . Love em !
5 #### Bought this for my girlfriend so she would stop cooking her legs . She says it works perfectly and keeps her legs cool .
5 #### Great duster for the interior of any automobile . High quality and should last for years to come . Great price .
3 #### Bought this to charge my iPhone 4s in the car . It works , but seems to work very slowly . As long as you 're in for a good long ride , I suppose it does n't matter how fast it works !
4 #### Great for the price . Do n't be fooled , there is n't any " padding " , but it is a thicker canvas than a cheaper gig bag would have .
5 #### I used this to clean my Horse Tack .. Do n't have Horse 's any longer but I do have a new couch and three Dogs that compete with me for a spot on it . So yes , this stuff is great and a must in my situation .
5 #### Love this battery , definitely an improvement over the original one . I can now go a full day without having to plug in , even when I 'm busy playing on it !
5 #### Excellent case . My bass fits perfectly inside . There are two " pockets " for holding strap or other loose gear and when the case is closed it completely covers them holding the loose stuff in place . The internal padding actually compresses against the guitar with a tight fit . I 'm sure that it will provide excellent protection against drops . I 'm actually thinking of switching my Fender Guitars over the Gator cases now .
5 #### I was told I did n't necessarily need the L serious version , and I 'm happy I bought this . It gets really close to the subject , wish i could of taken the pics a little further away , that way some of the critters wo n't get scared and fly away .
5 #### Fits nice and snug . No problems installing or removing . I have done this several times without scratching or cracking anything . Not sure why others are having problems . Seems pretty straightforward to me . The black is only on the outer casing . Inside is white plastic as is some of the edges . Was easily fixed with a black marker . Highly recommended !
4 #### Used these to install 1 inch pucks in the rear of my 2014 JKU . The compressors have a channel that is correctly formed to hold the coil , regardless of where you place it . The wrench end goes up . I used the weight of the vehicle to compress the springs to save time .
5 #### The review by Ben Ice that states that all unlocked iphone 3gs are jail - broken is totally false and misleading . Yes you can get a jail - broken phone but if you get one that was a previous ATT off contract phone and there is no outstanding bill on the phone , ATT will unlock it for you , hence " factory unlocked " . The phone can then be used legally on any GSM carrier . As of Jan 26th 2013 no phone will be unlocked sold after that date as a law was passed , however anything sold before that date can be legally unlocked . As to warranty , I do not understand why it was even posted as an issue because most people buying used phones do not expect warranty anyhow . The iphone 3gs is still upgradable to the latest IOS and runs just fine . It has almost all the same features as the newer iphones and is probably one of the best values in used phones available . I have had many iphone 3gs as well as Iphone 4 and 4s that are off contract ATT and they are unlocked and work on any GSM carrier and are all factory restored software . When you jailbreak a phone you alter the phones software and if there is a warranty it is voided . If you factory unlock a phone it in now way alters the software and is legal and the warranty is intact .
5 #### handy little kit to keep the filters running good . simple directions and easy to clean . this is a must for anyone using these cold air filters
2 #### The sounds are only good for the initial tuning but no good for fine tuning . If compared with an electronic Boss TU-12H tuner the sounds are off . I bought 4 of these pitch pipes they are all off one way or the other .
5 #### The price was right compared to local trailer parts store .
5 #### Not sure what could go wrong with a USB cable but it worked with the printer as expected . Cable quality good and looks like it should last longer than the printers usually do .
4 #### The " newest model " is the Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight , and not this model . It may be the newest without a light , but it 's not the " newest " .
4 #### This case fits well , offers good protection . I put 4/5 stars due to the button covering . The power button / volume gets harder to press . I got used to it right away but my gf with the same phone had to give it 5 attempts before she figured out why the screen was n't waking up . & This case WILL leave a diamond pattern on your battery case . that being said I 've had several drops and no damage to the phone itself this case took all the hits , good for the price
5 #### We carry when we are outside our pilot cars to talk to the truck driver while helping to park or manuver a oversize load . Some states require us to have a handheld CB so I pick the best . the price on amazon is the best any where . I would recommend the cobra to any one .
5 #### You really ca n't beat the sound of the headphones for the price . They fit really well , sound amazing , look sweet and rival higher end headphones . I am going to pick up a set for work and home . Even though they are portable , I still forget them . :)
5 #### This is a must have manual for any car owner . Just buy the one the is specific to your vehicle , obviously . This is very detailed and walks you through how to fix , repair , or replace almost anything on your vehicle . pictures are black and white , and a little grainy but the explanation is very simple to follow . Maybe new versions will have better picture quality , but it 's not enough for me to deduct a star .
4 #### Item was nice , but ended up not fitting our truck had to return it .
5 #### Always liked Hosa cables . Good sound quality and these jumpers are thin and flexible .
5 #### Awesome little gadget ! I bought a few of the other kind for my family & friends & they love them so I now know what to get as stocking fillers for Christmas for the rest of my friends with phones .
5 #### If your a dust nut like me , every few days 5 seconds sucks all off dash and instruments
5 #### Very strong battery . Heavy but starts my aircraft engine with an eight foot battery cable . My last one lasted 10 years and 7 months .
5 #### High quality strings no doubt . If they 're good enough for the likes of Mr Clapton , Mr Page , and Mr Young you KNOW it 's a great string . They stay in tune and settle into the nut nicely ... you never hear that " tink tink " noise when re - tuning . I use 009s on my Strat and Tele ... 010s on my Les Paul . Being an SRV fanatic , I took the dive and tried the Not Even Slinky strings ( 012 - 056 ) . I put those on my Strat and had the guitar re set up . Here 's my thoughts . Much deeper booming sound . Bending the G is very difficult . I play a lot of blues , so I am bending the G constantly into a barred B and high E 2 frets down . ( Classic blues lick starter ! ) . I was fighting bends and could not get much post bend vibrato . I have very low action on my Strat and it still was a fight all around . Not the strings fault at all ! It 's my lack of finger strength as I 'm in my 50s now . Really enjoyed the sound of the booming chords , though . Going back to 009s on the Strat . I have even more respect for SRV now ... he played with 013 - 060 strings ! Just beware what you are getting into if you go for the bridge cables .
5 #### For some reason I thought these picks were going to be flexible . They are not at all , kinda like glass . That being said , I love these picks for Bass . No harsh sound that a regular pick makes with bass . Sounds very much like a finger . Super easy to grip & hold on to . I got 6 purple picks , maybe those are the color of the 3.0 's . They sounded horrible on acoustic guitar but very good on electric guitar & electric bass . Nice sharp edges for such a thick pick . They turned out to be much better than I expected . Quality & great price ! ! Joe
5 #### I was a little skeptical about this , , but ordered it to go with my ipod and blackberry , and laptop . the unit feels very substantial , nice neoprene case . the sound I heard when paired it with by blackberry 9700 , was superb . It 's nice to sit outside or wander around the house with this unit . nice sound , pairs easily . I use it alot with my blackberry 9700 , with slacker radio , streaming on this . Nice job Blueant , think I will order another one for my college going daughter . One note , when streaming internet music , make sure to enable blue tooth transmission in the streaming application , or it will shut off after every song . I love this speaker ....... canoeman
5 #### Very clean sound , comfortable to wear for long periods . I use them for video editing . Audio is the most important component of communicating via video , and these let me hear exactly what I am working with . Highly recommend .
5 #### Brilliant idea ; wish I 'd stumbled upon these before the drunk crashed into my old boom arm and spilled beer all over my stompboxes . Admittedly , the geared wheel takes a little getting used to , especially if you 're sharing the mic and need to reposition it . But it 's secure , and well worth the extra step of loosening to adjust . I bought two and my buddies each bought themselves one -- as should you !
5 #### This product is GREAT ! I retro - fitted my 1990 Camry from R12 to R134 . Originally , I looked up the specs for my car and it said to use 26 ounces of refrigerant . It was warm as hell and I was very disappointed . THEN , I went to a few blogs and was told that when retro - fitting from R12 to R134 you must put MUCH less refrigerant . I experimented . It is the COLDEST with ONE can of refrigerant , which is only 12 ounces . When you retrofit , do NOT overfill with refrigerant . Even the manufacturer says to use 80 Per Cent of what your original R12 system took , but even THAT much is too much . Put one can in and try your AC first . For my 1990 Camry , it is coldest with one 12 ounce can .
5 #### Works as expected . No issues with it so far . Directions were easy to follow .
2 #### These things do n't last long and you ca n't replace the battery . Great sound quality just made like crap . Not that durable .
5 #### It is so nice to have 20 ft cables . With the cheap jumper cables you have to park right next to the car to be jumped . At times that is not possible . It makes you really appreciate the length of these cables .
5 #### This is a nice hardcase for the money . Its a little sturdier construction than most hard cases in this price range . Its got the typical black vinyl covering and yes it will rip if you snag it on something or drag it on the ground . I see people complain about this in the reviews , but that 's what cases are for , to take the dings and marks so your guitar does n't have to . Just do n't abuse it and you 've got a nice looking case that will last for years . I 've also seen some reviews comparing this to the Gibson Les Paul cases ( made by Gibson ) - not a fair comparison as I 'm not sure its quite that deluxe but its nice and sturdy and more than enough for your everyday use . Keep in mind the Gibson cases sell for no less than $ 125 and often retail for much more than that and are a bit heavier duty . This is almost half the price and still super nice . As someone who knows guitar cases I 'd say this is a nice one and fits well and snugly , guitar in question is an Epiphone LP Standard PlusTop Pro . Recommended !
5 #### I 've been using this stuff for years . Oddly Walmart does n't sell it in this kind of bottle anymore , only the spray ones etc . I prefer this type because the spray on kind does n't seem to last as long . Maybe it 's too watered down or something . Anyhow this stuff works awesome , I normally apply it before any trips of distance .
1 #### Ok its just a pen , it does n't have to be fancy , right . The plastic tips on the end are the problem . For one they are just pushed on as easily as they fall off . And second plastic is very grippy , needed to be silky to slide across screen .
4 #### Counter to what the advertizement claims , this device does not work well in windy conditions . I called to different people at different times when it was a bit windy and none of them could hear me . Otherwize this headset works very well .
5 #### I ca n't say enough nice things about these headphones . You will not be disappointed . I 've had a pair for nearly 10 years and they are still killing it . Buy a pair now , or spend three times as much for essentially the same headphone .
5 #### Finished putting this product on my motor home . This stuff works .
5 #### this is the simplest change a ball system I have encountered . Love it !
5 #### I love doing car stereo installs . This is not sarcasm , I really do . Whenever I do a stereo , if it needs an adaptor / kit i go with METRA . They do exactly what they need to do , usually pretty simply .
5 #### The go to strings when all else fails . Its no wonder many guitars come stock with it . Great strings !
5 #### I bought one of these for a project guitar , I wanted something inexpensive that I could cut my losses with if needed . The first thing I did was take apart the enter guitar . Removed the electronics , pickguard , switch and pickups . I sanded down the neck to remove the little finish that was on there . I ended up coating the headstock and fretboard in spar varnish . I coated the back of the neck with about 7 coats of laquer and sanded with 2000 . I replaced the pickups with a PAF style pickup in the neck and a hot single in bridge . I installed a 4 way switch which splits the coils on the neck pickup when in the 3rd position . I replaced the nut w/ a tusq nut . I replaced the tuners w/ some tuners I had from an american strat . Once it was all put back together I ended up having to recrown some frets because they were in a poor condition and some needed to be filed . Over all , I spent just under one hundred dollars for parts and about 10 hours of work on it . In my opinion it does n't play any worse than my american tele deluxe that I sold over a year ago . I keep the guitar in open G tuning and never goes out .
5 #### Many other spring - based capos are either too stiff or too loose . The spring tension on the Kyser is " just right" ... you can open it and slip it on the neck with minimal effort and be assured it 's going to stay put without slipping . Very well - constructed and ( providing you do n't lose it ) should last for many , many years . I do agree with another reviewer , the green version is a bit darker than the one pictured , but it 's not a deal - breaker for me .
5 #### If you 're like me and have a digital camera that uses compact flash and a laptop that always has a free PCMCIA slot , this is an excellent value . Leave it in your slot all the time , it wo n't have an effect on your system when the CF card is n't in , but it will permanently add a CF slot to your system . This means that you can dispense with the camera - to - computer cable and just plug the card into the slot . When you do , it will be recognized as a removable disk , kind of like a Syquest or Zip disk , and show up in your " My Computer " view or Mac desktop , and maybe ( this is how Nikon View works anyway ) pop up your digicam software . This really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptop .
5 #### Good product as usual from ZAGG , and I like the fact they include the liquid in a small spray bottle as a kit .
5 #### This is amazing ! ! I put on in my AimPoint sight , & it last for 5 years , WITH the thing ON ! ! ! WOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I just do n't know what else you could ask for in a battery ! ! !
5 #### This has a lot of uses beyond car applications . I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in - wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound . I used a sheet of it inside a computer case , to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on . You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter . It does have one drawback , and that 's the fact that once you stick it on something , you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess . It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover , and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind . So , choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down !
2 #### Have used for 2 years and am upgrading because I 'm too frustrated to continue with this phone ; the phone works well but it has other issues : texting cumbersome ( easy to hit wrong key on touch screen) .... but the worst is the email / internet access ! it 's AWFUL ( ca n't bring up Gmail saved emails ; forget opening attachments ! ; typed password to email does n't process well , needing several retypes ; VERY SLOW but it 's not a Smartphone and costs $ 15 less per month )
5 #### I love this talkbox . I had one once before but sold it cause I needed some quick cash . I had always regretted it so I bought it again ! That 's how much I like it , I 've bought 2 in my life . Drooling is an unavoidable situation this causes when you really get into it haha
5 #### It 's my second time buying this . D'Addarios are the best strings both in tone and in durability . The new packaging is well received compared to the old box . The vapor shield individual set packaging makes sure that even after a year , your strings will be factory fresh when you need it . I bought the ernie ball ( sale ) 10 set before and it tarnished on the 5th set of strings since it 's just packed in paper .
3 #### I bought the Tiki one too and I like it better . This one tends to collapse so I do n't use it much .
4 #### these work great . I was playing draw something all the time when I got theses . I now use them for various apps and activities on both my phone and tablet .
4 #### Happy w/ the item , seems to work . I did hit a porcupine , but it was my fault for not turning the deer alert on . duh . Lot 's of critters up this way and this item is a must .
5 #### Have not installed yet . Got these because they match my KC 121 130w spot lights , to round out a set of 4 . If they are anything like the 121 's I am sure I 'll be happy . A high quality product at a reasonable cost .
4 #### If you 're used to playing with nails , Alaska piks are one of the only options . They 're a bit goofy looking , but really do work well and sound great . Also , if you like flatpick / strum with your fingernail ( as I do ) then Alaska Pik 's are the ONLY fingerpick I know that works like your fingernail that way . You do need to order them on the smaller side - which is a bit uncomfortable - if you play hard and want to keep them on .
3 #### Have had just about every high end bluetooth ear piece out there including this one . It was just Ok . I did return it do to the fact that it did n't pair up well with the LG Dare and the voice commands were not that good . The best bluetooth ear pieces out there are the Plantronics Voyager 510 and the Plantronics Voyager Pro . Have had three 510 over the past three years with my family and just bought the Voyager Pro . Will continue buying there products . I use a bluetooth at least 8 to 10 hours every day and want them to do the job that they were intended for --- make and receive calls with voice commands and have the audio on both ends of the conversation good .
5 #### Battery life is great ! I use it for paintball and hunting . Look for my review on the radios , buy the Trisquares , I have tried many other products and these truly are the best . 1000 yards in dence woods with no problem . The VOX kit here works flawlessly .
1 #### This kit fit my car just fine but IT DOESN'T FIT THE STEREO ! It says it 's double din but it 's not big enough for a double din unit to fit in it . It took me a long time to get around to installing it and now I ca n't return it . Complete waste of money D : <
5 #### If you do wired networking , you will know that there is no such thing as too many patch cables . Usually the ones you have are much too long - hence my seeking & ordering these shorter cables . Certainly as good quality as any others ; and WAY WAY cheaper than I have seen in any retail store !
5 #### I know reeds and mouthpieces are very personal items , and so we should just go with what best fits our needs . Well , I 've been using LaVoz reeds for 30 + years , so I guess they do what I 'm looking for . I actually use these clarinet reeds for my vintage Buescher sopranos , and King Saxello , altho I sometimes use the LaVoz Soprano reeds , as well . Both are fine , and I also use & like using LaVoz on my Alto & Tenor , thus avoiding the buying , trying , & comparing all the newest and latest reed brands and styles syndrome ....
3 #### A set of instructions would have been nice , but I just ended up using youtube . The operation was a success nonetheless , still a great buy
5 #### Great remote . Cord is short , but great to have a wired remote that does not require battery to use for my macro photography .
5 #### About a year ago , I purchased a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera . The " wimpy " 8 MB CompactFlash card that came with the unit would only hold one ( 1 ) uncompressed , high - resolution picture - I needed more . I started looking and found this ; the SanDisk 128 MB CompactFlash . I read on the Nikon technical support web page that SanDisk is the OEM for Nikon 's CompactFlash cards , so I felt pretty safe selecting this card . The only question I had was " would my Coolpix 950 work with a card this large ? " The answer is a resounding YES ! ( according to friends , it will work in the new Coolpix 990 also ) The card formatted in the camera perfectly and has simply worked for the past nine months . I shoot all pictures in high resolution with a moderate compression level , allowing me to store more than 110 - 2.1 MegaPixel pictures in the camera - plenty for me . Recently , we took a five - day trip to Disney World - this card captured ALL of our pictures perfectly . If you get this , check out one of the USB card readers as well - the serial connection is just way too slow for transferring this much data . Executive Summary : Buy it now .
4 #### The headset works pretty well with my treo 755p . In fact , it 's the best headset I 've found for the treo ( tried plantronics and motorola previously without success ) . However , the ear hooks were missing from the package and Samsung customer service would n't even speak to me without me providing my phone 's ESN numbers . WTH ? I also attempted to make a request on Samsung 's service website , which also would not function correctly . I called Amazon CS and they sent a replacement after 4 minutes on the phone . AWESOME !
1 #### did not fit 2012 nissan pathfinder , just another product i m stuck with .
3 #### The kickstand works great , but the side buttons are a bit hard to press with this case . I have not dropped my phone with the case , so I ca n't say much about how well it protects against droppages .
4 #### Pretty good quality headphone , the flip mic / switch is very intuitive . Connection with two phones works as expected , though it has a notion of primary phone and secondary phone , so you might need get the wrong phone to call , when both are in vicinity . Great voice quality , good on power . I am a light cell phone user , so discount my opinion accordingly .
5 #### Excellent quality . ( Think some of the other reviews were not accurate , or maybe confused with a different cymbal stand . ) This one is high , heavy chrome , and sturdy ... Great stand at a very good price ! !
5 #### Anticipate a little bit of sanding when fitting this nut to your guitar . Graph Tech nuts are slightly oversized by design to compensate for measurement variables found from factory to factory . Also , this specific nut is best for pre-2014 Epiphone models . 2014 and newer models may encounter problems with the nut action being too low . This nut dropped right in to the slot on my 2006 Korean Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty 3 and only required sanding on each end to make the nut 's width flush with each side of the neck . Fitting this to my 2006 Korean Epiphone Sheraton II required a little more sanding . In order to fit into the nut 's slot the length of the nut ( where it meets with the truss rod cover ) required a little sanding before finally sanding the nut 's width flush with each side of the neck . I have been happy with the Graph Tech nuts I have purchased . They were easy to install , tuning remains stable and there is a noticeable change in tone focused on increased mid and high frequencies .

5 #### Used this for cloudy headlights and it worked really well .
4 #### I bought this tach to replace a Sunpro Super Tach that I bought in 1982 . That tach suddenly stopped working whenever I turned on the headlights . The new tach looks much the same but the markings are more refined with the graduations slightly harder to read . At night it lights up nice and bright but there are no light color choices . I had to go with this tach because the only place to mount it is the two o'clock position on the steering column . With this tach you can mount it off center and rotate the tach on it 's mounting bracket so it reads correctly . Other tachs I looked at have a mount that 's fixed to the bottom of the tach . I had some trouble hand tightening the knurled plastic mounting bolt at the back of the tach . Other than that it was a breeze to install . The tach comes with color coded wires that are permanently installed to the tach . I mention it because the old tach did n't come with wiring , you had to supply your own . Overall , I really like it and hope it comes close to being as reliable as the old one was .
4 #### Great fuse holder and wire . Just takes a few weeks to get it .
5 #### Excellent fast ethernet switch , works invisibly , just as it should ! ! If you only need a few ports this is a great way to go .
1 #### Very poor quality Cable Ties , not GB brand as advertised . I bought these about 6 - months ago for an Outdoor Antenna Project and just now got around to getting it done , too late to return them . Any amount of force at all and they just break , total junk !
4 #### Excellent bag , great quality , it has a shoulder strap , love this bag but it was to small for my macro lens and flash !
5 #### Great fan . Easy to store . Works great in my van application .
5 #### Item works as described and love how the clasp is strong and also not made of plastic where it bends .
5 #### Good strings . A little light sounding for my taste , but they are easy on the fingers and good quality .
5 #### i am very happy with the external battery charger . once fully chared , i was able to charg an iPad2 from 20 % to full and an Kindle from 15 % to full before it nedded re - charge . Charging iPhone did not use much power at all so i am sure it can charge iPhone many times before needing a re - charge . It is nice and compact and a great companion on the road as i travel a lot . i will recommend it .
5 #### Got this mostly to just monitor the traffic on interstate . Installed it in my new SUV and did n't want to drill holes or cut things . So this and a thru the glass antenna , the whole install looks great . This combination gets me just over a mile of RX / TX , quite pleased .
5 #### This does an great job of charging my samsung galaxy . They are both small enough that I have actually carried them in my pocket at the same time while it was charging . I get about 2 charges before I have to plug it back up to recharge . I have n't really used the laser pointer as I have no need for it .
5 #### Good cable , no drawbacks , works fine , clamps on firmly , not much to add here
3 #### I 'm confused . The product listing says UV resistant ( " Ultraviolet black ( UVB ) ties resist harmful light rays " ) . Thinking that that would mean OK for outdoor use ( silly me ? ) , I ordered a pack . Package now in hand , I see that it says , " Indoor Use " . Unfortunately , the Amazon listing did n't say " Indoor Use " and did n't show the package ( the only picture is of a single black cable tie ) . If the listing had included a legible photo of the package or described the cable ties as " Indoor , " I 'd have looked for different ties , ones explicitly rated for outdoor use .
5 #### Price was right and I highy recommend the product for all you leather products . I 've used product for years with no issue .
5 #### Hello , I purchase like a 3 packages of these item .. Why ? Answer : There are shippier , has a very very good quality , the company give us a great and fast shipping .. The screen protector works very good , the live of these product its aproximadly of 2 months with a heavy use .. I really recomendad these product
4 #### great step by step guide to building some pretty complex robots . great for beginners . my daughters 10yo and 8yo love it . could be better if the pictures were color , so it would be easier to figure out which piece to use .
5 #### It works like a cable you for which you would pay 30 times as much . Rock ON ! ! I bought a bunch for future use .
5 #### I put a aftermarket Dual radio in my Jetta and this was a perfect cheap harness I soldered in . The product is perfect Chinesium but that is really all you need in this case . What is more the company understood the ' K - line ' issue with aftermarket stereos and VW 's of this vintage and put in warnings with the harness . I was very impressed by that . If you are putting an aftermarket stereo in your VW use this harness and do n't solder straight to the car .
4 #### A little tricky to master [ there is a technique ] but works very well . Ring it out when it starts leaving water behind . I 've had mine for about 1 - 1/2 years and it 's still fine . Just remember to put it away damp . I think mine is ready for its ' first wash ... ha ha ha .
4 #### I 'm not one for detailed reviews as I have better things to do . However I do wish to add my 2 cents on it . None of the ear buds that come with it fit perfectly . The large one works , it stays in even though it feels loose , and for the most part is comfortable , even though it hurts like crazy after I remove it . Sound wise , It 's a little on the quiet side , but that might be my phone 's fault . Noise assassin works , as I was listening to a friend talk , they kept asking if I was still there ... even with my window rolled down some while driving on the interstate . It 's customizable as far as the audio prompts , " You have about tree hours of talk time remaining " the Mobster voice pack is the one I went with . Would I buy this again ? Probably , but I might go with a different model , like the Era or the Icon HD .
3 #### I bought this for my wife 's older model ( 2000 ) F150 . It was supposed to fit in holes that were already in the hood and it did . . . sorta . The holes in the deflector were " off " just a tiny bit and I do n't think it would have been a big deal except for the cheap little plastic screws / clips that are provided to attach this to the hood . They just would NOT hold the deflector in place . It looked nice on the truck and I wanted to use it so I had to scrounge around and find some other METAL screws that would better work to attach it . Once I found some , it went on fairly easily and solidly and has worked and help up well for the past month or more . It seems to be a well - made deflector , I just wish the company would n't " scrimp " on the cheap ( and weak ) plastic attachment screws . They make installation more of a pain than what it really needs to be .
5 #### Do n't understand the problems that other folks had . It is just memory and you should find out whether it is go / no - go right away . In this case , it is no fuss for my Olympus D460 ; it did not require formatting . Buy it You just can not beat the price of $ 32 and no shipping from Amazon.com ( for 32 MB postage stamp size memory ! I wanted to cry when thinking about the $ 500 that I paid for my first 40 MB external hard drive for my Mac ! ) .
5 #### I have been using it with my Acer C720P chromebook for about a month and have had no issues so far . It works well !
1 #### I was very excited when I first got this case . I loved the color and the feel of it . Then I started noticing stuff on my hands and realized the " rubber " peels right off the phone just from normal use . As the saying goes you get what you pay for .
1 #### I have iPhone 3GS in Outerbox protective case . This Armband Case is too small to fit with the Outerbox case and I do n't want to take the Outerbox case every time I want to use the Armband . Waste of money .
5 #### My experience so far with these strings has been very good . I put them on my ESP LTD - EC10 and they really made the guitar sound better . It sounds more like an expensive guitar now . I have tried Ernie Ball regulars and D'Addario lights . Both of those are good strings and I liked them both for different reasons . However these Gibson Vintage reissue take it to another level . My guitar sounds more full bodied , and beefy . Crisp and in stays in tune better than the other strings . The nickel wound strings are better than other nickel wound strings I have used , including the ones mentioned above . Gibson has a technique that is unique to their strings . I think it makes them a better string . They feel really good on the fingers . People say these strings last a long time and time will tell for me about that . I snapped a 1st string ( E ) right away when tightening it with my locking mini Grover tuners . It broke right at the tuner . But that was the tuners fault ( or mine ) not the string . I am going to order a couple more sets of these as I think they will be my go to string from now on . I like em . My wife noticed the difference in sound right away .
5 #### Yes , it fits Jeep Cherokee 2001 XJ . I have been usig the HP1 for a couple of years now . Allowing for more oil to be pushed up during cold starts
5 #### Works great at holding crank pulley in place while you pry on that darn old rusty crank bolt with everything you 've got for a good 10 minutes . Must have for Honda gearheads .
5 #### The fuel filter in my truck was going out so I saw this on Amazon and arrived on - time super easy install have yet to have a problem with it
4 #### sprays and brushes nicely , we 'll see how it holds up in the long run . looks pretty good on my bumper though
5 #### They are strong and work as advertised . I like them because they have a nice zip and hold tight when you tighten them down .
5 #### I was very pleased with the item as it arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting for what I had ordered ! ! ! ! !
4 #### This item came in a generic cardboard box , which was nice . I purchased it from BuyiParts . Make sure you order from a seller offering a warranty . The glass seems to be of good quality , and the screen is a refurbished original Apple screen . Only buy this if you know how to install it and are confident . It 's not the easiest repair job . Two issues : * The frame size seems slightly smaller than the original , which can be an issue for cases . * Item initially had a stuck pixel , but fixed itself after a few moments . o. O
5 #### What else can I say ? Personally , these are the best I 've used . Grip is impeccable and they 're pretty durable for the most part .
5 #### I 've owned MDRV6 for two decades ! ( or so ) and the model number is still the same and mine still look good and work perfectly ! Note that I 've replaced the ear pads once with soft - cushy velour ones from Beyer ( DT250 ) that are a good upgrade . Right now I 'm doing back to back testing between the the Sony MDRV6 ( 15 - 20 years old ) and a set of brand new Sennheiser HD 380 Pro . The Sony set wins . More comfortable . Quiet when bobbing my head whereas the HD380 's amplify a rubbing sound ( from the earpads ? ) . Sound wise , Sony is as good or better at high and mid range but I 'm undecided on bass ( sometimes liking one then the other better ) . Overall , I 'm keeping the Sony set . They are lighter and much more comfortable to wear which allows me to enjoy the musical experience more .
4 #### Case is good but the metal clip is not . I took the metal clip out and threw it away and I made a " homemade " loop belt ( see the picture below ) . If you do what I did , you will never loose the phone + case . Hope this helps .
5 #### After reading other reviews , I had some doubts . But I decided to give this antenna a try . Well , I am so glad , I took a chance . This antenna is amazing . Reception is perfect . It looks a lot more professional than magnetic antenna . Pros : Price - very reasonable . Easy to install - I had it installed in less then 10 minutes . Just make sure you have extra alcohol pads ready . The antenna comes with one and it is not enough . Cons : Instruction manual - ok , so it looks like the manual was written by someone who was either forced to write a manual or was extremely rushed . Maybe it was a high school project . But this is not a professional manual . Other than that , there are no complaints .
5 #### The original , if you are looking for one , why not get the best .
2 #### I realize this is apparently a very popular head . I 've been playing over 51 years and have had a l - o - t of snare drums and heads , especially in the past 10 years . I tried this on two DW snares and , soundwise , I might as well have been playing a cardboard box . Not much better on my DrumCraft . I realize lots of people are into near - field micing where you do n't really hear , want to hear or need to hear the same as acoustic playing . But I wo n't buy another of these . After much effort to try to like it , including removing the muffle ring , I cut mine up to use the mylar for other purposes .
5 #### This stuff is AWESOME ! ! ! ! ! I thought the bike was great the way it was , butonce i used this product on the wheels , the difference was like night and day ! The tires absolutely glow , they 're so clean ! I hope this product never goes away ! ! Goes on easy and with a minimum of elbow grease those tires will be looking perfect in no time ! !
5 #### I play drums in a band , purely as a " hobby " . We play a couple of weekends a month , all within driving distance . I had been using a hardware bag that I had to carry . I always dreaded having to load it in and out , not to mention picking it up off the floor . Then this rolling , upright bag came into my life ( cue the angel chorus ) . Not only can I load it and unload it without ever bending over , but when it 's loaded , I simply zip it up and roll it out to the van . I do have to lift it into the van , but if someone 's there to grab the other end , it 's easy . Even if there is n't someone to help , I can lift it for that brief moment easily enough . There are two sturdy handles on the front . This is a well - made bag considering the price . I wish I had bought one years ago ! My back thanks me every time we play a show ! I guess I should mention that I 'm into my sixth decade , but this bag would be great for a drummer of any age ! I also should mention that if you 're in a band that plays all the time and is on the road a lot , this bag may not be for you . If that 's the case , you should invest in higher - end , hard cases .
3 #### Unfortunately , not as good sound quality as what AT used to make in this price range . Better than the bargain - basement cartridges included with most turntables though .
4 #### Delivers extra power when needed , but it is is too heavy and the HTC M9 gets be very hot when it is charging sometimes . Update : It does n't charge the phone to 100 % . I only get between 75 to 90 % if I do n't use it all all during charging . Second update : Since I am having problems with my cellphone , I can not say it is the cover 's fault .
5 #### Very good performance ! ! ! ( And rare to find it in black ! ) .
5 #### Ideal for the car ! You can connect your cell , tablet at the same time . Extra room for your peripherals . Great .
5 #### Works very well no problems . Does what it 's suposed to do .
1 #### I believe this product will be good for me , if I ever receive it . Have made several attempts to contact the seller , and the only communication received from seller was to tell me it was sent , but no tracking number etc . and the item has not been received , even though the payment cleared my bank almost a month ago .
5 #### These are good velcro ties . They are basic ( but colorful ) solutions .
5 #### I have an AT&T HTC Fuze phone and the Jabra BT-3030 works perfectly with this phone . The earbuds are a lot higher quality than I expected . Several things impress me about this unit . The microphone on the dog tag picks up my voice very well , despite haning on my neck . The controls work very well when playing music on the phone . The distance the unit works from the phone is excellent as well . I am partially hard of hearing and several of the people I talk to using this phone are also hard of hearing , yet , they hear me quite well and I can hear them clearly and easily as well . I highly recommend this BT-3030 headset for anyone . I am ordering a 2nd so one can charge while I am using the other .
5 #### Really fine , well - balanced go - to drumstick , especially for quieter music styles !
5 #### These are lightweight , great rubber coating on them so they stay in your hands while playing . I have not dropped one yet ! They are also lightweight , so they are not as likely to damage my mesh heads on my electronic drums . Bought two sets !
5 #### This case fits my Iommi sig Epiphone SG perfectly . It 's nicely made and supports the guitar as it should .
1 #### Ca n't recommend these strings at all . I used to play these and liked the sound enough , but they break quickly . Never while playing but they 'd unravel overnight over the fingerboard , and that 's never happened with any other string . The last straw was when I changed the strings , played literally one night , opened the case the next day and the D and A had both unraveled . I play Pirastro Tonicas now , they have a darker tone that I like more , and they have never broken on me .
5 #### Used this for my Line 6 HD 500x . It 's somewhat of a tight fit , but it works !
5 #### This found and synced right up with the Moto Q 9c . The sound is clear and the mic does not need to be right up to your face . I thought the chain may be a little long , but the mic picks up the voice just fine . In a setting where the ambient noise level increases , you may need to bring it closer to your face to be heard . No delay like in some of the older BT devices . No echo either . Was able to use my own headphones without a problem . Utilizes bluetooth A2DP , so some of your BT devices may not see this . Check before you assume all BTs work with all other BTs , for that is NOT the case here . Namely the Mac does not work without some hacks or additional hardware . The clip is just okay . Not amazing , since it comes off and can only hold so much pressure . Not intended for hardcore use . Buttons feel solid and are big enough for large fingers . Backlight is pretty bright . I definitely recommend this device for your Moto Q 9c and other phones .
5 #### THIS IS MY 4TH UNIT IN THE PAST 3 YEARS . I GUESS I WEAR THEM OUT AS I AM ON THEM 12 HOURS A DAY .
2 #### I just received the film in a timely manor and was excited as my niece just told me she still had the polaroid camera I had bought many years ago . She said she looked for the film and could n't find . I jumped onto amazon and sure enough there it was . I bought a pack ( even though the price was crazy HIGH ) but hey it was for my niece BUT the experation date is 2007 so I think I will just return it after reading the reviews as to others who used the expired film and it was bad .. Not worth paying over $ 50 for .. I have a compact HP A646 printer for my digital prints and it 's GREAT .. I like to be able to view a picture before printing . between the ink and photo paper it 's about 30 cents a print and soooo easy .. Also small enough to take with you anywhere .. No computer is necessary , you just need an outlet to plug it in .. and within about 1 minute your photo is printed ..
5 #### Awesome hitch ! works great and does what it is made for !
5 #### I really quite liked these strings ! The action is great , they 're very easy to install , and the sound really superb . They 're a great price as well . I play in DADGAD tuning , so sometimes the Elixir a d'Addario have too much string , they tend to be a bit too thick , but these John Pearse are perfect for the style of guitar I play . I do have to change them somewhat frequently but not any more than I would with any other brand . These string record really well and I 've used them on several songs so far that I 've recorded . For any folk/ DADGAD/ drop D tuned guitar , I would definitely recommend these !
1 #### after wearing for a few mintues , i got blister and swelling ears . it has no insulator . it hurt the back of the ears so bad and that when i notice i have blister . i don"t know why motorolla called themselve engineer . you don"t need a rocket scientist to have some kind of pads or insulator to protect your skin
5 #### this was probably the best and only successful otter box ever . I just never liked any of the new models . If only they would go back to the basics and qauilyt material .
5 #### IF YOU CAVE A LOT ELECTRONIC WIRES HANGING ALL OVER HOUSE THIS IS GREAT WAY TO TIE UP YOUR CORDS AND ORGANIZE THEM FOR EASY TROUBLE SHOOTING
3 #### If you want more heavy duty get the 800 or 900 series PDP is a good product for price but if you play " hard " more than a beginner I would recommend spending a few extra $ $ for the 900 series hardware
5 #### Lately I 've been using Boomers as an alternative to EBs . I 've found that they work well and sound great . They hold up on a Floyd that gets a lot of use , so I 'm a fan . I have no problem other than I wish their packaging was a little easier to get into !
5 #### I 'm by no means a great guitar player . I would n't even say that I 'm okay . Bought this to learn on and so far it 's been a blast and I feel it was money well spent . I 'm using this with Rocksmith on the PC . Arrived packaged well and no dings or scratches on the guitar . The only thing I did though was throw on a different set of strings before playing .
5 #### I got these and they do a great job , I just purchased them a week ago , no problems yet , they hold up my 2010 toyota corolla when changing my oil . I was looking for a good price and good review Jack stands , and I found them to be cheaper on amazon then going to my retail store .
5 #### This cover is so well engineered it is very difficult to find a negative . Good looking , smart , sleek , magnet closures are brilliant ! ! You will not want to put your Nook down ! I ordered this for under $ 10.00 but I would have gladly paid full retail at $ 30.00 ! ! Of course nothing is perfect and the only negative is they really should have used 4 fasteners instead of the two to secure the reader in the case . If they had it would be perfect with with no comparison . I am not hard on any of my electronics ( iPads , Macbook , iPhone , etc ) so I have no fear of dropping or breaking my Nook , but not everyone is as gentle . I may order another just in case they go the way of the dinosaur ! ! This case is that cool I promise !
5 #### It worked well but alas my VHS player needed more that just a head cleaning .
5 #### Works great on my motorhome and made airing my tires very easy . Great product , it a must on the rv
5 #### I wanted the cable to transfer video from my camcorder to my computer . Cable works perfectly ... too bad I might need another one since my new computer has a 6 pin connection ... unless there 's an adaptor from a 4 pin to 6 pin . Cable is hard to bend , but it does the job . Better than paying $ 30 at Circuit City
2 #### This Premium Crystal Rubberized Hard Snap - on Case for Samsung Epic 4 G - Black , did not live up to expectations . The rubber material is too hard . The phone fell to the floor and the case break .
5 #### I love this mouthpiece . It 's sort of in the middle of the road as far as trumpet mouthpieces go . It 's high quality and sounds great .
3 #### First of i would like to say that the only thing this device has any sensitivity too is magnetic fields . I can barely get a reading for any electrical fields and i do get spikes of Radio wave frequencies , but its not accurate . Now for the price , i do not think this instrument is worth it . If this is the only device you can afford than go for it , but i found that overall this is the device that can give you all in one reading : however good luck on the accuracy of that . Price just is not right for this product .
5 #### have n't found an actual need for this but for the price I have had lots of fun just playing with it .
4 #### For the money , it 's O.K. Every time it is first powered up it is on channel 9 , otherwise , 5 stars .
5 #### Beautiful quality and outstanding product ! Everyone compliments me on the case and thinks I spent wayy wayy more than I really did :)
5 #### does the job , same as 5 x more expensive , do not waste your money
5 #### Needed a new one . Came brand new in packaging . Works great . Great buy for the money , great product , still use it today
5 #### The iTorch charges up quickly and was able to charge my new Samsung Galaxy S3 from about 15 % battery life to full charge three times before needed to be recharged itself . I also love the builtin laser pointer and flash light . Device is solidly built , packs a big charge for such a small device and I like that I can use my own single micro USB cable to charge the device and use the device to charge my phones and other devices . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### Great step , great price , matches my bull bar in front .
5 #### Good quality with excellent price I recommend it to everyone is looking for this product Thanks this will not be my first time :)
4 #### Ya I am das spindle vor keyhole prevention . Use me , work me ...
2 #### compact but troublesome to use , uncofortable in the ear and poor reception . I decided to give it away since it does n't function like it should
5 #### Great for organizing and keeping things where you want them .
4 #### The Voodoo 3 is a great card that replaces both your 2d and 3d card . As far as graphics go , it is only a little better than the Voodoo 2 . I did notice that the lighting effects are more realistic though . If you have a Voodoo 2 , then the upgrade may not be worth it unless you just want one card for 2d and 3d . Over all though , I think this is one of the best accelerators out there . The price is nice also .
5 #### Exactly what i was looking for and I knew it as I have purchased these here before , am very pleased as they were priced reasonably . Thanks , Mike
5 #### I 'm not a professional photographer , meaning that I do n't make money from my hobby . So I could n't see spending the money on the 100 mm L series so I purchased the less expensive 100 mm macro lens . Macro is one of my favorite photography genres and it is the main one I use when out in the field . So far this lens has not let me down . It is so clear . Now again , I 'm not a professional but even I can compare sharpness when compared to the kit lens and the macro lens . There is so much difference ! if you enjoy macro photography you will not be disappointed with this one .
3 #### this lens is very slow . it captures the light very well and is great when taking pictures of adults but not ideal for kids .
5 #### For any tech who knows shock hood props you ca nt truts this is just like vice grips but there s an plus some cars that come in the shop do n't even have a prop works great
5 #### Exactly as described . I bought these to put on my Grand Wagoneer . The stock mirrors are just too small and I wanted the old school look and the ability to see what is behind me and beside me while I am towing .
5 #### it 's for Nissan Murano 2007 - it 's a fit for it . Does what it said and well priced after MIR .
5 #### For 20 Bucks , you got to love em . Collapsible , great sound ( for the little bit of money ) , and , like their bigger brother the Porta Pros , you get a fabulous lifetime warranty , same large wide sound and portabilty . What more can you ask for ?
5 #### The best dang guitar picks you can get . Love them and have used them for many years . Oh , and they hold up . Just try to wear one out .
5 #### Since I began playing guitar I did n't think that picks were that important . Good guitar , good amp , and any pick you can find is great . I was incorrect . Having cheap picks break on me all the time was getting frustrating , and I wanted to find something that lasted . Finally after trying out some picks at the guitar store I finally found it . Dunlop Tortex .60 mm picks . Perfect for everything I could ever want or need in a pick . Never ever will I use ANY other brand of picks again .
5 #### It works great . i had one ethernet cable going from playroom to router ( next room ) and of course wireless was not enough and switching the cable from Xbox to pc to Chrome Book was an issue . i added this little box ( it took a couple of minutes ) and everything was running great . It may be an issue if you are running all at the same time but that not is not my case . Normally is one ( or two at the most ) running at the same time and I have not found any problems .
3 #### This mirror is just a tad too small and didsn't give me quite the visual range I was looking for . I got the larger one that I think is 2x3.and it works amazingly well .
5 #### i tried an electric pump and was really disappointed . not enough suction . this manual pump worked great . i changed the oil on my lawn tractor and outboard boat motor and it was a snap .
5 #### I find it hard to suggest improvements on any fender product I own , these picks are not to stiff nor to limber , I have used them for years .
5 #### Good strings , long - lasting because of coating . The polymer ( ? ) coating keeps gunk from gathering in the wrappings of the bronze - wound strings . Earlier versions of these strings got a little " shaggy " after a while ( i.e. , the polymer started to wear off and was visible as fuzz or tiny shreds hanging off the strings ) but these seem to be holding up pretty well , even the G - string ( no snickering , you 4th graders ) which I often pick with metal finger picks . Some players , perhaps with hearing acuity more refined than mine , say that the strings are somewhat less sharp - sounding initially than non - coated strings , but that they retain their new sound longer than others . I do n't notice the initial " dullness " but I do notice that they last a lo - o - o - o - ng time .
5 #### works well with my wah and it good for saving battery other than that its good to go no problems with it
5 #### Lexol was recommended to me by a car upholstery shop to condition leather . I tried it and it works great ! If you 're leather is very dry , it has to be used a few times a week for awhile to get the leather conditioned and soft again . After that , just maintenance is ok . So happy with purchase I ordered the large 1 - liter container to have on hand . I did use a microfiber cloth instead of the recommended Lexol sponge and no issues with the cloth , still worked great . Also , the smell is a bit strong and can stick to your fingers . I would recommend using gloves to apply and wipe off
5 #### Love this screen protector when I 'm out and about with no way to check myself !
5 #### To start with , I did n't buy this guitar because it was cheap , but because of the unbelievable reviews . I do n't know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past I have owned and sold my Gretch 12 , my Yamaha 12 , my ovation 12 , but I wo n't be selling this one . I 've had it for 3 months now and have n't adjusted anything , only played this $ 169 12 string from American Musical Supply / amazon . It is the best playing best sounding 12 string I have ever played period ... This guitar set off a couple of other Epiphone purchases ( 2 , one for my son ) AJ220SCE 's and ES-339 , Also great guitars . Most of my life Epiphones were dull over coated junk , not anymore , and it seems that Epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them . I own Gibson Studio Les Paul , SG , ' 87 American Strat , Martin D35 , Washburn Rogue , all nice guitars most for a LOT more money . This guitar is a NOBRAINER can not believe the value . American Musical Supply is also great , the first AJ220SCE came in with a bad neck and AMS emailed a return FedEx lable in an hour and after I dropped it off and it was logged in at a UPS outlet around the corner I got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way . When it arrived 3 days later it was a good one ! :)) 5 + star service .
5 #### D'Addario are great sounding guitar strings . Not too heavy , and not too light . They have really good presence , as well as a warm tone . Very responsive . I would definitely recommend them .
5 #### I have used this product for many years to grease the corks on my saxophones and clarinet . It works much better than any of the normal cork grease products you can purchase , as it does a better job of soaking into the cork to keep it moisturized . It only takes a couple of dabs of this on the cork ... then simply rotate your mouthpiece around as you slide it on the neck to spread it to the entire cork surface . I thought this product was no longer available ... until I saw this today ! Whew ... I'm back in business ! Highly recommended product ... based on more than 30 years of using it in the " real world " ! :-)
5 #### Nice tone but will update if stay good for long do n't know . Harmonics there good feel no dead spots and price good .
5 #### Room for large ( charging type ) plugs also . Company guarantees all of your plugged in equipment for full replacement should it fail .
5 #### I bought these to replace the horrible stamped sheet metal butterfly string guides on a 1992 Fender " Squier Series " Strat . While the butterflies would bind during large bends and any kind of trem use ( and often making that pinging / tinging sound ) , these American Series string trees have virtually eliminated the binding and tinging noise problem . Plus , they look much cooler than the butterfly guides . Were easy to install - just drilled a small hole 3 mm behind the screw hole to accomodate the little metal nubs on the bottom of these trees .
5 #### I have tried many types of steel strings . My Taylor 355 came delivered with these - and though I have tried several others , I have returned to them . Their ease of play ( smoothness to fret and finger ) and light but rich tonality makes them a good choice for your 12 - string . Have n't tried 'em yet ? Pick up a set - they ARE different and , in many ways , better than the more standard Phosphor Bronze strings that were the best before these came along .
3 #### The cable itself is fine and nice quality . It does not even charge my U900 phone so I"m not to thrilled with it ... dont have much use for it now .
1 #### I have not yet used this to replace timing belt on my 2004 Honda 3.2TL . In the image , the tool looks like it 's made of some resin but it is heavy steel . The hole inside is large enough to allow heavier - duty impact gun socket ( 19 mm for the TL ) . I checked the Honda SST and it looked almost identical . I will update when I 'm done with the job . When it comes to tools , I want made in USA / Japan but this tool is made in Taiwan so I removed one star . P.S ; after having used this , I have noticed that this does not fit snugly on 2004 TL ; there is a slight play and it marred the corners of the crank pulley . The actual size seems to be 55 mm . Genuine Honda tool comes with an adapter & a LONG bar ( longer than my Snap - on 3 ' beater bar ) .
5 #### I priced this in one of the cell phone stored in the mall . It was priced at $ 15 . I got it from the vendor for $ 4 ( including S&H ) . Looks good on my phone , and feels great in my hand . I highly recommend it . It was also delivered promptly . I was VERY impressed . Good job AMAZON ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Item arrived and described . It 's made by brother so I 'm sure I wo n't have any issues when the older cartridge rubs out .
5 #### I figured with such a cheap price tag that these headphones would be complete junk and would distort with heavy bass . However I was surprised at the clean and deep bass response and crisp highs . I am going to order another pair just in case I step on these and break them like I have done with my last pair of headphones :P
5 #### I needed something to help remove a 100 % silicone caulk from stained wood cabinet . Although this did not completely remove the silicone , it was better than everything I tried before . With that said , I am totally pleased with he product even though I have not used it for any other application as of yet . Stoner makes great products and I especially like their glass cleaner which is the only one that does n't leave streaks on the glass .
2 #### These are not good , so do n't waste your money . I only kept them because returning them costs almost as much as the dang things .
5 #### I 'm not typically the kind of reviewer who gives out 5 - star reviews like Halloween candy , but considering the fact that I was standing in front of pretty much the same cable for six times the price in a store , this warrants all the praise . Belkin is an outstanding brand , and this cable made its way to me in practically record time , factory sealed , and brand new . I have won the further admiration of my fiance , who is n't used to bargain hunting or deal seeking ( and was fully prepared to shell out as much money for a USB cable in a store as it would cost to eat at a fast food restaurant with our two kids . Highly recommended .
5 #### use it best on the photo punch android her app . i just needed one so shared other two with friends . worked well on galaxy s 4 and ipad mini
4 #### These are great for vacations . We got these for our cruise to the Bahamas and also for my husband while in Japan snorkeling . Quality comes out great for a disposable camera .
4 #### I purchased this a while ago and it worked great . It has been about a year and a half since buying it for my ion block rocker speaker since the first battery went bad . I am at that point now that I am going to have to buy another because the charge is n't holding well anymore but for the year and a half I had it , it worked great
5 #### DR bass strings stay in tune and last many nights of performing you music .
3 #### It was a nice case , protected well for a pretty minimal size , but within 4 - 6 months , the silicone edges had ripped / split at several corner areas . Replaced it with this : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T0DTM2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_52 and have been much happier .
5 #### All capos perform the same function but the Kyser capo allows quick changes and removal . It also works on both my six string and twelve string guitars .
5 #### installation was easy , seems to be very accurate and quick responding
1 #### Definitely not the right part Specs for the application were correct .. Wrong size , does n't fit the mounting bracket . Too late to return;Trusted the part to be correct - wo n't happen again . https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JMUZW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1
4 #### It works just as well as any brake cleaner in an auto parts store , but at a higher price . I have no complaints about its performance . It 's basically a spray degreaser if you 've never used brake cleaner before .
4 #### Okay , I am absolutely in love with this case . LOVE the colors , a very vibrant pink and the gray is a great combination . The feel of the case was what made me fall in love with it too . I was looking for a silicone / rubber case to give me more of a grip which this case did wonders for . The hard part of the case still had this almost rubber coating to the hard plastic which is the best of both worlds . BUT , i think i 've had this case for about a week or two now and the edges of the gray hard case on the back are starting to rub off ! The rubber texture on the hard case started to crack along the edges and you can actually feel it when your holding the phone . You can even rub it off yourself too . That was a little disappointing because i have n't had this case but for 2 weeks or so when my brother bought it for me . But other than that , the shipping was extremely fast ( next day for me ) and I would still definitely recommend this case for others . The issue with the back edges do n't bother me enough because overall this case is awesome !
4 #### I was very disappointed in the color . The case is nice . I was so looking forward to the dark purple . Instead the color was bright purple not bad , just not what I had hoped for . It serves the purpose and the price was right just now dark purple . If you plan to order just be aware it may not be dark but the quality is good .
2 #### I hve bought this one as a back up to an HX 550 I lost and it was horrible . Like a totally different manufacturer . I say avoid like the plague .
5 #### After owning multiple older Motorola models and a Plantronics ( dumped that one in a day ) , this 710 is the " Best of the Bunch " . Folks that I speak with find it much easier to understand me , and the noise cancellation feature must work a bit , because regular road noise is no longer complained about . Still , if a diesel truck is nearby , folks will hear it . I wonder about the new 715 ? Would like to give it a try too . My son has a 710 also , and I do get some echo when speaking with him . I am leery about trying the Jawbone , have heard too many fit issues . By the way I ca n't figure the person that complained about fit , I am 6'5 " and a large guy , the ear loop fits me great !
1 #### Might as well save your money and buy a new cd / dvd player . I have an imac and this did not fix my problem .
3 #### First thing first . Thanks to Ginny ' Man 's review , I bought this phone through Wirefly . After rebate , it was FREE , and I received a free Bluetooth headset . I had Sony Ericsson T637 with Cingular for the past year . When I switched to RAZR / T - Mobile , I was hoping that people could hear me better . Everyone complained that the background noise through T637 was unbearable . ( I live in NYC and I make and receive calls on the streets 85 % of the time . ) So far , they say they could not tell the difference between T637 and RAZR . HOWEVER , the incoming volume is definitely MUCH LOWER with RAZR than T637 . My Gosh , I have the volume to the MAX but I CANNNOT hear the words of people on the other end ! ! ! ! I am not into all the gadgets , and to me the most important feature of a cell phone is to make and receive calls clearly . I had owned many different phones but in terms of volume , Nokia had it best . Local T - Mobile customer rep said that Nokia has entirely different speaker system , and yes , they are the best in the industry . If you do not live in the City , I would assume the volume level might be good . But if you live in the City , I would avoid this phone .
5 #### These are nice to have so that you can switch out ball size quickly on a single hitch .
5 #### So you 're playing around with your setup and the 11 's are a little stiff on the bend and the 10 's are just a little week on the substance of tone and sustain on the high E , so you compromise . The D'Addario EXL110 + is just right ... like baby bear 's bowl of porridge !
5 #### Excellent plug for my snowblower . ! /2 the price the shop wanted for the same plug . Thankfully I got it before this years snow storms .
5 #### This is a fantastic easy upgrade for my motorcycle ( Harley ) light bulb . MUCH better over stock ! It 's pure white with just a hint of blue at the corners .
5 #### they work great and shipped fast . they arnt kidding when they say these are short though . they bare about an inch and a quarter tall
3 #### Will need to test function but not happy with how it arrived . Cig lighter plug was broken .
5 #### Even in the age of DVRs and Tivo some of us still use VHS to record our programs . This tape although still produced is hard to find in stores but Amazon supplies it . For years Maxell has been the best VHS tape and even though their product line has gotten smaller their High Grade line ( formally HGX - Gold ) are simply the best out there . Awesome picture quality that will look better than the original broadcast . Still use a monoral VCR ? No problem . Sound Quality in SLP mode is marvelous ( which is what I use because I want the maximum amount of recording time ) . I recommend the 8 hour length because of the extra two hours of recording time . I used to use TDK 8 - hour Hi - Fi or Extra High Grade tapes but TDK has stopped producing good tapes at long lengths so I moved to Maxell which is more than satisfactory . If you ca n't find these in stores buy them here .
5 #### I have a very heavy Guild 12 string and this supports it very firmly . It has made a big difference not having this precariously perched unsupported and slipping not infrequently . This product adds great support and security for one 's precious instrument .
5 #### Well made and very easy to set up . I really like the LED indictors , helped track down the correct cables since none of my cables have been labeled yet .
5 #### This replaces a mityvac product that quit working . It is much easier to use and clean . Excellent design and quality .
5 #### I 've tried a lot of USB lights and this one seems to be the best . It throws a wide angle light and the neck is stiff enough it stays where you put it . To test durability I set it up as a desk lamp and have had both LEDs on continuously for a little over two months . Both LEDs are still full brightness so it 's doing well in that test . Update July 31 , 2013 : After 5 months of being on continuously 24/7 both LEDs have gotten much dimmer . It 's still working but no longer bright enough to read by . For comparison I have LED under cabinet lights in my kitchen that are still full brightness after 8 years continuously on . So it does n't last forever . Oh well , what does ? I still think this is the best laptop light I 've tried and I will get another .
5 #### This product works perfect ... just as described . Quality is great . Shipped fast . I would buy this again . Overall , would recommend this again .
3 #### Good battery pack for traveling , but recently something broke inside and it rattles , which worries me , so it stays in home as a backup charger when the energy services get interrupted , and I still fully cycle it each month just for fun .
3 #### I bought this used . It worked - but I do n't recommend this for mac . The phone company was more than patient and I got it to work only with their help . But a power interruption had me re - installing it from square one . My internet problems went away when I upgraded to an entirely different system . I have n't looked back since .
1 #### This charger is useless to me . It wo n't stay in the outlet at all and does n't seem to charge two devices at once . I got what I paid for ....
3 #### It 's an okay product . You could probably make one of these , but at this price why bother . It works for shortwave , and is a decent little antenna for those that live in apartments or take their radios camping , etc .
5 #### price was right for what I am using the headphones for . Using them at work for employees to listen to training videos . Good sound for the price
5 #### I am very pleased with the improvement in sound of my father 's old student violin ( about 85 years old ) after I put on the Helicore strings . They are also much easier on the fingers and much more responsive than the student grade strings that were on it ( fairly new strings - not 85 years old ! ) . I am looking forward to seeing how well these strings last , since a lot of my playing is outdoors . These strings have a slightly different sound than the Dominant strings I have on another student violin I have . Both sets of strings make the student violins sound much better . I do n't really favor one set over the other - they are both pleasing , but do have slightly different tones . ( I 'm not certain how much difference is in the strings and how much is the difference in the violins . The next time I change strings , I plan to reverse which violin has which kind of strings to check this out . )
5 #### Hard to find any superlatives about a simple wrench . According the the 5 - star explanation , I " love " it . Well . . . . OK , I really like it , but true love may come later .
5 #### Using this product with an " iSimple IS31 Antenna Bypass FM Modulator for Factory or Aftermarket Car Radios " in my 2004 Chevrolet Monte Carlo . The connectors and insulators are burly and do n't appear to be easy to wear out or destroy . The length allows me to provide mp3 / iTunes integration to the head unit from any passenger in the front or back seats of the vehicle .
1 #### While I will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit . If you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times ..... but if you want to turn it off , that s a whole different story . Powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it . Add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function . I have FREQUENTLY called someone just by trying to turn off the device . The button is also entirely too sensitive . I 've had the device in my cargo pants pocket ( where this would be very little pressure on the device ) and the unit has turned on and actually called someone . Other issues are the charging indication is n't real clear and there is n't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device is n't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used ( its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money ) .
5 #### I like the phone because it is unlocked , arrived on time and met all my expectations . I really like the phone .
5 #### My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones . I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars . The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage . One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely , but works with the others flawlessly . I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues . I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it 's price . To me , the warranty is worth it because of the price . I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster 's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality , but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion .
5 #### I have been using this device in my home recording studio for about 6 months now . Without it , my vocals are bright and scratchy . This added warmth and gave my vocals a fuller sound . You must change the tube and it was n't hard to do ! Less gain gives you more warmth ! See how to change tube here : [ ... ]
5 #### Why did n't I think of this ? I used tie wraps then when I moved the computer I cut the tie wraps and redid them . Now I can add / remove the velcro ties easy ! then use them again .............. really a good idea to make life easier !
2 #### This did n't work well for my 12 string acoustic . It was n't tight enough to hold down the Low E strings . Got buzzes and muted string sounds throughout the fret board . Check out the Planet Waves NS Capo Pro 6 and 12 string . I really like that one . See my recommendation for that .
5 #### if your like me and you ca n't stand the deluge of commercials on Top40 / Classic Rock radio and live on local college radio stations;this radio is for you . all my favorite college radio stations come in crystal clear , everything from 89.1 WFDU to 91.1 WFMU and one of the long island radio(92.7 WLIR ) stations my big digital receiver ca nt even find.the buttons are a little small , but that drawback out weighs the features . like a button located on the top of the radio that illuminates the LCD screen for 7 second.the Short wave is somwhat alright , i am told that the big city with all its electronics interfears with Sw reception .
3 #### The side stitching tore at the elastic band where the seat cushion secures to the seat.it is two weeks old .
5 #### the item is a 3X barlow and is of good quality . You may here a lot that all you need is a 2X barlow and you shall not get a 3X. This statement is not quite right and totally wrong in certain cases . Besides the use of barlows for visual observations in combinations with eyepieces , barlows are an absolute must for asrtophotography especially with some newtonian reflectors r\telescopes who will not reach focus with a DSLR camera attached directly to the scope ( aka prime focus ) . Barlows fix this issue and as a matter of fact this is when you need to have a 2X and a 3X Barlow as well since using each will give you different levels of zoom on your camera and also stacking the 2 Barlows together works well for astrophotography and gives you a third option of zoom level . This Barlow works very well alone and in combination with my 2X Barlow for astrophotography on my Reflector telescope .
3 #### My stylus pens worked okay , the rubber bottom came apart on my silver one and the top clip fell out of the red one . I still have the black one left .
5 #### These are incredible for the price . Ca n't beat the lifetime warranty on these . They look and feel flimsy and are delicate to handle but they produce incredible sounds . Very good base too . I 've owned these for 10 years now and have produced an incredible sound stage for me . Unfortunately , I think I accidently bumped them in the trash not realizing I did that and now there gone forever . I 'm still searching for them around my house but I think there gone . So very upsetting . But now I 'm looking at getting the KOSS ESP950 's for my next upgrade . I hear so many great reviews on these headphones along with the electrostatic performance I 've yet to experience . But the price range is way beyond these headphones and probably not justified to many . But these PortaPro 's are a fantastic purchase and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great sound quality at this price point . There nice and light and comfortable to wear , even if you wear glasses . And you ca n't beat the lifetime warranties with no questions asked on all KOSS Headphones . I 've replaced my Pro/4AA 's 3 times since the purchase of them in 1960 with a no questions asked replacement . For some reasons on those headphones , either the left or right side of the ear cans seem to stop working after 15 years of use . Anyway 's , these ProtaPro will be a great choice for anyone looking for a great sound that 's portable .
5 #### I use this product as a power supply for my Danelectro CoolCat Transparent Overdrive . It is great because it reduce any noise from network ... And the most important : it have a small price !
4 #### Got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center . In essence , they work . They are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords , holding them in one , neat bundle . They are n't really meant for identifying cables , but for holding several in a bundle . Because they work great , I ca n't give them less than 4 stars . $ 3 and change is pretty cheap , but if you wanted , you could do the same job with much cheaper products , which is why I did n't give it 5 stars . Summary : Works great . Cheap , but cheaper options available .
3 #### this item met all my expectations . I am very pleased with my purchase It has fulfilled the need and reason for purchase .
5 #### This has been my favorite mouse since they started making them . No wrist motion needed .
1 #### The cord is not up to standards does nt charge the tablet efficiently whatsoever . DO NOT BUY .
4 #### We were attempting to replace the same styled knife that was misplaced from the Ginsu block set . This Ginsu Kotta Open Stock Series 5 - Inch knife is shorter than the original contained with the set but I find it much easier to handle and enjoy working with it . However it just bit me this morning ! The fault lies with me , I was multitasking while holding the knife and a potato peeler and trying to put away some other items - OUCH . This is the second time that I have cut myself with one of the knives in he Ginsu collection , the first time occurred many years ago and I sustained permanent nerve damage to my left middle finger while trying to hurriedly make breakfast before school . And then today , the index finger of my right hand was slashed . It bled like crazy but I do n't think the cut is as deep as the first . Be careful with these very sharp knives . We are believing that the Ginsu Kotta Open Stock Series Japanese 420J2 Stainless Steel 7 - Inch Santoku Blade with Stainless Steel Handle 4857 is the probable replacement for the original .
1 #### This I can not recommend . Although the price and shipping fees were reasonable and the item arrived on time , it does NOT work . I own one already and I know how to use it properly . I have attempted to use it to charge multiple batteries and it will NOT charge them at all . The unit is supposed to charge a battery until fully charged , then turn off automatically . It does not do this . When plugging a battery into it , it lights up indicating that it is charging . However , after charging 2 different batteries for over 12 hours each , it neither charged the batteries nor turned off as it is supposed to do . I have no problem exchanging the item if the seller contacts me as I do need a second charger , but I definitely need it sent back . I need instructions from the seller on how to proceed . Until the item is returned and credit paid back or the item is exchanged . I can NOT recommend the item or seller positively .
3 #### It 's my fault for not reading the description more carefully ; but hopefully someone can learn from my error . This headset was not compatible with my HTC Evo 3D.
5 #### Would recommend lubricating the rod but besides that works great .
4 #### If your requirement for a CB is compact , yet still good quality this is it . This is quite possibly one of the only " compact " CBs still made with a METAL case , not plastic . Nice clear , LOUD receive audio . My only complaint is the microphone is way too small , almost a joke . This is easily fixable by getting a bigger one from Uniden however .
5 #### A great resonant head for toms ! Sustains great without being harsh and trashy sounding on the high end .
5 #### I 'm a hobbyist , and I 'm currently using this lens with my 40D ( 1.6x crop sensor ) . This is my first 1:1 macro lens and I 've been having a ton of fun with it ... getting insanely close details on ordinary things makes for extraordinary photos ( it 's hard to take a ' bad ' photo with this lens , but it takes quite a bit of photographic knowledge to take ' great ' photo with it ) . I 've been using it to photograph nature , toys , food ( some beautifully unflattering pictures ) , the moon ( although small in the frame , the details are there ) , and portraits ( I love the portraits it takes ... not too flattering , but honest in a kind of brutal way ) . This lens is razor - sharp in the details so even for taking non - macro pictures , you 'll get great results . You 'll need a flash to get the most out of this lens when shooting macro . I ran out and bought a flash after getting this lens ( and gave myself another thing that 'll take me months to learn the basics of ) . I 'm still discovering how best to use all of my gear together , but it 's a fun process . Highly recommended .
5 #### A very nicely made , small - size gnome .... almost too nice to use in the little contest we have going with our neighbors where we surprise each other from time to time with a well - hidden garden decoration . This guy is a cut above most garden gnomes ...
5 #### The most popular acoustic guitar string . My customers are the ones who love them . Try them out too . I guarantee .
4 #### This is a great cable if you are cramped on space and need to move your printer to a distant location . works for me !
5 #### I got these for my new - to - me 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche . They great and do not move once placed . I also bought the rear set . They seem to keep all the dirt in place and are easy to shake out . Definitely recommend .
5 #### I have a Wrangle - X but it 's got the Rubicon wheel package so the tires are 255/75 - 17 ( I do n't know what all the numbers mean so I just post them all ) . I bought the 2X size and it fits good , coming over the back side by about 2 " , feeling snug and secure . I do n't really see the " denim " look but at least it does n't have the shiny look . Material feels durable , should last pretty good .
5 #### Purchased the 8x21 binoculars for my daughter for a concert which was nearly sold out except for upper balcony seats . The view and distance in these little folding binoculars are amazing and they fold up to fit inside your purse . Would highly recommend .
5 #### What can I say , other than it fits snug , stays closed and it readable through the plastic cover . Good product .
5 #### Love it and I have three other ones that I use daily
1 #### This isn.t my first boat ride but its the last time il buy junk from this company . this thing broke just screwing it in . Should throw me another one and if it does n't suck il change my feedback
5 #### Gave this to a friend who just bought a new D-41 , I put a Grissman Dawn mando pic and a DAVA , ready to go
1 #### Flimsy crap , the way it folds up is terrible , the thin metal sections actually get tangled up within each other . Needs about a half foot of desk behind it to stand .
4 #### But not for this price and utility . Conditions for hearing music are never perfect so must you have super expensive perfect strings ? Robust and not prone to breaking during a performance ...... in fact have n't broken a string in years . Great value for multiple packages and good value when you buy one package .
5 #### The venerable V6 is a steal at $ 70 . I also own a pair of MDR7506 's and the sound is indistinguishable between them . Hooked up to home or studio gear they sound great . And it is true you can order inexpensive replacement ear pads from Sony 's parts division . The Sennheiser HD280 is the main competitor to the V6 / MDR7506 . Connected to studio / home equipment , the HD280 may be a better choice for classical , jazz and acoustic music . The mids sound a little cleaner than the V6 . Having said that the HD280 is larger than the V6 and requires more power for equal loudness and bass . iPods and MP3 players just do n't have enough juice to power the Sennheiser ; the V6 is more efficient .
1 #### I was falling for all the reviews that this headset received and was bitterly disappointed . I sound like calling from Venus with this phone . I have a fairly deep voice and that just could be the issue . But my wife started to refuse to talk to me over this headset as the receiving end has a hard time understanding what you say . Regarding the noice assassin ... it does not work . If I walk outside talking on the phone most of the words get swallowed by wind noises , even if there is no wind . Do not buy this headset ... it is all hype .... another [ ... ] down the drain
5 #### All good or I would 've sent them back do n't have time to make out free reviews would be glad to do so for a little pocket money !
4 #### Very nice love the color option as it Maude 's life easy & you can see which wire is for what.worked for me .pretty too
5 #### Good product , good price , and free delivery . What else do you need to say .
5 #### Awesome ! I almost did n't buy this b / c I could n't tell how ' heavy ' they were and if they would be able to get the job done safely . Boy was I wrong . These are awesome ! They fit snugly on the spring and then the pins push over the spring to lock into place . Completely safe and heavy duty . The only thing I wish was different is that both ends of the all thread were ' capped ' so that a wrench could fit on either end .
3 #### they are just okay for the price . took a long time to receive
1 #### Wow . Did not fit well at all in my 90 Miata . I made it work with a lot of dremel work . Plan on buying a dremel if you do n't have one . A lot of modification is required .
4 #### This pick has decent grip and is almost equivalent to a heavy pick ( thickness ) . It 's a little bit more flexible than a heavy pick , but you can really get to attack the strings with it .
5 #### Good looking cable which appears to be well put together . Much nicer than traditional black rubber coated cable .
3 #### The light works OK but it is much dimmer than other reading lights that I 've had in the past . Not particularly impressed with the light .
5 #### I used the Shure SM-58 for over 40 years so it was hard to let go . But I like this microphone and the sound I getting singing through it . I do n't think it will ever be able to hammer nails like the forever sturdy SM-58 , but I 'll treat it real sweet because it sounds SO GOOD ! !
4 #### The initial results were excellent , but I must admit I was a little surprised to see how long the lens becomes when at maximum focal length . The weight also intimidated me at first , but when mounted on a Canon Digital Rebel XTi with a battery grip attached , it seems to balance out decently . I do have to say that , in accordance with other reviews , low light is not a friend of this lens . I have n't done much outdoor photography ( due to time contraints , time of the year , etc . ) , but what I 've done has turned out very clear and pleasing . I have a feeling that well - lit outdoor shots is where this lens might excel best . This is definitely a massive upgrade over the kit lens ( in focal length , size , weight , and quality ) , so be prepared for all four . I 'm not sure if the price justified the purchase , but I think that if good care is taken of this lens , then over time it will surely pay itself off . Do I recommend ? Only if you find the Digital Rebel kit lens too limiting , and want that extra focal length , if you do n't mind the extra size , if you have a need for the extra zoom , and are ready for upgrading . Otherwise , practice on the kit lens or a cheaper lens for a while before moving up .
5 #### This is actually the second time I 've replaced the eyecup on my XTi after it has gotten knocked off or damaged . Perfect replacement at a fair price .
5 #### Great piece of hardware have n't gotten to use all the features yet but from what I have used so far I am impressed . Delivery was prompt and in good condition . Reccommend this product to all .
5 #### Easy and less messy way to grease bearings . Heavy duty design , big thick plastic and everything you need except grease and bearings . I wish they 'd print the directions on the side of the item or provide a sticker to put on with the directions . Not that its terribly hard to use , but I use it infrequently enough that I may forget to put the tapered side down . The cost will be saved in paper towels not used cleaning up messy hands .
4 #### Well made case looks great one weak point that did break where the charging port is did not change the functionality of the protection hardly noticeable but is worth noting does get dirty easy
5 #### Good to have on hand if needed to make A FAST COPY
5 #### using this for 8 ip cameras , and it work very well
5 #### These are LOUD . Loudest Horn of this Type I have come across . I bought two and am pleased with what I received . These are perfect for an ATV or Motorcycle . I may just fit one to my Car . Recommended/
4 #### I used it to remove the coil springs from my 1981 camaro . It did the job well but I did have to use some spacers as others have said.others used washers , but I used two 3/4 nuts . I had no problems with slipping as others have mentioned . I wonder if they just did not put the upper and lower " hooks " opposite each other and created two unequal pressure points .
2 #### These reeds are great .... If you do n't plan on using them . They produce a thin sound with zero support creating wasted air . Hemkes are cut very poorly and and not uniform at all . You 'd be lucky to get 1 playable reed out of a box . If you are just starting out , spend the extra dough on some Vandorens or some Rico Reserves or Royals . The point is when it comes to reeds , the last thing you want to do is cheap out . After all , the reed is what makes the sound , the saxophone itself is just one big amplifier .
5 #### I like these binoculars and they are well made , but I think they are too strong . I bought them to go to shows at our local theater but they are so high powered I think i would get a lower power next time . Would be great for long distance .
5 #### They are strings , they make noise , and they last a long time . Been using Polywebs for years and have n't looked back !
1 #### Same issue as previous review . Matte finish starts flaking in a few days . Incipio has changed return policies in my opinion to discourage returns of defective products . Buyer beware . Good product if you want to use if for a few days .
5 #### These are a bit awkward to put on at first but I assume you get used to that . From the moment you have them on , listen to music and think you are using a $ 350 pair of headphones . The sound quality is simply outstanding and outright unbelievable that anyone could produce something like this and sell it for this price . I just got mine and simply felt compelled to get off my bum and write a review - they are that good . They do leak a bit of sound so I would refrain from using them to listen to hard rock in a funeral ( the look may also be a bit of a giveaway ) but other than that - they are simply unbelievable . Highly recommended . As far as the comparison to the PX100 - my wife has those ( these were a replacement for my pair that I gave someone as a present ) and the sound quality of the Koss is far better .
5 #### This works really good . I use it to shape Kydex .
5 #### Needed more memory for Garmin GPS . It arrived on time as planned for vacation . Plugged in side of Garmin and updated . Worked great .
5 #### I sing and Play Bass at church and this Microphone works great very comfortable and sounds Great
5 #### Works - prompt delivery - not issues - OEM brother cart - works just fine in my label maker - not sure with what s up with Amazon 's posting filters - their trying to tell me my original review could n't be posted ? - its a great product ! - like what gives ?
5 #### This power source socket works well and is handy on my pontoon console
5 #### Have been using these for years and will continue to do so ! suuuuuuuuper slinky ! ! ! !
3 #### They sound decent , with adequate bass and overall good sound . They do n't cup my ears properly or tightly enough , but sound ok despite that . Definitely worth the money , or up to $ 20 .
5 #### It 's a K&N product sold my K&N to clean K&N filters . Not much else to say about the product . It works well and the spray can makes it way easier to evenly apply the air filter oil .
5 #### this product is perfect . fitted my phone perfectly and protected it too . phone fell from my hand recently and i believe if it was n't for this case , phone would have suffered some damage .
2 #### This is by far the most extreme loudest earpeice I have ever put to my ear . It will hurt your ears at high level . The bad side to this thing is that if you turn it off for any reason it may and may not turn back on . You actually have to plug it in to the charger to get it working again even though the battery is not dead . I have ordered 2 of them and sent both back . Now I have the plantronics M50 and it works great but does nt get as loud as the H17 which is a downside to it but i am still satisfied with my plantronics because i have never had one as comftable in my ear and it does nt try falling out or even getting loose
3 #### I figured Fulton was a pretty solid name in trailer supplies , so I ordered two of these kits . Unfortunately , they are being installed on a boat trailer and the seals provided are not double lipped seals . Also , one of the seals tore during installation , I 've never seen that happen , ever . I ended up buying two Tru - Ryde double lipped seals from another supplier . Much better quality and they have a " garter spring " that keeps the seals tight against the axle . Downside is , I 'll have to remove / disassemble both hubs to put in the good seals .
5 #### This was a quality product , at appeared to be made very well and would have made life easier with moving the speaker around where it was needed ; however it was not compatible with my laptop . That may have been a problem with the laptop itself as it has been sent back for repair shortly after . I might could have gotten it to work if I had kept at it . The company was very easy to work with to return the speaker and get a refund .
4 #### I am concerned by some reports that oil could come loose and infiltrate the mass air sensor . There are millions of these around so if there was a major problem it would have come to light by now .
5 #### I purchases this 3 - pack ( 3 for screen & 3 for backing ) protector film for my 4s from Verizon . Films fit well with no problem . I have no prior experience with less expensive films to compare on this phone . They are as clear as films can get . All holes align as they should . Video is available on youtube if motion - picture instructions are needed . -update 03/22/2013- Still have the same screen protector . It 's as visible as it could get . All corners are undamaged ( granted I have a silicone case around it ) . I 've dropped this a few times ; screen is still great . Protector doing its job .
5 #### Wish I new about the aftermarket batteries before getting this one . They 're about the same quality wise , and half the price .
5 #### I put these on my acoustic and they are great quality . They stay in tune very well also .
5 #### I use this in my HP chromebook 14 . So far it works great , I also put ubuntu on it as well and everything runs quickly .
5 #### This is a very good little fuse holder and will work for most applications , but the wiring is too small to use on a solar system .
5 #### Good product , I protect the smartphone of several blows and it attaches great . recommended
5 #### Not the highest bino 's you can buy , but they are a very good value for what we needed . Were exactly as advertised , in excellent condition and the recipient of this Christmas gift was more than happy to have it .
5 #### smaller than I thought but a great item for someone , especially for games
5 #### A great add for any USB device . It works efficiently .
5 #### Purchased it for my brother . He recommended a 5 - star rating
5 #### This is a good quality set off strings and should l last you for a long time depending on if you p play 5 hours a day than There not but average users should get long life out o of them
5 #### Well , this does exactly what it says . It slips onto my mic stand , and holds some guitar picks . Very convenient and very useful . I am very happy to have this .
5 #### This classic is hard to beat . It 's built like brick and works forever .
3 #### While they do have a loop at the end , to thread through the cable and remain attached to it , the loop itself is very narrow . I could only use these with that ability on my Apple Lightning cable -- which is narrow enough to feed through the loop . None of my mini or micro USB cables would fit . As I was hoping to use these to organize a wide range of cables , they are just not as useful as the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Belkin - Velcro - Cable - Ties-8 - Inch / dp / B00000J1SC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Belkin Velcro Cable Ties ( 8 Inch)</a > , which have a larger loop and work great .
4 #### The lock arrived early and did what it is suppose to do . It is easy to install and comes with a velcro strip to wrap up the cord when not in use . Good overall product .
4 #### First of all I liked the fact that it came coiled in a circular coil instead of the bow tie pattern that leaves bends through out the lenght of the cord . The jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief . It sounds ok for the price .
4 #### Decent quality fitting , not yellow jacket quality but cost much less as well .
5 #### this pop filter works great .it was just what i wanted.thank you.i would buy this pop filter again
5 #### I bought this for my dad since his battery was shot . He was stunned to see his phone still had a full charge after a 4 minute call ! lol
4 #### I 'm looking for an upgrade from my older GE that is very close to this one . What is the difference between the RCA RP7887 AM / FM Super Portable Radio and the RCA 7 - 2887 Superadio III Portable AM / FM Radio ? From what I can see there is no diference but maybe someone can let me know . The unit I bought had the AM and FM numbers for turning were way off . Like the 680AM station was around the 800AM or the 910AM station was between 1000AM and 1200AM . That should have been corrected while it was being made .
1 #### this was a waste of money due to the fact that it says that it is a cell phone neck lanyard , however it did not work , another waste of my money
5 #### I got this product through one of those " free stuff website " , anyways this product works great with my GSM Galaxy Nexus . I am now able to connect USB flash drives , DSLR cameras , USB mouse , and USB keyboards to my phone and be able to use them ! It 's great . I do a lot of photography sometimes low angle , and I hate getting down on the floor . So now , I just hook up my camera to my phone and control using my phone . The shipping was a bit long though , but it 's getting shipped from China .
5 #### Great price and it does what a hub should do . I have had multiple versions of this switch and all work well with my home networking needs for Netflix and Slingbox . I recommend it .
5 #### I researched BT 's for over a month . They all have 1 to 5 stars as far as reviews , none seem perfect , but I liked what I saw in this headset . Points : Next gen BT 2.0 compatability , the sequel to the popular 510 , with multipoint technology , a sleeker design , and easy to use . Took me about an hour to figure out , very simple to use . That button you see in the picture is the multifunction button works for answering ( click ) , pairing ( holding down ) volume ( click up and down like a light switch . ) Paired within a minute . Took 2 hours to completely charge . The ear loop is partially made of rubber very comfortable . CNET reviewer liked it alot , only downside was it was bland . I do n't think so I think it looks cool and hip . It 's base is the size of a small swiss army knife you 've seen those not obtrusive at all . Like that jawbone looks pretty in the picture but is obnoxiously huge and plastic and btw got a 41 out of 100 on consumer reports . Only downside I could see is if it 's not properly stored it could get damaged , it 's very light weight . It comes with a charger and tiny holding stand , but no other replacement ear clips , but the clip itself seems well made . I got it from PC Universe for $ 52 which includes tax shipping , received in 3 days .
4 #### Good Product but , nothing the regular cable that comes in the box will do . The best part would be is I used my phone as an alarm clock or watched movies on my phone .
4 #### Great stuff . I 've always recommended this product to family and friends . You can actually see this stuff go to work and tell by the outcome . Do n't hesitate , just grab a can and use it . You 'll want to get more for future use as well .
5 #### It does what it says . It a Kyser Quick Change capo . This capo is great for changing keys in the middle of a song or anytime you are in a hurry . Highly recommended .
1 #### I compared a Monster Cable vs one the one from Phillips which costs less than half this . And guess what , no difference . That 's right . They rip you off . And what 's the purpose off a gold plated connection if the rest of the signal passes through a copper cable . It irks me see the staff at BestBuy and Circuit City pitching Monster 's $ 75 Component Cables and $ 120 HDMI cables at uneducated customers . There are cheaper and equally performing cables out there . Do your research and save some of your hard earned money . By the way , be wary of all the glowing reviews you read on amazon for this product or for others as well . Recently I have been seeing a lot of positive reviews from anonymous reviewers or reviewers with only one review to their name .
5 #### Put my Schecter C-1 Custom FR in Drop Bb , these strings sound great and have a great low end . Highly reccomend .
5 #### If you are migrating to the new series of Garmin GPS units from the old series ( like me moving from 60 to 62 series ) , you may not be immediately at home with the carabiner clip that comes with the new series . This is just like the familiar old clip . It stays in place and is easy to snap on and off a bely or backpack strap .
5 #### What can be said about the humble ethernet cable ? It helps spread high - speed internet to all our favorite gadgets - TVs , game consoles , and computers . This one does the job , at a decent price .
3 #### The description says the color is gold . It 's not . More of a greenish yellow , but does what it is intended for . I think I would stick with the black color though .
3 #### Nice quality product but is way , way , way smaller than it appears in the ad . Got one close to this but at least twice the size and half the price . Good product but not worth the price , shop around .
5 #### I got the red band -- > 10 to 35 Pounds ( 1/2 " * 4.5 mm ) . It arrived in a plastic packaging , and was secured with two little red bands . It is the perfect width overall . and you can step on it and do goo stretches . I found that double twisting the band makes it better on short stretches .
5 #### I use a Pentax and camera snaps in place just like using a lens . Adds a whole new avenue to star viewing or can be used as a giant telephoto lens .
5 #### This is the best case I 've found so far for my Panasonic Lumix LX-5 . It hold the camera snugly but not too tightly , there is room left over for memory cards and a spare battery . I think it is a little too large to hang off your belt ( though it does have a belt loop ) , but you can use the shoulder strap just fine . I would highly recommend this case for any camera the size of an LX-5 .
4 #### I have used these on other vehicles with no problems . Like the fact you can go a lot of miles before cleaning . The cleaning process is a little hassle , but I just like the fact that you do n't have to throw them away like the paper filters . Do they improve mileage and or Power . That remains a question mark for me . If they do it is not by a lot as far As I can tell . Not really the reason I buy K&N.
5 #### This thing keeps me completely dry in the Florida rainstorms . I just wish that A - I could get smaller pants as I 'm only 5'4 and B - The pants totally unzipped to make it easier to put on with boots . It does get you warm , but I was surprised at how cool it keeps you while riding . That was a nice plus . I highly recommend and the material is really nice and you will be seen at night in this .
3 #### GOOD THING ABOUT IT ...... THE MATERIAL THAT THEY USED IS PRETTY DESCENT MAPLE NECK ( SEMI - FAST NECK SHAPE ) VERY EASY TO PLAY ... QUILTED MAPLE BODY ( WOW ) 2 VOLUME 1 TONE CONTROL KNOBS 3 - WAY SWITCH ... SOUND IS OKAY I DONT MIND PLAYING THE GUITAR LIVE ON PUBLIC ... OVER ALL LOOKS AND PLAYABILITY IS PRETTY DESCENT ... BAD THING ABOUT IT ...... ALIGNMENT ( PICK - UP HOLE ) THE STRINGS ARE NOT VERY CENTERED ON THAT SIX METAL HEAD OF THAT HUMBUCKER PICKUPS I WOULDN'T TRUST THE TREM ... IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY DONE IT THROUGH BODY TYPE OR JUST USED FLOYD ROSE TREM ... IT HAS A ROUGH NECK END CUT > > > LOOKS LIKE THAT JUST BEEN CUT , JUST BY THE SKILL SAW NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE SANDED OR CLEAR NATURAL PAINTED ( JUST THE END PART ) WERE YOU CONNECT THE NECK AND THE BODY ... I HATED THAT SO MUCH IT KILLS THE WHOLE INTERMEDIATE THING TYPE .. THAT WHAT MAKES IT A BEGINNER TYPE GUITAR ... SO AS THE PAINT JOB THE SEE THROUGH BLUE FINNISH OVER LAPPING THE IVORIOD EDGEST AND THAT MAKES THE GUITAR LOOKS CHEAP AND CHINA MADE ... AND THE WORSE ABOUT IT IS THE RE - SELLING VALUE ... BAD BAD BAD ...
5 #### I replaced an old Ramsey Patriot Profile 8000 with this winch . I put it through its paces last week at the Vermont Overland Trophy and it performed very well . Synthetic line is the way to go if the winch is going to see normal use !
2 #### Very sturdy picks but also very hard to hold on to as the surface of these picks have no grip at all .
4 #### cleans up my lawnmower engine . now i can mow until the cows come home !
4 #### Works well at my office , I have no issues with this device . Before I had issues with the standard head set , people said they had a hard time hearing me , if my mouth was not right next to phone microphone .
1 #### Tried to save a buck ... you get what you pay for . The clamp actually popped itself off as soon as I mounted it .
5 #### I 'm glad I chose to go with the hybrid . I been using extra light all my life and with the eve copy guitar I have the hybrids brought a new tone a little more sustain and crunch more crisp and feels great to my hands . Thanks for your business
5 #### Great at removing brake dust , the best of three or four I 've tried . Obviously , any reasonably dirty wheel will require some manual effort as well , so be prepared to buy a decent brush if you go too long between wheel cleanings . Only problem is , it 's bloody expensive . The per - bottle price does n't seem all that bad til I checked some of the other wheel cleaners I had around and realized those other bottles are twice the size of the 3 M one . o_0 Final note , I 've only used this on typical painted / clearcoated factory and aftermarket wheels . Have * not * tried this on chrome or anything else .
5 #### Connected between tablet and HDTV . Sturdy wire , Great picture , Great sound , Great price .
5 #### Works exactly as expected . My intake is filter is clean again !
5 #### Outstanding quality for the price . Fits my Les Paul perfectly . Do n't hesitate to buy this if you just need a case for moving your guitar around lightly . Has a light amount of padding but enough to give me comfort it 's protecting the guitar .
5 #### Got this for oil changes on my Victory Vision . It works well but you do have to poor slow as to not overflow the funnel . It is a good length and offered an easy tool for use with my motorcycle .
2 #### First of all , I 'm really really jealous of those of you who said their signal jump from 1 or 2 bars to 5 bars . I live in a condo so I have to mount the antenna on the inside where I got around 3 bars in that area . Even with the green steady lights on the booster with gain set at the max . The signal only jumps may be a bar up and down depending on my movement . I really want it to work , but at this price . I think it 's going back . Once my contract is up I 'm switching from AT&T to Verizon . There 's more Verizon towers than AT&T in my area anyway according to the towers locator app . Got 5 bars on my old Verizon flip phone when I fire it up to test it .
5 #### This is great stuff for external black plastic or vinyl automobile bumpers and trim .... makes them look practically new .
1 #### The case was great until the faceplate came off and would no longer stay on the phone . This happened to mine , my girlfriends , and a couple of friends of ours when we all got the same phones and accessories . Do not buy this . Mine lasted three weeks and that was the longest any of us got out of this product .
1 #### Do not use on motorcycles , it eventually breaks the rubber valve , bad experience .... ( Fatigue )
5 #### I wish I could only have bought one of these , but they were only sold in pairs so now I have a backup . The hubs are easy to put on , except they take 2 special axle nuts per axle . Each round nut has 4 slots and needs a special tool to tighten ( torque ) . I had zero luck trying to find rebuild kits for this hub . If they exist they might have been cheaper . The last hub I had got ruined from loose axle nuts .
3 #### My Taylor guitar came with these on it so I ordered this set to replace them . I play every weekend and ca nt afford in my act to break strings often . I broke 2 in one set and said I am going back to DR brand strings . They sound real good but so do the DR acoustic strings DRs hardly break and I have to change them less to . Maybe I got a bad set of Elixirs or something because others really like them .
4 #### Well , what else is there to say about something that just holds on to your guitar until you are ready to use it ? The construction is fairly solid and does its job well . I would n't recommend trying to hang a cello from it . ( Not that you would , but ... )
5 #### A Great deal . Gave to my son for his vehicle
5 #### I tried this for the first time at work . Inmediatly bought one . They are lightweight , excelent of running , great bass .
4 #### IF you open the package and read the enclosed directions you can have these properly installed in 15 minutes . They give the vehicle a " polished " look . When you have as much rain and 90 to 100 degree days as where I live these really are a must have . They allow you to vent the vehicle and my guess would be that with these installed and the windows vented well that the interior temperature will be at least 30 + degrees cooler . Per the directions the windows are to be left up for 24 hours so the adhesive on the tape sets well so allow time for this . They look great and perform great . The ones I received had come loose inside the vacuum pack and got a little scratched up but they do n't show up too much so it is no big deal to me but that is why I only gave them a 4 Star .
5 #### This is just a USB to micro - USB cable , good for chargers or data connections -- 1 M is a handy size to carry with you when you travel , but might be a little short for desktop use . The cable is well made , intended for a blackberry , but works great with a droid .
5 #### The Club works very well to deter amateur would - be car thieves . It 's easy to use : just place it over the steering wheel and pull . It locks automatically when it 's at the right length for your steering wheel . I like the red colored Club because it makes the Club stand out ; and when it 's easy to see thieves may well think twice before trying to steal your car . The keys work well for years ; and although some reviewers say their Clubs did n't last so long , mine is over two years old and going strong . The downside to the Club is , at least I 'm told , that a professional car thief can cut through it somehow pretty quickly and steal my car anyway . However , I would still recommend this device as a deterrent to car theft ; it ca n't hurt and together with a car alarm system your vehicle should be as protected as it ever could be ! Overall , the Club is well worth every penny you spend for it . Mine still works great after years and the red color make the club stand out . The Club is particularly effective when used in conjunction with a car alarm system .
4 #### ONLY 4 STARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER WORKS FINE JUST A LITTLE LIGHT .
5 #### I would have given it four stars because the rubber in the sockets keeps coming out but the degrees of movement offered by this socket has helped me in a lot of tight places !
3 #### First ever review on these and I have owned them for over 9 years . Still going strong , but there have been several issues over the years . The first issue had to do with the earpads .... they only lasted about three years and had to be replaced . Not an expensive replacement , but worth noting . Then , sometime within the last 5 years , I started getting intermittent sound and had to replace the wire connecting both sides together . This was n't a horrendous job , but still had to be done right ( I used some cheap two wire speaker cable I had lying around ) . The current problem seems to be that the left headphone speaker and pad have pulled away from the main part of the headphone . I think the screw holes warped or broke and the assembly gave way . Something else I 'll have to repair soon , but for now these units are still working as long as I 'm not careful to tug too much on that side . The biggest reason for 3 stars though is frequency response . I did n't find the frequency response close enough really to use for any serious recording work . You can equalize this out to compensate , but I thought the response would be better initially . What response is present though is ok .
1 #### Ordered because it is supposed to be 10 AWG . But it is actually 12 AWG . Dissapointed as I already had 12 AWG fuse holder .
4 #### nice product - package appeared to have been previously opened - but all was there - a few rubs on the finish but no complaints . thank u
4 #### I have the White iPhone 4 with&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/OtterBox - Universal - Defender - Case - for - iPhone-4 - Black - Silicone - Hot - Pink - Plastic / dp / B004N7D4HC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 ( Black Silicone & Hot Pink Plastic)</a>&nbsp;and bought this adapter to use with my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Panasonic - iPod - iPhone - Compact - Clock - Radio - AM - FM - Radio - Dual - Alarm - and - Clear - Vision - Sound - Black / dp / B0040GWXG4 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Panasonic iPod / iPhone Compact Clock Radio , AM / FM Radio , Dual Alarm and Clear Vision Sound ( Black)</a > . It does the job well . It fits perfectly into my phone with the case on & then into the clock radio . The sound works , the alarm works , it charges and all the features work fine . It does raise the phone up pretty high in the dock , making it seem a little unstable , but overall , I would recommend this product if you have a phone with a case that interfers with the docking of the phone .
5 #### These are very thin picks , great for strumming with no effort . I used these recently for a televised program , and they were great .
5 #### These are great picks for a mandolin . They are a bit harder than most picks and the sound quality that is produced is great . Not sure you 'd need something this stiff with a guitar but a banjo might be another good instrument for this thickness . I buy a bunch at a time because my granddaughter likes to wander off with them ( she 's good about not putting them in her mouth but she leaves a pink trail most of the time ) .
5 #### I believe this is a better alternative to the USB drive and much better than a floppy disk drive . I have one at home in my desktop and another I use at work to backup important files . I do n't have to worry about loosing it since it is big and it is very durable .
5 #### a crank that cranks ... Hard to say more ! It works .. am installing new total string set on my autoharp .. Note : DONT EVER do such a thing by removing all the strings first ! that 's WRONG and RISKY ... .. Do ONE string at a time , prevents warping the entire instrument ...
4 #### If you 're a professional photographer , you can probably ignore this review . But then you probably wo n't be thinking about buying this lens anyway , as you 'll be off to purchase a nice L series . However , if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera ( or equivalent ) and enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens will probably work out very well for you . I 've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks , and it has performed very much as expected . For the price , it 's perfect for a go - everywhere lens . A few main points . Okay , it 's not the best image quality . Even on low / medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses . It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit , but for well - lit outdoor shoots it 's works very well . Of course , it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS , but if you ca n't afford that then this is a very good value lens . Not for the real professionals , but great if you do n't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and , let 's face it , who does n't want a but more zoom !
4 #### What you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone . I 'm not saying the tone is bad , but it 's not as good as quality strings with no coat . That having been said , I 'm pleased with them as a string for guitar practice . They last for months without a change in tone . I don;t play much in public venues , so it is not a problem for me to change strings when I do .
5 #### I have owned over a dozen different models of bluetooh headsets . This is the best sounding and most comfortable of all of them so far . The range is good , battery life is good I only wish they came with more ear inserts as spares .
5 #### I bought this charger before going on a trip . It was able to charge my phone on low battery and two friends phones on one charge . I had to send them both one when we returned home because they said they could n't live without it . I highly recommend this charger !
5 #### I bought this to combine PS3 audio with the DAC from my computer so I could play the PS3 at my computer desk and be able to use two headphones ( on separate amps ) for both sources . I do n't detect any loss of fidelity unless I turn the knobs past the notch at 12 o'clock , but that is so loud that it does n't really matter . Very solid build and it does exactly as intended . UPDATE : I 've integrated my PS4 . Everything is still great really love this thing .
5 #### Fits better than other manufacturers ' deflector det because it tucks behind mirror . BEFORE U install ! ! ! CLEAN the rubber and use adhesive promoter ! ! ! ! !
1 #### It worked pretty good for the first few days but then it broke at the top part where it snaps in . If you can just find another one and pay an extra few bucks for it .
5 #### I ordered this battery to replace the one in my Black and Decker cordless weed trimmer - and by the way , the original battery lasted 12 years and I have used the trimmer once or twice a week in growing season the whole time . I got an " item shipped " email within an hour of placing the order and received the battery the next day , using the free shipping . I let my trimmer charge and have used it twice with the new battery and I am able to trim around my entire yard and edge my sidewalks with no sign of the battery running out . So far I am very pleased .
5 #### Very nice product worked as intended good price love it , that is all that I have to say about this product !
5 #### Works great to convert 1/2 ' ACME to 1/4 " flare . 1/4 " flare is what gage sets use .
5 #### I put this in my Samsung Galaxy S5 , it 's the largest that will work with it , GREAT ! it also works with my ASUS Tablet ... LOVE IT ! ! Now my " OLD " Laptop that was another problem , ( NOT THE CARD , The Computer ) ... It only accepts 32 gb memory cards ... Had to use the son 's ( he has the newest laptop ) , to get it up and running with the data transferred PRIOR to installation in the phone .. Buy the card at this price , Best Buy , WalMart , etc could n't get near the price ...
5 #### great phone , nice cam , 2 gb included , tv output , many functions , many software , many games the cam is kinda slow but takes amazing pics , videos are great also 3d games are great , this cell has an 3d chip , even quake has opengl acceleration , but there are few games that use this the bad , is slow on many thing , menus , contacts , etc , even with 128 mb of ram that sucks , now if you update it maybe that is fixed , i have n't update it yet
5 #### Pretty sweet piece of kit . Suspends from the ceiling well , the rectracting assembly works well . Some people may complain that it is only 16 gauge , but it works well for quick jobs in a workshop .
5 #### Great addition for any musician who uses plectrums . Pick this one !
5 #### I purchased this cable so that my daughter and her roomates can share one printer by use of a usb cable . The cable arrived on time , and appears to be well manufactured , although the test of time can only tell . I 've had expensive cables last little or not time , and cheap cables last forever . At less than $ 5 , this cable was a no brainer , as I could by many of these , as opposed to an expensive cable . At this point , they have been using the cable for over a month , and have had no problems , which I would hope will continue . However , if a cable is not treated properly , I do n't find the cost of the cable to be of any consequence , as even expensive cables can be destroyed , just as easy as a cheap one . I will update this at a later date , or if the cable ceases to work , to verify the longevity of the cable . Again , this cable is being used by several college students , who switch the cable between several computers for use of a single printer .
5 #### this is exactly what I needed for my back pack , the material is perfect and strong . It may outlast the phone
2 #### This battery I thought would work longer then it did . But it ended I had to charge it all the time . Every time I wanted to take a picture it was dead very disappointed with it . Still looking for a replacement battery for my camera .
5 #### I was attempting to change the belt and pulley tensioner for a 2007 Honda Element . I purchased this tool based on the specs . The crows foot adapter fit and I was easily able to hold the tension as imagined . However , there was one thing that was not obvious , the upper engine mount on the side of the belt would be in the way . So although it was capable , of the intended purpose , it was not useful in my application without the removal of the engine mount . This step was not in my shop manual , so I did n't do it , and thus could n't use the tool ... I ended up watching youtube and finding a video of someone using a pair of wrenches together , to basically create this tool with the needed angle to not have to remove the upper engine mount . So it did great for what it was , but I ended up not using it . I 'll keep it because it is still useful ... hopefully for another car or application .
5 #### I have tried MANY brands of guitar strings in the last 20 years , and so far GHS Electric Guitar Strings are the one I continue to use . The strings hold up well and are not likely to rust or break and can stay in tune , even after several years of storage . Although tempted to try other brands , I figure if the GHS Boomers work for me , last a long time and Sound Great , then why bother switching to another brand ?
4 #### This unit seems well made . Working well on DC power cord . We did test it on battery power , which worked okay as well . The short rubberized antenna has very short range . We removed it and went with a magnetic mount roof antenna and is very comparable to a bigger CB radio .
3 #### should have gotten the g2 heads these ring a bit too much
1 #### Not a fan of these strings . I have tried and tried in the past to like Ernie Balls , but they have done nothing but disappoint . I 'll just stick to the more expensive Elixirs .
1 #### They dealer sent me a box with one piece of bubble wrap ! ? ! ? Do not order from them ! ! ! ! ! How do they not know they are sending out an empty box ? You can feel it when you are holding an empty box !
5 #### This hardshell case is a perfect fit for the Baby Taylor . I 've read the reviews complaining about the hinges and about the case not closing properly . The hinges are fine with me and when it closes , it seals nicely . Absolutely no complaints .
5 #### great stands just wish they were taller i need to find the 12ton versions to get more height
5 #### Good product for those who know how to use it . Not for those who struggle trying to use self - serve gas station set - ups .
2 #### I bought this for my son for his Ipod 4 G and it does NOT work on an Ipod 4G. It DOES work fine on my Ipod 3rd Generation though .
4 #### I originally bought this cable to transfer files between a LG shine and a computer because my mother 's LG Shine phone screen had broken and she unfortunately did n't save any of her photos on a micro SD card . Unfortunately i could n't get the computer to recognize the phone so i was out of luck ... it did n't work for what i intended to use it for ... but it does work ... so only 4 stars because it works , just not the way i want it to and it arrived 2 days after the delivery date
5 #### Great organizer bag for your SUV / Mini Van / Car . The velcro at the bottom of the bag really keeps it in place and prevents it from sliding around . The zipper closure also keeps the contents private . I highly recommend this bag .
5 #### I 've been playing the guitar for over 20 years I 've used all type of cables and the ones from Planet Waves gives you what they promise " very good value for money " unlike cheap cables this one gives you a clear tone without or very little static noise . I play my Epiphone Explorer GT through a Fender Mustang III I only get the static noise when using a lot of overdrive and distortion . Seems to be built with good quality only will tell if it can last .
4 #### Used for a history class that my grand daughter was taken . The pins used to hold in ton the wall left little holes .
5 #### Save yourself the headache and buy this ! I fought a crank pully on an 04 crv for an hour with no success . Bought this to hold the pully and had the bolt out in 15 seconds !
5 #### Great price . I went to Wally World . One battery was $ 6.00 . Ridiculous .
5 #### I love this headset . I had a Jawbone - which I recently lost - and I had liked that headset better than any I had tried . I have tried alot of headsets . The Jawbone is very expensive , uncomfortable , and hard to put on my ear . When I read all of the positive reviews on this headset and saw that I could get it relatively cheaply , I thought I 'd give it a try . I have to say I like it alot better than the Jawbone . I 'm considering purchasing several of these to keep them around for when I lose this one which I 'm afraid is inevitable . It seems to keep it 's charge a very long time , I like the teeny little desktop charger which helps to keep the charging end of your cord from falling off your desktop . I especially like the sound . People I 've talked to ca n't even tell I 'm talking on a headset . And it 's nice and loud , I love it . Oh ya , it 's also darned easy to get onto my ear . I highly recommend this product .
4 #### The tapes are excellent . No trouble with them at all . I use T-160 so that I can record 2 full hours using SP .
1 #### Absolute garbage , shame on me for believing that $ 1.60 could buy a decent product . Does not work at all
5 #### Removes oxidation easily My new go to polish when working on gel coats . Used it for the first time yesterday in my detail shop on a badly oxidized boat . Great results , little to no dusting , wipes off very easy , Love It !
5 #### These are a perfect set of computer headphones . I tried the trendy over - the - ear style headphones similar to Beats by Dre , but they hurt my ears and head , so I thought I needed to go back to the old - school design . They are comfortable and serve their purpose at work when I listen to tutorial videos . I use them with a 27 - inch iMac .
1 #### This is a well made case , BUT not suitable for the iPhone 3GS . The magnet(s ) in the case interfere with the compass . Hopefully , they do not affect anything else !
5 #### Nice to use for listening to my iPhone on my stereo .
5 #### Just recently bought a new set of D'Addario and installed . I believe these work best with a pick which I do n't use . The last set I had was Martins and they have a softer feel . I like the sound the D'Addario has , but my finger tips are telling me I 'm having to press harder to get a good solid sound . I 'm going to try these Martins and compare .
5 #### A lot easier to spray than to dip or soak and try to squeeze oil out of filter .
5 #### VERY NICE QUALITY -- GREAT LENGTH -- CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MY MOTHER GARDENED AS MUCH AS SHE DID , USING STRING AND ROPE , ETC . TO TIE THINGS UP , BEFORE CABLE TIES BECAUSE AVAILABLE . HER LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH EASIER BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO IMPROVISE EVERYTHING . THESE ARE GREAT .
1 #### Wire is stripped , placed under insulation and crimped . About 30 % failures ... open connection at clip . Wire is about 4 thin strands . Only way to use them is to take ends apart , re - strip , solder , re - crimp . Do n't buy . Spend more , get better ones .
5 #### Great cable . I was worried about how cheap it was . But the quality is that of a $ 50 midi cable . It 's a little less then 1/2 " thick and the midi pins are very sturdy . I had a cheap on before and plugged it in crooked by accident and bent the pins . Should have bought this one in the first place . Works great with my M - Audio midi keyboard .
5 #### Great winch and i bought it with the 100 dollar rebate they were running so ca n't complain about the price . Bought for my 08 jeep wrangler and the install was easy . Have n't had any issues .
1 #### did not fit as stated . need to return . completely wrong size
5 #### This harness worked perfectly ! However , I was confused until I actually installed it . I installed an aftermarket dual - din touch screen into my 1996 Explorer Eddie Bauer with the JBL Luxury system from the factory ( which includes rear subwoofer , rear radio controls , and multi - CD player in the center console ) . This harness simply routes your wires to the back of the explorer where the amps are and allows you to connect to the stock speakers . Your stock cd player , controls , and factory amplifiers are all completely disconnected after this harness install .
5 #### Tested everything and all is in working order . Now I have extra accessories at a very low cost . I mainly ordered these items for the price .
4 #### Quite enjoy the sound of extra light D'&aacute;ddario Strings . Strongly suggests to those that prefer to play more softer on their guitar .
1 #### Ordered a iphone 3gs lcd screen from bedfordpower . Paid extra to get it this week b / c need my iphone for work . When it came in today , installed it and charge my phone up and nothing .... Look at the screen again and the LCD comes on but the back light does nt . I 'm very disappointed and WILL NOT be ordering anything from this seller again . I will be ordering another screen from closeout masters b / c I have ordered a glass screen from them before and was very happy how quickly it was delivered .
5 #### I use these mats to protect the stock ones on my SUV , plus they look great .
4 #### THIS IS A GOOD OIL EXTRACTOR FOR THE MONEY , IUSE IT ON MY SMALL ENGINES .
5 #### Used on my satin finished ukulele and was very pleased . Although satin does not " shine " the polish did provide an good feel to the finish . The cloth is an added bonus and love both products . Get some you instrument will love you for it !
1 #### it seems like Nokia designed this phone on another planet away from all other touch phones , and of course a dummy like me trusted Nokia and bought it . I had Nokia N95 before it , and it 's a much better phone . * the touch screen is a joke or made for kid fake laptops .. * the phone freezes sometimes ( the replacement ) * the speaker is under the phone , so if are sleepy and put it down with screen facing up , you will not the alarm or ring . * very bad speaker * I had downloaded the maps three times , so some reason when you check update the map , it deletes previous maps in less than a second . Good things : * GPS capability If you are spending $ 300 to buy it , spend 200 more and get Samsung S3
5 #### I bought this adapter from my 97 nissan sentra , I decided to upgrade the current car stereo with a Pioneer 6600BT ; This Wire Warness will make the install of a new car stereo much cleaner .
4 #### I 've searched for the right pick for many years . These work well especially for the price , so I get them in 12 packs .
3 #### cleans well , but gets jammed coming out of the dispenser . could me my techno lameness !
5 #### if you need something to hang up your cb micro up this will work
3 #### I gave this item a 3 star only because after 2 weeks the gold emblem fell out .
5 #### Seems to do a good job . I always run a can through the gas tank of my 1988 in - line six outboard each season and I have never had my carbs gum or carbon build - up in the cylinders . If you have an older boat motor and take care of your stuff , this with sta - bil and a good quality oil should keep you running for a long time .
5 #### Holding up well so far ! Purchased for grade schooler 's use at school
4 #### Good voice quality but not too comfortable in the ear . Could improve that issue . Battery life is not too hot .
5 #### very good . would buy it again . it clicks when you plug it in and the light comes on when plugged in . would buy it again . wish it was a little shorter , but who cares . it works .
5 #### This battery fits perfectly in my 1999 SeaDoo GTX Limited and spins the starter like my older battery could not . Seems to maintain its full charge with no problems . Costs double the standard battery so I 'll need 2 or 3 years of satisfactory service for it to be a good deal .
5 #### I love this capo . It works well and it 's stylish . Plus , as someone else stated , the boys do n't make off with it .
5 #### Love the skin for my phone ! ! It has helped keep my phone safe when I drop it too ! ! ! I can change my phone to a different color .
1 #### I normally do n't write bad reviews , i used it for almost a month and it just does n't charge i also had problems with connecting to computer , it would disconnect automatically when you move the wire , i bought from the seller " importer " , do n't buy this , or you will experience problems too .
2 #### Like another reviewer on the 90 - Minute 5 Pack item , I can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism . On my Nakamichi BX-300 , they frequently stop during recording or playback . It 's a tension problem , wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage ; basically , it thinks the tape is stuck . Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes . I 've had no problem with other , commercially available cassettes on this deck . My advice , if you have these tapes , is to run them a bit before you record to them . Pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape , then rewind fully . Maybe a few times . With one tape , after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side , until I performed the above . YMMV . Recorded audio sounds fine . I would add that these are recommended in the Nakamichi owner 's manual . Go figure .
4 #### Great headphones , great price , cable is garbage though . Buy two or three , and wait until all the cables break to send them in for the lifetime warranty so you save money on shipping .
4 #### Get lots of compliments on your cute license plate holder ... these are pretty well made for the price .... and look so cute ....
3 #### This paint is not as bad as the flat black and the universal black for some reason . That being said it is just average paint .
5 #### The title says it all ! These are an easy and convenient way to bring your iPod or cell phone music into your older car .
5 #### So handy to have ! I no longer have to constantly ' undress ' my iphone if I want to dock it . I listen to podcasts at work and using the DockBoss is so much more convenient ! I do wish it was compatible with the large Sony boombox we use at home when we work out , but I 'm sure that day will come . Overall , I am very happy with this product .
5 #### This notebook lock and security cable is just that , it works well and has never failed . The one thing to remember is not to lose any of the two keys provided .
4 #### Cute case . Nothing too special . Good price . As expected and quick delivery . Thanks for a good product ! ! Would recommend to anyone looking for a cute cheap case .
4 #### I 'm not an expert but they soung pretty good . Sort of have a metallic sound though
4 #### I got this as a cheap backup MP3 player . I 've been very happy with how it has functioned , especially considering the price . This identical model is being sold by other companies ( with various different coloring and logos ) for up to over twice the price -- same hardware and software . If you 're looking for a basic MP3 player with plenty of room and a good FM receiver , this is a great solution . Of course , if you 're looking to follow the herd and impress your friends with your lack of money management , Apple will happily accept your cash instead ...
3 #### The clips do NOT fit the bottom of my Ford F-150 . I will return and get the ones that are made for my truck . The idea , though is good .
4 #### Bought them to keep around the house for friends that come over to jam .
5 #### I was very pleased with my order . Shipping was fast and the quality of my item was just as nice as advertised . I will be buying again .. BEING AN ARMY FAMILY WE ONLY WANT THE BEST AND THIS PAST OUR TEST ..
1 #### Garmin or eBay ( whoever will take responsibility ) fails to disclose that the eTrex Vista HCx has a different contour on the back of the unit , making it incompatible with the alleged " universal " bike mount . BEWARE
5 #### i got my first pair in federal prison , these were the most expensive on the commissary . even with just an am / fm radio , these rocked , and they lasted me a cool 2 1/2 years . now that i m free , i have been in search of the perfect phone / buds to workout with . I have tried sennheiser cx-300 and although they were great , the j - cord aggravated me and also they crapped out within just over a year . I know these porta pros are tried and true , if it can handle working out everyday outside in prison , it can handle 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the gym .. great thing is they have been redesigned somewhat . my current PP 's are all black , and have a tangle free(mesh ? ) cord . This is the weakest link for headphones and much props to KOSS for addressing this . Not to mention lifetime warranty . Sennheiser wanted me to pay 40 bucks to repair some earbuds ... that 's 100 dollars i would have spent in total.hell not , got my porta pros off ebay for a cool 25 shipped .. not fake either
3 #### These held my wires together perfectly , but as soon as I moved and had to take them off , it was extremely hard . Not to mention that I ripped off a chunks of paint along with some of the wall due to the adhesive .
5 #### Ordered for a friend works great great company arrived on time thank you ! ! !
5 #### Probably one of the best made camera bags I 've used - it 's strong and durable and the production overall is really well done . We use this for our Cannon VIXIA HF G10 which fits the camera and the hood scoop but not enough to carry additional lenses or any other equipment such as stabalizing arms , microphone or lighting .
5 #### Perfectly fine strings for my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Danelectro - Baritone / dp / B007EYEE7U / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Danelectro Baritone</a > . They sound nice and bright and stay in tune for a long time . The only thing to be aware of is that the lowest string is a VERY snug fit into the tuning peg if you cut the string too short ( clipping away the tapered end of the string ) .
5 #### Works a stated in Product Description .. I did go and get their extension cable just so could sit in the drivers seat and work the reader with alot more ezzzz ....
5 #### got an extra just in case . Used first to repair a broken mirror . The distance distortion is severe but the view is great .
5 #### Very inexpensive and a great way to listen to your iphone or tablet music through your car 's audio system . Of course it only works if you happen have an installed cassette deck .
1 #### Do not waste you 're money .... Horrible quality ... Some areas on the plate are not even polished ... Pew !
5 #### Very Nice Decal .. Looks Great on My Accord .. Very sharp .. Well Made , especially for the price .. Would buy again from them ..
5 #### I have n't finished setting up my system yet . but was very impressed with it out of the box very good price working on the power supply for it
3 #### Solid product that I wish had a quick mute button . I know there are adapters for this , but I 've had issues with those in the past in terms of volume output . For comfort , I 'd give it a 4/5 since it felt a bit tight around my head .. ( but I do have a larger than average head ) . Will have to test this a bit longer and maybe update my review , but so far so good . EDIT : Returned it for an SM58S. This mic just was n't the right product for me .
4 #### I have no idea if it did anything , but it sure made me feel better putting it into my car . Its also substantially cheaper than what my local BMW dealer ship wanted to charge me for fuel injector cleaning ( around $ 300 ) . This just seemed like the logical solution .
4 #### So far it works . If it still does in a few years I 'll be happy and I would recoomend it .
4 #### I am very happy with this battery for the Razor phone . Definitely a must if your battery cycle life is down .
5 #### Looks good on my travel trailer spare tire . I think for the price it was well worth it . Time will tell how long it lasts but for now very happy .
5 #### Color coded with your vehicle . Simple to connect with bullet or butt connectors . Connect the wires at your desk and plug into the stereo and the vehicle , its that simple .
5 #### Fantastic product ! It has served my well for many months . Thank you !
5 #### I bought this card for my digital camera and I have had it for a while now . I have not had any problems with it , it was fairly cheap , and the speed seems to be fine . I reccomend it for anything except recording full 640x480 video at 30 FPS , because since this is n't a high speed card , when I tried to record at that quality and resolution , I only got about 15 or 20 seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow . Other than that , I like this card and reccomend it
5 #### These are well made for what you spend for them . I bought two . I have found when pulling trailers , the right hand mirror is just as or more important than the left when changing lanes and backing up . There is only minimal vibration of the mirrors during travel which I would expect when you take into consideration that they are a temporary mount and how far out they are extended . After you have them set up the first time , which I was able to do by myself , no help , you can leave all of the adjustments tightened for storage . Only release the ratchet enough to get the clip off the bottom of the door . Subsequent installations are MUCH easier . As mentioned before , I too have noticed a little rubbing on the glass . I am going to look for some Teflon tape for that . In the meantime I minimize window movement . When standing still I pull gently in on the glass and that eliminates the noise - Watch Your Fingers When Closing .
5 #### The Elixir NanowebPhosphor Bronze are the best acoustic strings I 've ever used , better than the 80/20 Bronze version IMHO . For what it 's worth , I 've been a full time pro guitarist for over 40 years .
5 #### I use this product to clean our bridles and saddles ; before cleaning treating them with Lexol Neatfoot Leather Dressing ! Does a great job ! A good price !
5 #### a bit difficult to put on looks good and keeps my hands from burning in florida summers
5 #### Good product . The floppy disks worked fine as advertised . FYI , I bought an External USB floppy drive to write these disks in the modern PCs ( mostly for reprogramming BIOS on old motherboards ) .
4 #### The product was what I expected and the price was the main reason I made the purchase . I have never gotten a bad wird yet knock on wood .
5 #### I 'm a Jawbone and Jawbone Prime owner and it seems that the Voyager Pro has better outgoing sound quality than my Jawbones . I 'm very happy with it . A quick test in the wind and with background noise was somewhat disappointing , but no more so than with the Jawbones . I 'd say that all preform about the same in those conditions , but the Pro is easier to work , as it does n't have to be touching my face or have a perfect fit in my ear to work well .
5 #### Took a while to get here , however very nice case , worth the wait , great price to . Thanks for the good produce
5 #### Simple cable that does the trick . It works fine for my purposes and seems to be constructed well . If you are a professional , you may want to go with a better quality cable , but I 'm not a professional and just needed something simple to hook the acoustic electric guitar and acoustic electric ukulele up to a small amp .
5 #### My niece really enjoys these strings and the do have an incredible tone for the price !
3 #### muy buen producto , cumple con mis expectativas y requerimientos , producto llego a tiempo y en excelentes condiciones por parte del vendedor , se los recomiendo para futuras compras
5 #### I 've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA , they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market .
5 #### The metal connectors have a quality look . They are also pretty flexible . Now that I see how nice these are I wo n't bother with anything cheaper . Get them , you 'll be happy .
5 #### Good quality , does not harm guitar . As good as the more expensive name brands .
5 #### I 'm actually leaving this review from my phone sitting in my recliner where I was previously rarely able to get signal . This kit enabled me to get signal but tied me to a couple of feet within the indoor antenna . I purchased an upgraded wall mount Wilson antenna and it has provided me with almost whole home coverage . If your signal us weak outside , an antenna upgrade can help a lot .
1 #### If you bought one of these from BuyAccessories call the one eight hundred number of Barnes & Noble to find out if yours is a refurbished or used product . Give them your SN and they can tell you . Mine did NOT come sealed in B&N plastic , No screen or back covers . I found out mine was used and I had paid $ 109 for it . Used is under $ 40 these days .
5 #### Torres is the only pick I 'll use . My fingers tend to sweat while playing . I never lose my grip on these .
4 #### They match the Xtreme White PIAA halogens I purchased . They 're white instead of the traditional yellow you 'll find at parts stores . Worth the extra cash . I hope they last a decent amount of time .
5 #### Very comfortable . They sound awesome and still allow you to hear the world around you .
5 #### I was a bit wary of using this product , but I had a sticking float needle in my car which was causing it to shut down occasionally . After using this in the gas tank for a couple of runs , the sticking seems to have stopped and the car idles better . I am replacing the needle this winter when I take the engine out , however this product seemed to hold me over for the summer and fall . Snake oil ? Works for me !
4 #### For a long time , I wanted to get the flash off the camera ; and there are only a few options : Flash cord , STE-2 , and Radio transmitters , to name a few ; the STE-2 is a great compromise . It works great indoors ; it even works outdoors ; although , not as good as indoors . It works 90 % of the time if you are in a shaded area ; about 50 % of the time in direct sunlight ( depending on distance ) I used it to shoot my daughter 50 feet away under some trees and it worked . One point to take away is that you need line of sight ; even indoors , if you place the camera in portrait mode ( having the camera sideways)make sure that the STE-2 is on the correct side ; for example , i was shooting a talent show and I had the flash on a stand on the left side of the stage ; I was in the middle of the auditorium , and all worked great ; except when I placed the camera in portrait mode with the STE-2 to the right , so my hand and the lens were blocking the line of sight from the STE-2 to the flash . In conclusion , I highly recommend the STE-2 as a great way to start with wireless flash .
5 #### We some case for the money . Integrated kickstand works well . No complaints here at all . Very happy with this case
5 #### I purchased these lights based on the reviews , and I was not disappointed . The quality of the wiring , connectors , relay , and hardware is excellent . Every single wire comes with a weatherproof or covered connector . The cable lengths are more than adequate , about 6 feet for one light and 8 feet for the other . Each light has its own dual wire ( positive and negative ) runs back to the relay . The wiring to the switch , that controls the relay is also about 8 feet . The switch has a small green LED that illuminates when ON . In order for the switch LED to work you have to connect it to ground ( the ground wire which is provided is about 2 feet long with connectors on both ends . The switch can be mounted to the provided bezel , or you can put it through a 3/8 " hole , your choice . Each light has about a 6 " long pig tail with a very sturdy single connector ( different than the picture in the description which shows two separate wires ) . I much prefer the pigtail connectors I received .
5 #### I ordered this along with mats and seat covers and I was most happy with this . Its a good fit , thick and easy to put on . Nice design and does n't rip or peal shipped same day
5 #### This arrived late and had to purchase local to get job done Good .. no great parts and consistent quality In 35 years I have never NEVER had one single issue with genuine motorcraft parts .
5 #### I went to auto zone and Walmart and realized I was wasting my time and money on these cheaply made grease guns reviews after reviews showed that these guns would break after a few uses . I would prefer to drop a few more dollars and get something quality and will last me . So I found this gun with great reviews and bought it . Used it a few times read the instructions and assembled the hose bought a red and tacky grease and i will tell you I was just looking for things to grease it was fun actually I worked on my truck and van and grease all the bearings and joints that required grease excellent gun and easy to use would recommend and buy again if needed .
1 #### They do not work . The locking tooth breaks with even the slightest of pressure .
5 #### Yum ! how can a guitarist not use one of these ? i love this little guy and its a always on pedal now , it has very responsive sturdy sliders that shape your tone wonderfully .. crunchy mids , smooth bass and a awesome boost pedal for your sizzling hot solos , really this is a must have if your picky about tone ! I ve got love in my tummy yum yum !
5 #### I am about to replace my stolen C2100 . It will be my third one that I have owned . This camera is a workhorse . Do n't let the 2 megapixel rating scare you . Most of my highly acclaimed photos I have taken with this camera and my other Olympus cameras are down the list in ease , quality and zoom length . Buy this camera if you can . It will not disappoint . It is especially good for " personal " and candids which require stealth . The zoom will get you incredibly close and remains the best cropping tool for reaching the latent image from a distance .
3 #### It was suggested that i use this every now and then in my engine but i have n't noticed any changes . at all . My mileage did n't go up and my engine does n't sound any better . perhaps it has qualities that i wo n't ever know about ....
5 #### Wi - Fi was getting flakey . Decided to hard wire to my LAN . Greatly improved my download speeds . Highly recommend this if your computer is close enough . Longer cables are available .
5 #### This thing is incredible . Low current draw , lots of air movement . Good white noise for sleeping ... 3 speeds also ... very high quality motor and fan blade .. nothing like the poor quality of the $ 20 box fans ..
5 #### Needed a cheap cord to listen to music in my car . Found this . Looks great , works great . The cord lies flat and is flexible . Great for the price .
5 #### this little stand is great . I am looking at it right now , across the room , holding my Zager guitar . it is light , non obtrusive , holds the guitar well , and it is portable when Mr. Guitar and I take a trip together . I highly recommend it . keeps that guitar off the bed , floor , table or anywhere else it is not really suposed to be .
5 #### I work in Lower Manhattan and my office looks out on to Upper NY Harbor . I bought these binocs to look at the boats , helicopters , etc . , that regularly pass by . The binocs are perfect for their intended purpose . I have n't used them at any concerts or other events but anticipate that they will be equally effective . A great bargain for the casual user .
5 #### I am a mouse addict to begin with and have owned plenty trying to find the perfect one . This is the only one without a ball and the best . There are no annoying jumps when the ball gets dusty and no need to purchase a mouse pad that prevents dust . The Imouse works perfectly and I have n't had a problem for over 1 year ! The best 50 bucks I ever spent and I threw my other mice away . In response to the editorial review , the thumb buttons are great and once you get used to them you will wonder how you used the internet without them . One of the best products Microsoft has ever built and it is amazing that of all companies , Microsoft comes up with such an ingenious product . You will not be dissapointed .
5 #### I have been wanting a lens that did what this baby can do . Very pleased with the quality and for the price .
5 #### Personally I like this one better than the Metal Zone . The DS1 suites my style much better . Boss seems to build a quality long lasting product and I am very pleased . I also have the NS2 and MT1 pedals and they are absolutrly great .
1 #### I ordered 10 cable based on the pictures , but end up received something totally different . I would recommend buyers stay away from this . What you get will not be the same as on the advertised picture .
5 #### I 'm impressed with these strings . They do n't sound much different to me , but they definitely live up to their claims of less squeaking . They also seem to require less tuning . They are easy to install , and have a coating that helps reduce friction and I like the way they feel . They cost more , but they should last much longer , so it all evens out .
5 #### 5200 , Is what you need for above or below the water line in your boat . A little tip if the tube is hot the sealant can be some what runny , so if you store in in the fridge for a few min , it will be a lot easier to apply .
5 #### Worked great for setting up my computer . Did not need a long cord so this fit
5 #### Usually I would have to make multiple orders cause I have a habit of getting the protectors all scratched up . The one 's I got from here seem like they last longer cause they 're harder to scratch . These are not as flimsy as the ones they sell in 5pc or 10pc . These are also smudge proof !
5 #### I realize there are several self help DIY mechanical literature available for this specific or even somewhat like vehicles available Bentley , Chilton etc . but I would say , without a doubt that this book is all you need period . sure the other manuals are in color and give you 3000 steps to the point of a headache but for 20 $ i can say anyone with basic motor skill functions should be able to get 20 times their moneys worth .
4 #### Battery fits tight , this is good . Back cover does n't fit nearly as well . My S5 keeps showing the error that I need to secure the back cover . It only does this on a restart of the phone so it is n't that annoying but the back cover could be a little more substantial . I believe that this would assist this issue .
5 #### High quality very resilient pick , great for any type of music . I like these picks for flat picking , Blues , Rock & jazz . The .73 mm pick is the one I use for all my music weather playing Electric or Acoustic Guitar ...
5 #### This item was just as described in the ad and arrived on time . It is nice to get a Great Deal .
3 #### This case did n't hold the phone tightly on my belt using the clip . As one might expect the " loose " clip broke after a month . Fortunately it has loops too , so it 's still usable .
5 #### Works great with my Lenovo W520 running Windows7 . Just remember that the drive needs to be formated via Administrative Tools - > Computer Management - > Storage - > Disk Management . Otherwise the drive will not show up in Windows . If your laptop has an available mSATA slot ( most recent ones do ) , this a fantastic way of expanding hard drive your storage . Some laptops have its mSATA slot occupied with something else ( e.g. WAN adapter for cell use ) , but if you 're not using it , swap - out with this baby and you 're good to go . Saves from having to use an ultra - bay for a 2.5 - inch SATA SSD . This brand is relatively unknown to me , but from the brief research I 've done , it 's been getting very good reviews . So far it 's working great !
5 #### I got these when re - stringing my Epiphone Les Paul and went for the mediums specifically for slide . They are excellent tone and - as always - represent a high - quality product . Because I have always been highly satisfied with D'Addarios for electrics , acoustic , and my basses , I make sure to stay with this brand . The nickel round - wounds have just the right tonal range . There are probably other good strings out there , but D'Addario will never disappoint you - just stay with ordering them every time and you will be happy !
5 #### More than adequate for its intended use ! Compared to the bags available at the " stealerships " , they are just as good and 35 % less expensive . If you do n't find yourself desperately in " need " of a motorcycle brand logo , then THIS is the bag for you ! I have over 100 helmets ( with various makes of bags for protection ) , and these bags are as up to the task as all of the others .
4 #### I bought the headset specifically for DialPad and it works excellent for my needs . I have a Creative Labs Sound Blaster 64 and a DSL line and I call my Grandma in Montana every couple days and it sounds good and has no problems .
1 #### I bought it and I had to return it because the battery does n't fit right on the contacts . Then I bought another one and had to return it too for the same issue .
5 #### I really like the ' snagless ' feature on this one . I 've broken off so many of the little clips on other ethernet cables . I think this will be much better protected . The length is good . I can sit in an easy chair near my desk with the laptop , and the cord reaches , but it 's not so long to be cumbersome when I 'm working on the desk .
4 #### These are great for my eight year old daughter , she 's beginning guitar and I wanted to lower the action on her guitar as much as possible and give her a light string for easy fretting . The strings sound great and feel smoother than regular strings ( less string noise and fewer blisters ) . I noticed a slight drop in brightness , over conventional strings but it 's not enough to bother me - bone or brass bridge pins can bring that back in spades if it 's a problem .
3 #### Mine broke only a few weeks aftter getting and now the RCA plugs are stuck in the ports . It worked well while it lassted but do n't apply to much lateral force to it .
5 #### Works perfect for my LED headlight battery pack . I ve used it for a month now with not a problem . I just followed the directions and it works .
1 #### I installed this on my 08 f350 . It was really tight , what helped to install it was putting it in the microwave for 1 min so it came out pretty warm . i 'll try to explain how i put it on , first put the bottom of it over the steering wheel and hold it with your leg so it does n't slip off or shift around . Then you want to unroll the cover to lay flat on top of the steering wheel then roll it over the wheel . It might be hard to visualize . It did n't seem like it was going to fit at first but it did go on and was nice and snug . We will see how it holds up , my last cover fell apart in a month ( all the stitching came apart ) i might change my stars on this one if the same thing happens but so far so good . update , so i have had this for a couple of weeks now and i have decided that i hate it . The diamond part is uncomfortable on the hands ( and i have construction worker hands ) also it was so poorly made that where the seams come together there was sharp vinyl that would cut my hand when turning the wheel fast . it was removed and tossed out already .
1 #### The leads I replaced with this set were 18 inches shorter . This lead set is 1.5 meters long . The extra length is like having spaghetti wire mess to contend with if you do n't need it , which I do n't . I get my meter out and put it away like 50 times a day and the extra length is simply a hassle . I wrap my leads up neatly and take care of them . I tried to get a shorter lead set that was compatible with the accessories in this kit and found that there are none in existence . I checked with Fluke , and they were not helpful as usual . I love Fluke tools but 800 pound gorillas do n't care about their customers . Now I 'm looking for a similar probe tip accessory set from another manufacturer whom also offers the shorter leads . I have had outstanding customer service from UEI whom deserves recognition for that , and will be trying to buy from companies who do provide that service after the sale if possible . I ca n't help but feel the money spent on this set is a waste , because of incompatibility and suitability to my application . If you use or like longer leads , then I would tell you to buy it because I love the probe tips and the quality .
5 #### Good for weather resistant installation . Appears to be quality materials and construction
5 #### Elixir are my go - to strings . Long life , great sound . I prefer the nanoweb as the polyweb seem a bit oily and slippery to me . I tend to use the phosphor bronze on my smaller body guitar ( Martin OM ) . The phospor bronze also sounds good on my Taylor , since it tones down the natural brightness of the taylor ... but still use the 80 - 20 bronze on my Taylor dreadnaught . It is all a matter of personal taste .
2 #### I use these for my desk in my cube but each one ( ordered 2 ) has a wierd deformed spot toward one end of it , because of this distortion it was giving me a headache just out of my peripheral . Due to this I had to take one of the mirrors down just to ease my headaches . I still have one up but if I knew they all had this deformed spot I would 've either looked elsewhere or done a few flat mirrors . I guess it is what you get for wanting something cheap .
1 #### Did n't really like it cause it never worked . It never opened up I mean come on . Tried every ways to make it start .
5 #### This neat gadget allows the cable to plug in directly without bending at the connector junction and it will help maintain the integrith of that part of the cable . Now i need to find a Left Angle Adapter for another application .
3 #### Works pretty well . Used it to route cables to satellite speakers in a 5.1 system . Main problem is the corner pieces do n't snap together very well . They kept popping off which was annoying . I should have glued them , but we 've moved from that house since then and I left them attached .
4 #### Sound is great for such an Extremely lightweight headphone ; Construction durability remains to be seen . Very fold - able / portable . Love - Hate wear procedure - bit of a nuisance : Because of the thin , spring headband , you Must spread out the earpieces all the way ( you ca n't just slip them over your head and ears ) ; wear the headset ; and Then tighten the head band and click - adjust the Comfort buttons to get a good fit . Great $ value with KOSS ' Lifetime replacement warranty . Appeared flimsy on first blush , but on the other hand , it is very flexible and should survive most abuse . However as mentioned in other reviews , the cable insertion points at the ear pieces do appear vulnerable - fragile and Should have strain - reliefs which is present at the plug - end of the cable ( Note for KOSS ) .
5 #### I was getting tired of telling the kiddo to be careful opening the car door and dinging the garage wall . This product was just what the doctor ordered . I installed two for the driver and driver side passenger . I first had to pull my 4 - door sedan in the garage to measure where both driver & passenger side doors hit the wall and did the same for our SUV . I just split the difference where the door contacts the wall on both vehicles and installed to the wall with screws . I did not screw into a stud because of the placement and length of the door protector . So far it has been working perfectly fine with both cars and I can always secure it better if it becomes a problem later . It looks a lot better with the door protectors hanging there compared to dings on my wall and drywall on my door edge .
5 #### this is a high end model featuring the most fantastic features of a bluetooth device the stylish boom will help you feel comfortable and ensure the bluetooth is on and in function the sound and noise reduction is perfect the price and everything around is a real breeze still enjoying it . competive price for business and industrial
4 #### I love the case . The plastic parts are sturdy enough to take a fall without cracking . The case is hard to get off . I have a car dash mount . But the protection is well worth it .
5 #### Works great with my Samsung Galaxy S-5 . Sound is clear on both my end and the other caller 's end . Also use it to stream music . Very happy with this purchase .
3 #### There are n't too many 1.5 mm picks out there , but this is one of them . This batch I received was n't of the best quality . The edges are n't finished nicely . It did not affect playing or tone , but you can clearly see these picks were punched out , and not deburred . The 1.14 I ordered along with these were cut fine , but I was n't impressed with these . I 'll still use them .
5 #### These lights are a lot brighter than what was originally on my Honda CRV .
5 #### I have used this Brother M231 tape before , and it works fine . It is easy to load and work with .
5 #### These are great fuses - plated for corrosion resistance and fairly inexpensive when you consider the protection they confer . I use them with the Scosche EWFH Single ANL Fuse Holder in vehicle DC systems when I 'm hooking up a bunch of amps . Amps , solar panels , deep - cycle batteries - they 're all the same . They all need to be fused if you do n't want to turn your battery system into an arc welder . The Raptor fuses come in a variety of amperages , are easy to install and do the job .
4 #### I bought this item because I misplaced my old adapter for the 1st generation iPhone . I expected , as usual , that as soon as I bought a replacement the old one would show up ! In this case it did n't . This adapter is used to connect headphones or audio output to the original 1st gen . iPhone . That model had a recessed jack to plug in the headphones and would not accept a standard plug , like the newer iPhones do . Since I am now using the 3rd gen . iPhone , my 1st two are jailbroken to use as iPod Touches , for music , internet and app use . This jack comes in handy when connecting headphones , as the 1st gen . iPhone has a sub - par speaker , and is of little use in listening to music . I would recommend it for anyone still using the original iPhone .
4 #### I had a strange problem and this device solved it nicely . My Sony TV has a headphone out jack I wanted to use it to drive a subwoofer . Having a subwoofer can add to the drama of some programs . Anyway , the headphone out volume ( signal ) is too hot and I needed a way to turn it down . This device worked very well for my need . I dropped one star because the volume knob is a bit too sensitive .
4 #### The bracket is a little longer than I 'd like , but it is easily cut and filed to fit . Nothing more than is required is included .
4 #### These reeds are better than Rico normal ones . My overall sound just got better . Fast shipping and great service at Amazon .
5 #### Fit cup holders in a 2013 Ford Edge perfectly ! we still use it for GPS on our phones , etc .
3 #### I bought this to use in my RV but tried it first in my car . Since I was more concerned with its ability to increase the data signal I placed my Verizon hotspot in the cradle and went to some local weak signal areas . I found that the booster only increased the strength of the signal by a small amount and , when I tried it in my RV , there was almost no increase at all . I had followed the instructions and placed a ferrous metal ground plane on the ( fiberglass ) roof of my RV and placed the magnetic antenna in the middle of that . I then found , at most , about a 6 - 10 dB increase using this system , but that was about the same as just connecting one of my existing magnetic antennas on the ground plane and connecting it , without the booster , to the hotspot so I saw no significant increase from using the booster . I have since returned it and purchased the 4G - M version instead . I did not expect to receive the specified 23 dB increase but I did expect to see more than I got from an unamplified antenna .
5 #### 2 days of use now and I really like it.looks quite decent and very well worth the money and would give 5 stars once it proves to be protective enough to do the job . Update : NOW 5 STARS , GOOD VALUE !
4 #### This Is Cool How ever it was too low could n't See my Phone . I wish it could extend higher
4 #### It was a great deal , , I would keep buying ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It was worth the wait Happy happy happy happy happy
5 #### Not a lot you can say . It was the right length and worked fine . 2 straight 1/4 " guitar plugs and a 10 ' shielded cord between .
5 #### Its a charger That did its job for Magellan Roadmate . Price also was great . No comlaints here . Don , t have any thing else to say
1 #### It says that it fits the Ipod 60 GB and it does not . Very disappointed with it . Very upset about it
3 #### These look better than the black plastic pins . But , not as musical as the boxwood pins . The best use for these is they dampen some of the string unwanted resonance on a 12 - String guitar . I find ebony pins a little too dense for 6 - string service .
5 #### I love the versatility of this stand . It stores my Droid 4 in either the vertical or horizontal position , has channels and clips to route cables and keep them in place , and has a rubberized base that stays in place nicely . If you charge your phone in the horizontal position and your charging port is on the bottom of your phone , you may want to invest in a low profile or right - angle plug . I do n't think there 's enough clearance between the bottom of the phone and the stand for a full sized micro plug . Of course , you could simply flip your phone over and put the charging port on top , but that would be WAY too inventive .
5 #### It worked . Kept the smells at bay in the Chemical toilet
5 #### great for running an interface to a mixer , or a mixer to amplifiers . normally if you run more than four cables , things start to get a little messy . a recording snake like this one keeps things neat , color organized , and cost less than it would cost to buy eight 6.5 foot cables .
3 #### A definite improvement over the old battery which had to be charged twice a day just to stay on . Holds a charge for 2 - 3 days ( original was 4 - 5 days ) . However will die suddenly without warning . The old battery would beep several times over about 20 to 30 minutes before shutting down . This one only beeps once , maybe , then shuts off 5 min later . But like I said it definitely holds a charge for much longer , and at that price it 's hard to beat . So , overall positive .
5 #### Fit GREAT with out having to do any drilling as it said , and LOOKS AWESOME
4 #### I just received my case and more than pleased with the construction , it fit my HTC vivid with hard case . Really like the Velcro flap more secure than magnet on my old case
5 #### I purchased these headphones based on reviews I have read . I listen to my walkman in bed and found that these are a real comfort on my head while laying in bed listening to a tape or music . It seems that the headphones mold to any position that you are in and the sound is great . Thanks Amazon[.com]for a great product .
5 #### Already had a pair of these for my Chapman ML-3 Modern ( weighty beast at about 9.8 - 10 pounds ) and they 've been holding up GREAT , so I bought a second set for my Strat . I had the balls scared off me when the strap slipped off my baby and she almost went right to the floor ... I caught her with my foot ( ouch ) , just in time to save her , but I immediately went shopping for locks , and got a pair of these from a local shop . If you 're at a toss up between these and the Schaller variety , try to find some you can get your hands on and just compare them . A friend of mine loves Schaller and says Dunlops are terrible . I like the Dunlops fine and ca n't find a problem with the Schallers either , so it 's all up to personal preference , until something fails , and they have n't failed me yet ! I 'll be getting a third set to put on another guitar , and any other future guitars will likely have them as well .
4 #### This is a nicely priced case for your Blackberry curve , although frankly I 'm torn vs. the Blackberry - branded case . The GOOD : - the rotating clip is strong , and appears to be stronger than the clip of the OEM case . I 've had to replace two of the OEM cases for my Blackberry curve because the rotating clip snapped off when hit the wrong way . - the list price , although with discounts the difference is negligible vs the OEM case The NOT - SO - GOOD : - case fit is definitely not as snug as the OEM Blackberry case . There is a noticeable gap and a bit of room on this case - leather quality is OK but not up to the finish of the OEM case The INDIFFERENT : - the magnetic clip is bigger than the OEM case , and it fits into an indented area so it does n't stick out as much as the OEM case . On the OEM case , the clip is smaller , but it clips directly to the outside of the case and does n't require you to hit the exact space . Given the equivalent price , I 'll probably continue to purchase the OEM case given its better leather quality and fit .
5 #### I 'm not sure what to say . It holds the guitar and appears to do it well . It is more cumbersome than the one on my air guitar .
5 #### I have used this for 10 + years to dry my car after washing , as well as a few other spills . I just bought another one , because my other one that I have been using for over 10 years disappeared . When you are done using it , just wring it out and put it back in the plastic tube damp and it is ready to go for the next time . Works much much better than a real chamois . Made in Japan ( not China ! )
1 #### Could not get over 3 PSI and was closer to 1 PSI . Engine would not run over an idle . Called Holley tech line and they concluded the pump was defective . Returned the pump . On the positive side , , , , Amazon did promptly refund the cost and shipping , as well as return shipping . Although the Holley pump was defective , , I am very happy with Amazon and the return action .
1 #### Terrible lens , Canon should be ashamed of themselves for even making this piece of junk . The focus is unreliable and noisey , at F/5.6 @ 300 mm you need tons of light to use a high enough shutter speed to remove any camera shake . I had one of these lenses for around 2 - 3 weeks and got rid of it , was lucky enough to walk into a local Pawn Shop and get the far superior Canon EF 70 - 300 mm IS USM for the same price as this garbage . The 70 - 300 mm IS USM takes way better photos , gives fantastic bokeh and color in your images and just outperforms this lens in every way . Save your money , if shooting with a crop body , get the EF - S 55 - 250 mm with IS , which is only a few dollars more and takes way better photos or get a 70 - 300 mm from someone like Tamron or Sigma if you can not afford the 70 - 300 IS USM .
5 #### Great product used it on my leather carrying case which was discolored and looked as it was losing its luster . After applying it it made it look like almost new and looked much much better . Was happy with the result obtained . It is multi purpose as I also use it on my shoes to recondition the leather and on my belts and the rubber strips on my car specially to protect them from the harsh winter .
5 #### I bought a pair of these for my travel trailer . They fit fine and snug up nicely with the tire . While having a lanyard for them sounds tempting , I hate having extraneous parts on my chocks , so I like their simplicity .
4 #### used to back boat trailer bearings and it worked great
1 #### Cheap construction . Vibrates while driving . If you try to tighten the mirror the cheap pot metal bolt breaks . Yes , the bolt is made of pot metal . Mirror surface is wavy . A far cry from factory quality .
4 #### They 've stopped making polaroid film , and the expected final availability ( according to polaroid 's web site ) is the first quarter 2009 . At this point in time , I 'd think the main interest would be in artistic work with the film . Check the expiration dates , and get some before the era comes to a complete close .
5 #### Lightweight and gets the job done . My last PC680 lasted almost five years . This new AGM battery is just a bit lighter .
4 #### I have had this armband for about a week and 1/2 now . I do really like it ! easy in and out of the phone , and it seems to be secure . My only design improvements would be some kind of cable guide for your headphone wire , and possibly a little more sturdy , but that of course , would make it heavier . Also know , it will hold the phone only , not in a case ... even a slim one . I have a casemate " barely there " case and ( pretty slim ) and have to remove the phone to put in the band . Other than that , It 's great for the price ! ! ! Heck , great for any price .
5 #### I bought these binoculars for my husband , who had lost his last pair in the woods . The size and weight , and the fact that these fold down small were at least as important as the magnification in my selection . He uses binoculars to scout game before and during hunting season , and did n't want a big pair of binoculars hanging around his neck or filling a coat pocket . I use them at home to watch the birds at my birdfeeders . I like that they are manual - focus , and that they 're adjustable for different face sizes . They are a nice mid - range magnification - a good balance between size and power . When we 're done with them , they fold up slim and small , and store neatly in the included pouch .
2 #### I purchased these chargers for my wife 's cell phone . The home charger and USB charger work fine , however , the car charger does not work . The little red light glows , indicating it is receiving power fron the car , however it does not charge the phone . So in effect , 2 out of 3 ai n't bad .
4 #### This was well priced , sturdy , easy to install . You have to mount it on a stud in the wall . The mount joints are stiff . Even though there is a generous pack of screws of various lengths and washers , I still had to improvise to mount the television . Good value
5 #### This stopped my problem with my wireless router kicking my hard wired connection . I had to restart both routers often . Now I have a dedicated wire to 2 bedrooms , AT&T Micro - cell and wireless router ! Better than I thought , have n't been kicked since I hooked it up . The 5 ports consists of 1 input and 4 output . I 'm very pleased with this switch and highly recommend it .
5 #### A nice concept that actually works , The cable is very nice , too with an adequate gauge . Try it out for yourself !
1 #### Of the four charging doors I bought none of them work as directed . I have yet to be able to charge a phone .
4 #### These tapes work well - have had no problems whatsoever . In the absence of TiVo and DVD Recorders , blank VHS tapes like this one does the job .
5 #### I like these because the sound is good and the headphones do n't crush my ears or head .
5 #### This is a must have shutter release for anyone really . Obviously it 's great for long exposure shots to reduce shake , but it 's also great because you can lock it on BULB or to take continuous shots at any shutter speed . I 've had my Canon RS60 for about 5 years and it 's still working . Originally got it for my Rebel 2000 and carried it over when I got my Rebel XSi . It 's an absolute must have . I also have the Canon RC-6 wireless remote and I can say that it 's really only designed for that one person who never makes into the group photo . In order to use the RC-6 you have to hit the infrared sensor from the front and it can only be synced with the camera with a shutter delay . That 's why the RS60 is much better than the RC-6 .
5 #### The Belkin cables are well made . I 've found them consistently solid in all that I 've purchased from them .
5 #### I used this on a car with 2 year old K&N filter . The car was n't driven much , but I thought I clean it anyway . It 's really easy . Spray on cleaner , wait 10 minutes , then spray with water . Dry , then spray on the red oil . Much easier using oil spray instead of the other type . My car has 2 K&N air filters , and I used 2/3 of both cleaners and oil spray . So I can use this kit for one more . However I was more than generous ( or spray - happy ) . I 'm sure I could 've easily use this kit on two filters twice ( 4 total ) , instead of 3 filters .
4 #### Nice replacement mirror . Had one minor speck on it that is in the mirror . Not a big deal and it is hard to see once it was installed . Good heavy duty material .
4 #### The price is great for a rack DB meter , But ... 2 issues make this unit a bit disappointing . 1 . The meter 's l.e.d.s DIM when in bar mode ! You would think the designer would have seen this & provided an ample power supply so this was n't an issue ! The power supply is 1000ma which should be plenty for what this unit needs ! 2 . The l.e.d.s light up in PAIRS , - so each decibel increment lights up 2 ( TWO ) l.e.d.s at once ( -NOT each l.e.d . at a time . ) I prefer the dot mode , so the dimming is not a problem in this mode . The plastic enclosure is fine & the construction is good , if it were not for the above mentioned faults I would be raving about this product ! ! ! ! Cheers ! Ringo
5 #### Nice large can , works well in my kitchen torch . Shipping was a bit slow but it got here in 1 piece so no big deal .
2 #### cracked as soon as it was put on , very flimsy .
5 #### the best deal for OEM Part . fits great , and cost less than third party stuff . Suv can breath now . I am saving on gas after replacing this filter , recommended highly .
5 #### I only use this cable for charging my cell phone from my computer when I am out in the field and using my computer in my jeep . That way I do n't have to clutter up the power point outlet with a bunch of different cords / chargers . Harold
5 #### If you ever need to switch your SIM card do it yourself with this tool do n't pay some $ 10 - $ 20 when u can do it yourself for a fraction of their price
1 #### I 've done a before and after recording and what I can say is that there is no noticeable improvement . I am currently using it on a Samsung note 2 and the worst reception is in my house downstairs . Downstairs I will get 1 - 2 bars inconsistently before putting on the sticker . After putting it on , it was exactly the same . I 've even reset the phone and tested it for 8 hours keeping tracking of the bars and there was no increase in performance . I do not recommend this at all . Stay away from these . It works as well as putting a power ranger sticker on the back of your phone .
5 #### I received this as part of a promo after buying a keyboard case for my ipad mini . Works great , it charges my iphone quicker than plugging it into a laptop or wall . It still has about 3 or 4 bars left after charging my iphone from about 30 % to 100 % . Usually charging my ipad will drain the charger but it 's convenient when I 'm headed out the door and do n't have time to charge . I carry it with me just about everywhere . Highly recommend it .
5 #### These harness kit wires are getting thinner and thinner , but this kit worked perfectly for my 2009 Ford Ranger Sport Pickup .
5 #### I probably could have got by with the 2 ton stands instead of 3 tons . These things are solid . I feel safe and they are really a breeze to use .
5 #### awesome strings that do n't tarnish .... worth the extra couple of bucks because they do n't get tarnished or rusty from finger grease / sweat
2 #### It 's a cheap mirror for a cheap price . It 's chromed plastic , and probably wo n't last long . I 'm not even going to bother putting them on my car . Luckily , I 'm only out $ 10
4 #### Cheap and good so far . I like to have these type things delivered to my door , instead of going in a cell phone shop or mall . I do n't like the hassle in those places .
5 #### Have switched all my guitars to Ernie Ball strings .. Electrics and acoustics .. They have a great tone and i am happy with all the different types of strings made by them ! !
2 #### I like the overall look of the case . I have it in several colors . But the piece of plastic across the charging port breaks way too easy .
5 #### Works just like it 's suppose to do ! ... I drive charter bus and need my GPS ... And my electronic log plugged in at the same time !
5 #### We love these little Zenergy chimes ! The sound is pure and loud , and the presentation with the wooden base , aluminum rods and little mallot is quite beautiful . Buy one , you wo n't regret it at all . We bought our first set of these , the Zenergy5 with five chimes , as a bit of a lark . They rapidly became a favorite , which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time . The chimes sat on an end table , and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them . We lost the five - note chimes after we had a party and our house , and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them . At the end , we gave the chimes to him , which delighted him , and of course delighted us as well . The next day , we purchased the Zenergy3 three - rod version of the chimes , simply to have something different . We are equally happy with the three - tone chime . Hint : Be sure to shop around ! Vendors offer these chimes here on Amazon at a variety of price points , including shipping .
5 #### These headphones are sooo comfortable , this is the most important feature ... Sound quality is amazing , true sound . Not " enhanced " like other manufacturers do .
4 #### Worked well for a project guitar a just put together . Note , I do n't believe these are actual Fender product but a Chinese counterfeit .
5 #### I use this for voice over recording . The tonal quality is warm and pleasing while rejecting quite a bit of background noise from nearby computer fans . Solid build quality . It looks and sounds like a much more expensive mike . Only when you get into mikes costing four times as much do you begin to get better sound quality , and even then , it 's subjective and not a drastic difference . You simply ca n't find anything else even close to the sound and build quality of this mike for 100 dollars .
4 #### Product is ok . This is a very thin pick so be warned if you are just looking for regular thin . This one gives a lot and is not good for picking .
2 #### The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out . there is no adjustment for it , so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall , or when it was out . i do not recommend this wall mount . to it 's benefit though , it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install .
5 #### If you 've ever used Elixirs , you wo n't be reading this . They sound fantastic and last nearly forever . I never buy anything else .
4 #### I acquired an Epiphone Thunderbird IV at a local guitar place . It came with a hardshell case and all for $ 249 , which was a great price for what I got . And what I got was a great bass , which had a good tonal range but always sounded warm and never ... piercing . Sometimes , when a person is looking for a punchy bass sound they end up sounding piercing . I never had any fret buzz or problems with the hardware . This guitar looks very close to its Gibson counterpart , though they differ , mainly in the fact that the Epiphone has a bolt - on neck . Despite having the widely considered inferior bolt - on , this bass has some great sustain . In fact , my only complaints about the insturment were that it was awkward to play while sitting down . It was n't THAT bad , for those of you who 've played a " V " sitting down , but it did take getting used to . My only " real " complaint then is , as another reviewer stated , the guitar is head - heavy and will tip down a bit if you let go of the neck momentarily . Once my neck swung down and smaked the floor ! But its built tough , and there was n't a ding or a nick .
3 #### I ordered two pairs of these strings for my wife ( a 23 - year violin player ) to use while practicing . One of the strings in the first set broke right away , literally within five minutes . The second set went on okay and have been fine for a couple of months now . They seem like a fine deal for the price , but it would n't hurt to have a backup set handy just in case .
1 #### I just had to chime in to wave anyone off from buying this . This cover is not tight , it slips around and easily starts to come off . I have ordered something else and will picth this asap .
5 #### RaggTopp Fabric Protectant is a wonderful product . I 've been using RaggTopp product for years with great success . After using the cleaner and protectant , my top looks like new !
5 #### Excellent product . Cleans well . I use it on a hot tub cover and truck tonneau cover .
3 #### Once we hooked it up , I could tell my phone had a couple more bars . It really did improve our cell service , but was n't amazing like I thought it would be . My husbands phone was the worst . Since we live in the woods , he had no service at all . AFter using the booster , he was up to 2 -3 bar . So yes it does work !
5 #### I got this so I could run a GPS and a dash cam at the same time off my lighter socket , which it does without problem .
5 #### Did the job . Connected it to printer and computer and worked flawlessly . Not much to say .
5 #### Do n't know why I waited so long to spruce up my boat , as this stuff is great . The thick gel goes and stays where you put it , cures quick , sets hard , and sands flush easily . I also purchased white , black , brown and yellow coloring agent to match my gel coat very closely . Trial and error mixing of small batches without the hardener , will allow you to dab on the boat , compare and then wipe off . Keep in mind that this has no tint , so unless matching a colored hull , you will be mainly be adding white . Once I had a feel for the ratio , using a small putty knife , I mixed up roughly 1 ounce globs on a mixing board . A dab of white and then toothpicks to drag in just enough of the other colors to match the off white hull color . A little goes a long way ! I used Scotch tape to seal and level these small surface repairs , with a piece on the back side for screw holes . There is some technique to it and took me a few tries to perfect it and minimize sanding . Check out the many YouTube how to videos . It really is easy and worthwhile ... give it a try .
5 #### Well made , used large strap hinges to acquire proper angle for six foot ramps .
5 #### I will put it to good use . Looks like duck hunters mike like this one also
5 #### This not only looks great but is very comfortable on the hands . Its a bit hard to get on at first but once you stretch it out a bit its easy .
5 #### I wanted a Bluetooth that was easy to use , and this one is . It does n't have all the bells and whistles that some of the more expensive ones have . And that is what made it perfect for me .
3 #### It appears that the material , on the bottom , is not going to last very long . After a couple of months of service , there are small holes in the fabric .
5 #### Do n't know how you would get the crankshaft pulley off of your Honda Accord without this . But , with it - piece of cake ... O.K. , maybe not quite that easily ; still needed a 1/2 " breaker bar and a 5 foot long cheater pipe added to it !
3 #### The product does work as advertised , however ; I had a difficult time installing the drivers during the setup process . I 'm running Windows ME , and noticed that the manufacture placed the drivers in the windows " inf " directory , not the system directory which is generally the default . So , after manually pointing to the proper directory the product installed without fault . The product was recognized as a " General Purpose USB Hub " and created two new drive letters . This allows tremendous versatility . You can open and edit pictures directly on the " smart media " memory card or simply copy them to your local hard drive . Overall , I would recommend this product to friends , but gave it a 3 because the manufacture needs better support ( i.e. FAQ pages ) and automated installation .
2 #### These work good for the low price , and the easy over head use , but sadly my head is way smaller than what these are intended for , would n't work for children then either . They 're adjustable , but even on the smallest setting there s a huge gap leaving it not snug and easy to move around with them on :/
4 #### The AT92e cartridge tracks and sounds MUCH better than it should for this price . The sound is a bit on the bright side , which will match well with systems that sound slightly dull . Tracks very well , with minimal tracing distortion . Separation is better than expected with proper set - up . The only caution is that ( as others have commented ) , the suspension is rather soft , and compliance is high . This means the AT92e needs to be used in very light weight , low - mass tone - arms , or tracking of warped records will likely lead to bottoming out of the cartridge against the vinyl , and loads of woofer cone wobble . For the price however , if you have an arm that 's a good match , you will be very happy with the sound . It 's quite a bargain ! If you have an arm that has more mass , or a changer that requires heavier tracking forces , you might wish to look at cartridges more like the Stanton 500 series , which are a better match for higher mass arms , and heavier tracking changers .
5 #### I LOVE THIS STUFF MY WHITE AUTO LOOK VERY GOOD WITH THIS STUFF , WHEN I SAY GOOD MY WHITE AUTO VERY GOOD ( YOU HAVE A BLESS DAY )
3 #### It was a long shot as the evaporator was leaking in my girlfriend 's Dodge truck ... It did n't work , but one can always hope !
5 #### These are great little stands for my Miata . I like the lock pins .
5 #### i just replaced all the hubcaps on my nissan altima with this , and the lugnuts all came off pretty easy . though 3 did get stuck in the wrench . An easy fix to that is to hit the side of the stuck part against the wall of the city sidwalk . A few hits and it just pops right out no problem . Besides that its really good , and the different sizes were needed to pop out the tires due to tire locks in place
5 #### If you own a motorcycle , you need one of these . It has come in so handy , so many times . You never know when you might need one and these things are awesome !
1 #### As others have noted , and I should of paid more attention to , the pieces are way smaller than the description . Why does n't Amazon correct this so people are n't deceived ? Pretty much worthless except for one very small wire .... one 16Ga speaker wire yes , two would be iffy . Almost impossible to snap open or closed once in place .... I would not recommend . I returned my order to Amazon .
2 #### Height is not adjustable . For the price it is not acceptable .
5 #### Works . This will boost your signal and sometimes even get you service were you would otherwise have none . I would rather have spent the extra to have a more seamless installation in my car . The antenna wire is tougher than it looks but gets it the way .
5 #### Best strings on the planet in my opinion .. They last around 6 months a set for me and that 's around 3 to 4 hours of playing everyday
5 #### Use on couches , shoes , jackets , gloves , car seats , purses and anything else leather . Always been a big lexol fan . This size makes it very economical . I keep some in a spray bottle for large areas or pour into a small dish if I 'm protecting leather wear . Does not make it shine or glossy , but does nt leave a greasy feel either .
5 #### I have switched back and fourth between these and the Emporer and loved the sound had gotten . Great on the big stages , in the theatres or clubs , or just in the practice room . I reccomend it for recording , you can hear my REMO snare heads @ www.thebeggarsbest.com
1 #### I purchased this item partly for the screen cover but also to have a travel power charger . It came with a connector for the car and wall plug . What it did n't have was any cord . That seems rather useless to me since I have to always have the other charger with me to use this . The wall plug seems rather redundant since it appears useless without the cord I already had . If I want to charge this in my car , I have to have the original cord which , otherwise , I would n't need to have in the car . Fortunately , it was n't very expensive . But pretty useless .
5 #### Product works as good as it can . If it were to break then it 's probably the users fault or the caliper is bad .
5 #### I use this as a topper over Klasse SG and Zaino z2 . It adds a depth and liquidity to dark paints that is simply stunning . The paint literally looks like it 's still wet and running off the car . It 's on the more expensive side but one only needs to use a little bit for an entire vehicle . Definitely worth the money and extra step .
5 #### Let me just preface this mini - review by stating that I 'm not an audiophile , so in terms of these headphones on a technical level , I ca n't say much . I can say , however , that I had decided about two years ago that I needed headphones for my computer , and so I went to J&R Music and Computer World to try ones on . I tried these , and they sounded great to me , again , being a non - audiophile , and they were extremely comfy . Here it is , two years later , and the headphones still work fantastically , are still comfortable , and still sound great . They 're not noise cancelling , however if you have loud music playing , odds are you wo n't be able to hear your roommate shouting at you from behind . In addition , since I can tell the difference between say , a 256kbps MP3 and a lossless version of the same song , I can still notice the same difference on these headphones . Yes , this is a matter of audio compression , but the point I 'm trying to infer there is that even the small details of audio compression do n't go unnoticed with these headphones . Very highly recommended .
5 #### This review is for 2 mm thick big stubby , and I like it very much . It is thicker than all my other guitar pick , but I have lots of fun using this one . It is very comfortable to hold in hand . I took some photos , and you can tell this is little smaller than regular Dunlop picks , but it is bigger than Jazz III . Overall , I am very happy with this purchase ! 12/1/2016 : Update with 3.0 Big Stubby After I bought my 2.0 big stubby , I like it so much ; thus , I also bought these 3.0 ones . I really like them too , they are 1 mm thicker than 2.0 ones , and I actually like those 3.0 big stubby more . They feel solid and durable in hand . I added more photos here , and I am happy with both purchases ! If this review is helpful to you , please help me by clicking the Yes below ; this would really encourage me to give better reviews in the future . Thank you very much =)
5 #### I purchased a used , inexpensive Fender MIM Strat to use as a project . This was to be my practicing soldering , play with the trust rod , try and intonate etc . etc . just to play and screw it up . I then ordered these pickups to put on it . Dang .... this is the only guitar I play now . Open chords on overdrive sound clean , and yes I agree with all the other reviews , did not loose one bit of that Strat sound . More quiet than the Seymore Duncan Double Humbucker on my HSS RH-4 Blade . My favorite go - to guitars now are just wall dcor now .
4 #### I like my phone i got it the first day it came out and when i got it i mean it takes some getting use to but I like the features , the camera , the phone is ok not wow , love the keyboard , and i really like my windows media player on it and all the things you can do . I do n't know what most people were expecting but i think my expection of the phone is what i expected .... Until someone finds the perfect phone that has no problems , have everything you ever wanted , absolutely no issue with it and it does every possible thing , then you let me know but for now this phone is ok / good
5 #### I 'm using this for a 50/50 ATF and Acetone mix , and it seems to be holding up . The hose is fairly flexible . It will siphon the contents of the can if the tip is left bend down too low . All that said , it 's been great .
1 #### I have the 3 - CD version of this model , but aside from their CD capacity , all Philips recorders are apparently the same . I had mine for only a few months before it simply stopped recording on CDR 's I 'd been using all along . So it had to be shipped back to the factory ( where it stayed for 5 weeks ! ) , so they could " look at it . " Over a month later , I got a call from them saying that " Philips CD recorders are only designed to work with Philips exclusive CDR blank media . " My first problem with this is that apparently nobody who sells Philips recorders knows this -- or they just do n't tell you-- and Philips consumer electronics , themselves , do n't tell you in the instructions , on the box , or even at their helpline 1 - 800 number . Secondly , good luck trying to find any Philips brand CDR blank media out there , much less at a reasonable price . And even when the unit is functioning the way it should , the record times are sporadic and the computer inside the unit is fickle at best . Please use my unfortunate experiences with these CD recorders to your own benefit . Do not spend your hard - earned money on this product . I 'm sure there are other quality CD recorders out there , but I just blew my money on the wrong one .
5 #### found it to be very sturdy and does exactly as expected as advertised . I like it and use it ... try it :-)
5 #### I LOVE IT & I bought this for my boyfriend cause he was hinting that he needed one so I surprised him with it .
5 #### This was perfect for my 24 " LED monitor , I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems . It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6 ' HDMI cable which I was not expecting .
5 #### Excellent . The spring retractor works well , the clip on end to attach to radio antennae is fine as well . Necessary item for use with short wave radio and significantly extend selections of signals received . I 've taken on several trips and used in hotels and such and this thing travels well . Using with a Sony ICF - SW7600GR AM / FM Shortwave World Band Receiver with Single Side Band radio
5 #### They are clean , they work and arrived on time . Need I say more ?
5 #### I just gave this to my teenage niece and she seemed to love it . The kids need flash drives for school and if they have siblings , parents and schoolmates with drives that look the same , that could be a problem . This solves that . LOTS of designs and forms to choose from . Just search USB keychain or USB jewelry .
1 #### Bought 2 of these and they were broken before the weekend was over . Blah !
1 #### They were to small for my 96 impala but there very nice decals I 'll keep looking for a big er size
5 #### I 'm using these on the Oregon coast for whale watching . But as full time RV'ers we will be using them for all types of animal watching too .
5 #### I kept reading reviews of fog lights . Most complained that 55w was just not enough ... Seriously ? I installed these on my Ford F350 Truck and leave them OFF when driving day to day . These things are weapons ! You can seriously blind other drivers with these bad boys . How about this : I can leave my headlights off and still drive with them . * easily * I am stunned how bright these are for the $ $ .. Are there brighter ? Oh you bet but for general fog driving and wilderness / backcountry travel , these things are excellent . I can see so much more with a pair of PIAA 's complimenting my headlamps . When I go in to the forest , I can see WELL beyond regular headlamps . These dig deep in the dark to light your way . What an excellent product for the money . The main reason I chose them : The bulb can be replaced ! LESS WASTE ! yea ! The wiring was simple . The directions were clear and the kit had everything I needed except the tools . PLEASE do what the instructions say and disconnect your battery . These things have quite a draw and if you wire them funny while the circuit is hot , you can really zorch your auto . It did n't happen to me but it 's a logic thing . Do n't be a cowboy .. These are wider than 4 " so if you are putting them on a truck , keep that in mind . They are wider than a typical oval fog lamp but I believe that contributes to their brightness .
4 #### I bought these as spares ( and they look really cool too ! ) . I think everyone has used Fender Mediums at some point ; these are no different . Reliable , last a while and more important they 're inexpensive !
5 #### Almost can not believe how good these sound for the price . Do not hesitate .
5 #### This Colby Converter works fine I use it for my other coby electronics also when I am traveling in the car .
5 #### Used a wired Trackman wheel for many years ....... but gave it up when I went to a wireless keyboard and mouse combo from Microsoft . Never thought about looking for a wireless trackball ... but - here one is and I am very pleased with it .
5 #### These driving lights do a great job of Illuminating the road far ahead . They definitely extend past the range of my high beams and do not throw and excessively wide beam . The color is a nice yellow halogen , however it is not too bright in color . The build quality is is excellent and appears to be very well built . The wiring harness that comes with is fairly long , however it was not long enough for my install in my truck . Also , I was not a very big fan of the switch that it came with mainly because I prefer rocker switches . The install was very easy even without the instructions if you are basically familiar with Automotive electrical wiring . For my particular install , I chose to have it switched and running only with the high beam . It was very easy and turned out great ! PIAA makes a great product . Plus Amazon has a great deal on this relative to other vendor . If you 're interested I would definitely get this right , I do not think you will regret it ! If you have any other questions that I did not discuss work that others have not discussed Kama feel free to ask !
2 #### Updated on 4/30/2012 : This was an excellent unlocked Android phone on ATT 3G. ( This , coming from someone who foolishly purchased it directly from Google for more than $ 500 when it first came out ) . I loved loved loved this phone . Unfortunately , at twenty months it began to randomly go into a reboot loop , and become very warm at the bottom under the battery door . HTC support recommended exporting my contacts and then a factory reboot . Did that , without re - installing any of my apps , and the random reboot loops and overheating continued . The phone was undependable / unusable and out of warranty . The expense of sending it back to HTC and being without a phone for an undetermined time period was enough to make me decide to pull the SIM card and purchase another new unlocked phone ( the Samsung Nexus S , which is even better than the Google Nexus One ) . Of course , your mileage may vary .
5 #### Old school look and feel ! Much more comfortable than the old skinny hard plastic steering wheel in my ' 85 Cadillac . It looks like it belongs in the car .
5 #### Just what I was looking for , well made , will hold up being exposed to the sun and weather ...
4 #### I have lived in Phoenix , Dallas , and San Antonio and found out one thing ... no windshield wiper is going to hold up well in extreme heat . These blades are not really all that different . They were great through the first six months but started getting some of those signs of wear through the hot summer months .
5 #### I have been a Sennheiser fan for many years and still have the Sennheiser 414s from the 70s ( and they still sound great ) . I wanted a good headphone to go with my Rotel RX-1050 receiver / amplifier because it reproduces sound so beautifully . In the Sennheiser 600s I got what I wanted and then some . They are a sheer listening pleasure . As other reviewers have mentioned , they do not work well with a portable CD player and would need an amp to perform properly . They are execellent with a good home stereo but they do let you hear exactly what is on your source , so with lower quality equipment , they will sound only as good as your stuff ( garbage in , garbage out -- do n't blame the 600s ) . These earphones are the best I have ever listened to . They are a joy to use . They fit reasonably comfortably but could get warm with prolonged use . Overall they are an excellent addition to any audiophile 's equipment . My only ( minor ) gripe is the rather flimsy cable that comes standard . I am thinking of purchasing the Equinox cable ( which has gotten excellent reviews ) or making my own custom cable to further enchance the sound of these wonderful cans .
5 #### Very strong and absolutely waterproof box . It 's somewhat heavy but that speaks quality . You can run it over with a car and it wo n't break . It 's not very big so if you 're planning to put a camera and a phone in it , get a larger one .
5 #### Great product , Fits into tight places such as the space between a TV and the wall . This is a nice addition to any AV installer / engineers toolkit , it is a excellent AV RS232 control troubleshooting tool !
5 #### That guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost . It is a great pleasure to jam on it around . Sound is like it 's real big brother . Very very familiar . I suppose , it is the best choise for your kid ! All hardware is Ok . Just give some days to tuners to get used to ...
4 #### The sound produced by this unit is fabulous . Be advised though that the Nano adaptor does not work with the 5th generation Nano . If you try to use the adaptor , the 5th gen Nano will not plug into the unit completely . It will still work in the unit , you just have to stick the thick foam that is included behind the Nano to stabilize it . Also , make sure you have soundcheck turned on or the speakers sound scratchy . Once the sound check was turned on the sound was phenominal . If the price goes down to $ 39.99 again I will be buying another one .
5 #### This was one of the first pedals I owned - and I still keep one around because it is a warm , responsive and beautifully toned chorus pedal . Its also tough - takes a beating on the road , or playing on streets and subway platforms . I play what Luka Bloom called " electro - acoustic " guitar - that is acoustic with a few choice effects . This chorus is a great place for any acoustic player seeking to expand their live presence a bit , to start . A lot of new players go for multi effects pedals - and those can be great , but there is a steep learning curve , and can be a very expensive option . Start with a good chorus like this one , and then add others when your budget ( and your experience ) let you !
4 #### I have had this product for about 8 years . It works . It works pretty well . The hinges feel very flimsy but they have not broken . The locks feel cheap but they work ok . The thing does n't make much noise on the top of the car and never comes loose . It 's not waterproof and mine leaks a little in a downpour . The biggest problem is it is small . But you know that when you buy . The attachment system ( ubolts with knobs ) and the hinges cut into that small capacity and make it even smaller and more limited . If I had it to do over , I might get a bigger box . But now that I have a cargo tray and bag , I do n't need it to be bigger so it worked out ok . But you are n't going to get a lot in this box , I try to pack soft things in it , but they have to be things that can get wet .
3 #### Real simple ... this item does not fit the Bold 9650 series . When I searched for charging docks for the 9650 this item appeared . Amazon may want to check its searching criteria on this item . Good news is the phone itself sits in the dock and should fit with a silicon case as will . There is still room to charge the phone via the micro - USB port . Basically a nice decorative piece . For the price it 's not worth returning so I 'll keep it .
5 #### I love this headset . I 've been searching for it for a year and was excited to fing it on Amazon at a great price . It 's easy to operate , the clarity is great , no unwanted noise or static , and the color could't be more perfect . I am very passionate about my purple . Thanks Amazon.com .
5 #### As new products evolve they only accept SD and microSD cards . I 've had good luck with Kingston and this is no exception .
5 #### Great product ! Easy fix , Dropped right in and worked :) now I do n't have to dread the rain . It also fixed the washer spray . Thank you Dorman !
1 #### Its light and portable . But will constantly disconnect and reconnect at random . Then there are those issues when you answer a call yet you ca nt hear the other person whatsover . I m starting to think Jawbone is the better buy .
5 #### I wish I bought something like this 20 years ago . This extractor works really well and I love the pouring spout . I used it today to change the oil on my Honda Odyssey and my lawn mower . It makes the tasks so much easier than draining the oil from the drain plugs .
5 #### Great replacement for your acoustic guitar whether Martin or any brand .
5 #### These may be hand selected , as there are no losers in the package .
5 #### I have the Audio Technica ATH - M50x and only bought these because they had a big sale and I wanted to compare them . Both are great but for some reason the music on these sonys make songs sound even better . Even with the modest output of an iPhone 6 you get truly rich amazing sound . I think the strength is the rich sound and super high efficiency . The only negative is the coiled cord which is heavy and cumbersome . The ATH - M50x is a little less efficient but the cord selection is a plus . Ca n't go wrong with either one but I prefer the MDRV6 . I also have Sennheiser HD-570 and AKG 's which have a wonderful open sound stage but just not efficient enough for an iPhone . Hope this helps .
5 #### I 'm going to give 5 stars because it does everything it 's advertised to do . Low to the ground , rolls over trouble light cords and shop rags with impunity . Yes , your head rides low in the cradle like others have noted . I did n't think it was uncomfortable at all , and prefer my head lower so I can avoid getting grease on my schnozzle . Was debating between four and five stars because there are two things needed to perfect this beast : 1 . It 's too heavy - it is a beast . My old creeper was much lighter and easier to sling around and hang up out of the way . 2 . The wheel covers , or humps , are cumbersome , particularly when it 's time to hang it somewhere . My old creeper could just catch its wheels on the edge of a counter or board and it would stay . Not this one . I put a couple eye bolts on one side to catch two nails to hang on when not in use . Dale Adams still has some work to do , otherwise someone , someday , will come along with a better mousetrap . Just sayin ' . Would I buy it again ? Yes .. but I wish I could have taken this one and a half a dozen others for a test ride before choosing one .
4 #### Very nice and light , at the same time producing highly punchy sounds . I recommend to metal players . I 'm buying a 5 pair set now .
2 #### Very nice looking , easy to use . However the answer button sometimes work with my Blackberry sometimes does not . Ringing volume is very low . You will not hear it with your music on . People hear me fine but I have problems hearing them . Volume is low and sound has a lot of distortions . May be if you drive a very quiet car you might be fine . In my SUV which is not particular loud but it is not a Lexus sedan either this thing is not much of a use . I am switching back to on the ear hands free .
5 #### Have 3 of these , and they do a great job ! ! ! Never have to worry when I need my boat or generator ! ! ! !
4 #### I also have another full featured GPS that does everything . So why did I buy the Nuvi 200 ? Because its easy to use and does n't require I re - read the manual each time I want to use it . The lack of bluetooth , text - to - speech , mpg , etc . just get in the way to what a GPS unit main function is . The lack of the congested traffic receiver option does n't worry me . It wo n't help if you do n't live in a major metro city or are unwilling to pay the extra subscription fee . The only negative comment is that Garmin offers several extras ( i.e. downloadable extra car icons , POI mgr , etc . ) but do n't tell you about them on the website or the manual , so need to Google the web to find out how to download them on their website .
4 #### Amazing power from such a tiny battery . Cranks way better than my previous deep - cycle battery . We 'll see how it lasts over the course of a few years , but so far I am very optimistic . Installed in a 1966 Porsche 911 .
5 #### I 've crammed this thing with nearly all my gear except for lighting grip stuff and I think I still have room for a 55 - 300 .
5 #### I bought this 3 months back , it just takes few secs to put on and take off .... I do n't use it daily or so , so ca nt say much about it leaving any marks on the fret board or the neck ... But this is perfect for those who use a capo occassionally , maybe also for frequent use ?
5 #### I am using this with our very high 4th grade students and they are loving the book . I found a resource online that is helping them analyze the characters / setting / themes / etc . and learn about foreshadowing and flashback . They are enjoying the story because it is n't just another WWII story about the Nazis . Instead , it is WWII when Japan invated Burma .
4 #### Purchased this for my wife to carry her D80 with two lenses . It 's a smaller pack , but more than enough for this equipment with room to spare for the sensor duster , a towel , and a flash . Ideal for ladies with a DSLR camera and up to three lenses . Light , sturdy , and good interior padding for the equipment .
4 #### I really like this little light . I also got the American DJ Pinspot hard gel color caps , they really add a nice touch . The body does get a little hot while it is working but for the amount of light it is producing that is to be expected .
5 #### Good for short jobs , like connecting my nearby printer to my network switch , which is itself connected by a very long ethernet cable to the router down the hall in another room . Go go Belkin !
4 #### The item works as advertised . I had to purchase this to use as a relay to trigger the parking lights from a bulldog keyless entry system . Nothing fancy about the part . It works as advertised .
3 #### Strong and well made item for the money . I had to use 2 flat washers ( each 3/32 " thick ) to enable me to use it on my 2005 Jeep Liberty as the Jeep center cap on the spare wheel prevented the outer casing of the lock from inserting all the way down so that the key could be turned . No big deal , still a good buy !
5 #### This product is so great that I needed to purchase a second one . I use one of these to set my phone on my nightstand . I thought that it was such a great product that I had to order a second one ! I wish that the magnets set off the dock mode in my Thunderbolt .
4 #### If you need to hide only one wire , this cordmate is for you . But if you have several wires to run , you should look at something with more room because you will simply not be able to run multiple wires in this kit . I hope this helps you with your purchase ! God Bless , Joe
5 #### This book was free . And I am so glad it was because otherwise I would not have read it . Love this series . Sweet romance , good story , a little intrigue some drama but a happy ending .
5 #### If you have a rig with a standard plastic dash these are great . I 'm kind of a neat freak when it comes to my cars and I hate when people use spray stuff to clean their dash / interior . It just makes the sun glare in your eyes due to the shininess . These dusters let you clean the dust leaving a brand new looking surface without the use of sprays or cleaners . It 's generally not dirty , it 's just dusty . Just sayin
5 #### Make sure they come with the safety pins ! I purchased 2 pairs , but one pair was the older model which did not have the pin you see on the pictures !
5 #### I purchased this pick holder and the Dunlop flat pick holder . I prefer this one ; the picks slide out smoothly , caompared to the flat one which has a higher tension but is n't as fluid .
5 #### The Dunlop Fin is like getting a 12 string guitar for the price of a pick . The scalloped edge , when strummed across a chord , produces a chiming , shimmery effect that adds a lot of depth and sparkle to the chord . Sounds gimmicky , right ? It 's not . I do n't know how it works , but it does . It also makes for pretty effortless pick scrapes , if you 're into those . They also hold their shape better than most picks , but then I only use the green and purple ones , which are quite thick . The sharper , horn - like point also makes tremolo picking a lot easier . Lastly , you have a standard , rounded blunt pick end for your normal playing . The somewhat textured surface makes them stick to your fingers better than a plastic pick , especially when sweaty . It also makes it easier to rotate the pick in your hand to access the various edges of the pick . All in all , I do n't know why anyone would use a regular triangular pick when these are larger , sturdier , and provide such interesting tones when you want them to . Try them !
5 #### These headphones have been an industry standard for a very long time , and for good reason . They have a very balanced , clean and clear sound . They will deliver whatever they are fed with little coloration . Compared to my Audio Technica ATH - M50s , these do n't have the bump in the bass that makes the Audio Technicas sound full , but the upper frequencies and voices are more detailed and sweeter on the Sonys . The Sonys are capable of very deep bass , but if you want more than is present in the recording , you 'll have to EQ it in . I use mine with a FiiO A3 amp with the bass boost on , and the sound is spectacular .
5 #### I 've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium / light set and I was not disappointed . There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging . They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings . I 've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to . Would recommend to any level of guitar player !
5 #### Fast shipping ! This works well to dry my car streak free !
4 #### I installed this to operate Head Lights for a subcompact Tractor . Good construction for outdoor environment .. Good current rating . Good value for the money .
4 #### good value , on time shipment . no complaints . thanks here are 12 more words to fill up the space as requested
5 #### This drop clutch is just fantastic .. I have used them for years and always buy the same model . Nothing on the market works as well as this . Simple installation , and it allows you to use your double bass pedals or double kick with a closed hi hat all from tapping it with your drumstick .. It could n't be easier .. Best Buy on the Market .
4 #### Best damn plectrums in the world . I used to use the thick ass purple ones , these , I like better .
5 #### great buy very thankful just in time for my meeting
5 #### Great sound , great feel when plugging and unplugging ... no sense that these will ever wear out .
4 #### Excellent speaker phone . Pairing with a Razr was a snap , and I 've had no issues with the level of volume that some others have complained about . And best of all , you do n't have to walk around looking like a dork with one of those goofy earpieces hanging off the side of your head . The one negative is that the Jabra , like many other Bluetooth speaker phones , does n't come with a wall charger , only one for the car , which I find inconvenient and clunky . I solved that problem by purchasing a PowerLine 12 - volt DC - AC Power Socket right here at Amazon for $ 11.08 . It performs very well . Though I wish there were a wall charger included with the Jabra , it was n't a deal - breaker for me . For the money , this speaker phone has met all my expectations .
5 #### Just as described , great disposable cameras for our trucking fleet .
5 #### I bought this for a 3GS on sale now that manufacturers are discontinuing this form factor . It 's a lovely and slender case . it has some open areas at top and bottom , so it 's not Otter - box level protection , but it 's also not Otter - box level bulk . Recommended .
5 #### I love to use these on my guitar strap . I can use one strap on several guitars .
2 #### These were not fresh strings . They really lacked the good tone you expect from new Elixir strings . The price was good and delivery was quick
5 #### Worked very well on my 10 year old K&N filter , it is good as new now
5 #### Best K&N air filter cleaner I ever bought . Cleans the filter really really great .
5 #### I just recieved my set Altec Lansing ACS 48 's after about three days . I just have to say first off that these speakers are totally worth the money . Before I bought these speakers , I used a pair of 30 dollar no name speakers . I truly did not think that there would be that much of a difference , but it has become quite obvious that there definitely is . This unit provides so much bass that my room shakes with each thump . Also , the mid and high range is excellence , since I hear things in songs I never heard before . By the way , the technical information provided by Amazon is erroneous . The sub has 40 watts of power , and each satellite has 20 watts , totaling to 80 watts of pure power . If you have the extra money , you just have to buy these speakers . The only bad thing is that there is no treble control , and the bass control is on the back of the sub , which may be inconvenient for you . Oh yeah , and the subwoofer is quite large , so make sure you have enough room first .
4 #### If you do not want an uncomfortable bluetooth receiver in your ear this is the way to go . It 's definitely loud enough and the best part is that the voice recognition works like a charm .
3 #### I wish the legend around the knobs was back lit but it is a functional no frill CB . It 's all l need for 4 wheeling .
4 #### Cheap products but worth the money . The only comments it 's regarded to the flexible silicone since does not fit very well on the phone , everything else just fine .
5 #### Super small , but can act as a suitcase as well . Really happy with this purchase . Looks like it will hold up for years . The laptop sleeve is super helpful . Through TSA with no issues . Love it !
5 #### A must have for all guitar players . Buy several ... they're a great deal .
5 #### Great construction and easy to use ! Should last a very long time !
4 #### This screen savers are great they keep all of the makeup & etc off the actual phone
3 #### Only certain cartridges fit in this case , other than that it 's a sturdy case .
4 #### Love this thing very easy hook up to Dual Car stereo . Spend 5 hours on my road trips a few times a month voice is clear reception has been very good so far . A must have to make auto handsfree when on the phone . I 'd have to say clear as my Onstar in my Chevy truck .
5 #### This item works just fine on my Verizon HTC Thunderbolt . My only issue is that the AC charger only has 1 ft of wire from the wall wart to the connector .
5 #### I bought a 10 year old boat with pristine upholstery and this was claimed to be how that was possible . I have been using it since and the upholstery does stay clean . I 'll update this in another 10 years and let you know how the vinyl is holding up ...... Do not apply to walkway areas !
4 #### The range is not amazing but it works good and covers the garage door entrance just fine . Easy to install . Wires are not twisted together and in the way like on older motion lights .
4 #### A wonderful camera for Intrnet use . For auctions , emails , web sites , Etc . this is a fine camera . The advantages are great macros ( down to 1"),10X zoom lens , comes with rechagable battery and charger , simple downloading of floppies to your PC and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium . However this is NOT a camera suitable for Photos ( Because of the 640X480 resolution ) Do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos . For fine photos go to a 1 or 2 megapixel cameras . I also own the Nikon Coolpix 950 camera and recommend any Nikon or Olympus camera . Only the Nikons have great Macro capability ( If this is important ) A great buy for the money is the Olympus 460/490 .
4 #### First let me say if you are used to an installed satellite system , you may be a little disappointed with the size of the screen . There is no getting around the fact that this screen seems tiny compared to factory installed systems . However , the small size helps to make it very portable , and easy to fit in a shirt pocket or even mount on your bike ( which is what I plan to do using the optional handlebar mount . ) So far the maps and directions have been spot on for me . This is an excellent entry - level system and a great portable GPS .
1 #### These are terrible . They do n't dispense as they should and they left horrible streaks all over my screen . Were you even trying ? Who signed off on this product ? Amazon should not sell these .
5 #### Replaced old strip with this one . Really like it and color coding of outlets . Great service .
1 #### I have compared this Yamaha recorder to an Adler wooden soprano recorder . There are many differences between the two instruments . First of all the Adler recorder has a richer softer more mellow tone compared to the louder more piercing tone of this instrument . The two instruments are also made in separate countries . The Adler is made in Germany , whereas the Yamaha is made in China . The two instruments are also encased differently . The Adler comes in a blue and white Velcro case . The Yamaha comes in a cheap plastic case with a hard to close snap . Both of these instruments have Baroque fingering . For the most part , they both play each note in tune , except for one . The F note on the Yamaha recorder is actually F sharp . Not so on the Adler . If you have a recorder student in your household who is learning to play the instrument for the first time , this recorder is fine for that . As he or she grows up and advances in music , consider buying an Adler soprano recorder . Recorder teachers should also be aware of the differences between these two instruments .
2 #### I ordered this product about two months ago . I ordered two of them : one for my iPad and one for my iPhone . I thought the idea of having a longer cord would be amazing . But it 's not . You really get what you pay for . For some reason , my Apple products charge extremely slow with these cords . Also , the end input wires at the USB and charger part are broke and the wire is now exposed . I am not rough with these products at all . I sit them on the table , charge them , then take them off the charger . There is no reason that the wiring should be exposed . I recommend Belkin if you want quality .
5 #### The quality is great . Old product but never out of date .
4 #### Decent replacement for my preferred tri - corner abalone pick . Heavy weight allows you to vary tone by how hard you work it giving you volume when you need it . The shape gives you good purchase & you can play with any point - very handy if you have a tendency to let your pick rotate when you play .
5 #### Great bright white light . I 'm using them for my rear turn signals in my 2010 civic coupe . They were difficult to squeeze in due to the bottom being larger than the factory ones but they fit o.k . and I really like the white color light , the blue tint when they are not on , and their brightness .
3 #### The unit worked fine with cold oil . I could not start the boat engine to warm up the oil so it took a few hours to remove 5qts if oil , This fall I will use it with heated oil and I am sure it will be much easier .
1 #### The sound is so horrible when I connect my phone to it . Very POOR sound quality . To me , it only worths 25 cents .
5 #### I replaced a set of strings that were very used with these Martins . They are , as named , very light . They are easy on my fingers and give great tone . Quality company , great strings , great price !
5 #### The stock horn on my Suzuki Marauder quit - took a little bit to install this one - looks nice , fairly loud -
5 #### These are handy for a quick dusting of vehicle interiors , this is my second purchase .
4 #### I put these in the headstock area under the planet waves humidifier bag . Extends the life of it for a fraction of the cost . I live in the desert . Its dry here .
5 #### I 'm using this cable to connect an Epson WorkForce 633 to a 2009 Mac Mini and it does the job very well . If anything it is a bit too long so I have part of it rolled up but it works great . I have n't had a problem with it yet and I have had this for years now .
5 #### Good quality product . Looks great and does what is advertised .
3 #### Because this lens does not have the image stabilization I just did n't enjoy using it unless it was on a tripod .
1 #### I ordered two and I got charged for 2 and I only received one . I have not used it because I still need to buy another one .
2 #### I know they were only $ 13 , but they are poor quality . It 's very hard to get a clear picture with both eyes open . Put the $ 13 towards a better set of binoculars and do n't bother with these .
5 #### Just what I expected it to be . Will buy again if the opportunity arrives again that I will need it .
5 #### I was n't expecting much out of these because of mixed reviews . I am not into new and technical stuff . But I have a tv / dvd player that really needs help when it comes to the speakers . I can hear fine , but spouse is losing some hearing . Anyway I got this mainly for the portable tv / dvd player that I really like ( RCA)- for the travel trailer . So that 's what I tried it with first . COMPLETE AND AWESOME change to the sound . Tried it on my ipod next . AWESOME . The sound is so much better and richer on both devices . Tried it on a portable radio , OOPS , all static . with it plugged in , without- radio is fine ... not designed for that older type radio I guess . I ca n't speak to the durability because I have n't had it long . After I used it , I packaged it back up what it came in , instead of just the little carrying bag that comes with it . The whole package is small , and adds extra protection . But for us , it wo n't be used daily , etc . I think it 's well worth the money I spent .
1 #### Setup of the print server was straightforward , but it did n't work . I checked the company 's website , and this particular device is not listed as compatible with Windows 8 . Returned for a Win 8 compatible device .
5 #### easy to adjust and puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it . Used to have one of the ones that used threaded rod to unscrew to put the tension on and it took forever to get right and did n't seem to hold as well .
1 #### The Treo is more phone than function , but even as a phone , it has major bugs . Believe me when I tell you that this phone has added much stress to my life . I 've visited the Palm Knowledgebase and Support Forums many times to find out if I was alone , only to find many , many lost souls roaming those halls with so many " Treo Troubles " . To emphasize , the short list is - Dropped calls when a Call Waiting call is ignored . - Constant crashes . - Continuous rebooting required . - Malfunctioning features including the alarm , browser , voice commands and notes . - The non - expandable , 32 MB Program Memory limitation caused ( IMO ) much erratic behavior and system halts . The phone required rebooting , minimally , once per day . - Forget about multi - tasking . - Blue - tooth headset interaction required rebooting after every third call . - Visit Palms Support Forums and educate yourself before you buy this phone ! If you 're a PDA power user , you especially should steer clear of the Treo 700w if you wish to stay productive . It will not only hold you back , but it will aggravate you , break trains of thought , interrupt your workflow and make you wait in line at the Verizon store when you finally decide to abandon it and get something else . Been there , done that .
5 #### I use Dunlop Orange because the thickness is perfect . I hit the strings very , very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet I do n't break many strings .
5 #### I had to return this fuel filter because my truck had different size of fuel lines . The return was very easy .
5 #### Exactly as advertised , extremely satisfied . Had some issues with some cards that were corrupted , scandisk replaced immediately , great customer service .
3 #### Does n't open far enough for a older full size . Ratchet mechanism is a bit clunky . Its just OK
3 #### Had no complains , but this is not something I would buy again for a long term use , is just to used it for some time , then you get tired .
4 #### This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub . It works way better than the 7 - port DLink it replaced . The LED lights are a bit bright , but for me it 's not much of an issue since the hub lives down on the floor in my setup . I agree that it would be nice to be able to to turn them off though if it 's too bright , just cover over them with a strip of tape - problem solved . I am impressed with this hub and would recommend it . Note - it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures .
4 #### A little surprised that the metal gauge was a little lighter than I expected , however , it works just as advertised . On the flip side , the lighter weight makes it easy to maneuver . Overall , a great buy ! Recommend to all wanting good quality and a great price .
4 #### Item arrived fast . Works well in 04 Ford Focus with Pioneer Radio .
5 #### Very nice item . Seems to be well made . I bought a second one for my truck at work
5 #### This is a great case , it looks very close to Apple 's own bumper , but is much much cheaper . I 'm not saying the quality is the same , it 's not . If you look closely you will see slight differences in the actual quality of the plastic , it 's not 100 % as good as apples ... but it 's around 90 % as good in my opinion in terms of quality , and the price is really great since cases typically last for only 3 months or so in my experience before you feel like you need a new one due to wear and tear . I recommend this product . I bought it from xFish online FYI .
4 #### Works perfect for my Toyota Highlander . Keep everything from flying around or falling out . Buying something squishy ? or delicate that you want to keep from flying around in the back truck ? well this is the perfect product to keep it from flying around in the back trunk like a F5 tornado
4 #### I ordered this antenna only to realize that it is not for use with the zboost yx545 as it seems many people are ordering it for . The paper that comes with the yx545 even shows this antenna is for the yx500 model and is not dual band . It may work sort of for the yx545 but if you want to use the full dual band capability ... buy the correct antenna . Rating it 4 starts as the unit seemed constructed well but was missing the RG59 adapter that the parts list claimed it came with . The short cable on the antenna is male as is the 50 ' of cable that comes with the yx545 so I would have had to purchase that adapter additionally to even connect it .
5 #### I purchased these a few days ago . I read up on the power numbers and what they meant before I purchased them . I had read only one review that said the images jumped when viewed , and after I adjusted them , there was that issue , BUT I also read that this was due to the high powered - ness of them . I worked with them a bit and I weighed out the pros and cons about this . I wanted somethng powerful . I was not going to use them very often or for a prolonged period of time . Maybe for concerts , and just outside . So its ability to be more powerful over - rode the slight jumpiness . I am very happy with them .
5 #### Works great . Easy to attach the GPS and easy to memove it . Stays in place when set down on the dash . Highly recommended .
4 #### Great Product . Wish it came with longer screws . Easy fix just went and bought some longer ones . My les paul traditional which is pretty heavy stays on the wall no problem .
4 #### A good cable for the money . Could have better stress release , but certainly plenty good enough for normal use and a very good value .
4 #### The product looks good . Made in Taiwan and it 's blingy - chrome . The build quality is there , so lets hope it works .
5 #### The sound quality on this thing is just as good , if not better than advertised . I use a Blackberry 8830 and it is known for high amounts of background noise . When using this headset , virtually all background noise is eliminated . Best noise reduction headset on the market . Only complaint is that my headset disconnects from my phone about 5 times per day with no explanation . Does n't appear to be the phone causing the problem so I may be looking swap this out as defective and get a new one .
1 #### from day one it would not work on one of my power source but i thought that it was my car until i tried using it in my wife 's car . very dissappointed .
5 #### I 've tried a lot of capos but this is the best . Just the right amount of pressure and easy to adjust .
2 #### I purchased the BlackBerry Curve Leather Holster in late August 2011 . I was initially pleased , as it looks nice and the automatic off feature worked . However , within 60 days the leather strap cracked where it folds across the top of the leather and across the Blackberry . The seller offered to exchange it for another , but ( 1 ) that would leave me without a holster during the process , and ( 2 ) the cost of shipping it back would amount to a substantial percentage of the price . I have chosen instead to cover the crack with black electrical tape , while waiting for the genuine BlackBerry original replacement I ordered . I just noticed that the strap has now cracked in a second place , where the strap curves across the front edge of the BlackBerry and back down . I should also mention that the chrome Sprint logo fell off the strap very early on , which did not bother me . FYI , I wear the holster on my belt , on my right side . The only significant stress it gets might be when I fasten the auto seatbelt across it .
3 #### this works for all usb cords , great if your in the car for long periods of travel time . high recommend
5 #### I put this on my 2002 honda accord . Lacing it was a pain ... I had to do it twice because the thread that came in the package was too short . I bought some waxed cotton thread at Hobby Lobby and used that instead , much stronger and a better look . Now it looks and feels great . Great product especially for the price . A tip : To make stitching this a lot easier , pre stretch the holes by running something through them , and dull the points of the needles so they do n't make new holes . Give yourself about 6 - 7hours to get it stitched tight and right .
3 #### I like the 10 sets , and it may be my imagination but I still prefer DRs over D'Addario . I throw these on my frakenstrat and my hollowbody . for that heavy and/or jazz tone .
5 #### Direct replacement to old wore out strap . Made my own for a temporary basis , but this one works perfect . Very thin but strong , so should last many years .
3 #### ultrapower 1900 its ok if u plug into phone and just let it charge , it wo n't charge the phone if your using it .. besides that its good if you ai nt by a wall or car charger ..
5 #### This is one of the best video tapes I have ever used . I do n't want to use any other tape besides TDK tapes ! !
5 #### After purchasing and receiving the hubs two days later thanks to Amazon prime it was time to install them . I opened the box and followed the instructions along with greasing up all the contact surfaces ( no specified in the directions ) I had the hubs installed in a matter of 15 minutes only tool that you may not have is a T-20 torx driver ti install the supplied hardware with the Warn Hubs
5 #### When I first got them , I thought that they were going to be cheap , as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging , but it was ok , I was n't expecting much from them . The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material . They did not bend at all when I tried to ( and believe , me I tried ) . Pick wearing is virtually non - existent , and I utilize Alt - Picking a lot in my practices . I actually learned my first sweep shred ( D major ) with these picks within a day of getting them . I highly recommend for the shred guitarist . My only complaint , is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do ( becuase of the grip ) but i got used to it rather quickly . IMPORTANT ! ! ! You can get these in 24 packs at [ ... ] for only $ 10 ! ! ! Free shipping as well ! Sorry , Amazon , but that is just to good a deal to pass on ...
5 #### This is very easy to position and works very well . The mount is strong and secure . The flex portion seems durable .
5 #### I like the fact that it does not have to be removed , so it is easier to use . Worked well on my automobile interior . Cleaned and restored the original color .
4 #### Good phone , but the older ones sounded better . The quality of sound is n't on par with the original or the newer phones .
5 #### I love the machine . Its working right now but it wo n't be working for long . The pint container of fog fluid that came with it had been opened and was nearly empty . That 's very disappointing , preventing a perfect transaction . : o (
5 #### I loved this product was everything I expected and more . Definitely would buy again excellent and cheaply . Arrived in good condition and have no regrets
4 #### This product is easy to apply and easy to remove , however , it does not have the deep glossy wet look that I wanted . I feel that for the investment of $ 29.95 , there are other products that offer the look I was looking for . I give it a 4 star rating insted of a 5 .
5 #### this a very good mouth piece and is reasonably priced . I seen this priced at < $ 360.00 at a local music store .
5 #### Quick and easy to install . ( Ok , I did need to jack my Jeep up REALLY high and crawl under it . ) I can remove them quickly when I 'm not towing the trailer .
3 #### I was looking for a pair of sticks that I would have oin an emergency . Just in case that my preferred sticks broke and need sticks until replacements were purchased . these would be just to get me through a set . I was looking for sticks that were under $ 8.00 and so I was looking for anything high - quality , as these would n't be me first choice of drums sticks to play with . I had n't paid attention that these sticks were n't " NYLON " tipped , so the quality of the sticks was my mistake . these sticks , would be what I would recommend for beginners or what you 'd have at a music store for demo - ing drum sets .
5 #### It does what it suppose to do ! Fast shipping , what else should I ask for it ? This is the one to get !
2 #### I purchased the Rex after reading a number of excellent reviews , including many from people who had purchased the unit to " sync " with their Windows applications , particularly Outlook . I was disappointed to learn later that the Rex does not presently sync with Windows ME or its version of Outlook . Given the number of keystrokes required to enter even small items of info on Rex manually , the Rex is of little use to anyone with Windows ME . Xircom confirms the Rex does not presently sync with Windows ME , although they say they 're working on it .
4 #### According my test was not as loud I was hoping . Still a pretty loud horn .
5 #### This is a plug for three plugs . If I had a pug he 'd plug them too .
5 #### I plugged in my workgroup switch , and then plugged in my PS-3 , my Dell gaming computer , and my Dell laptop and everything worked just right . Hard to improve on this thing for trouble free installation and operation , and the previous reviews were what guided me to select it .
5 #### Works great if you follow the instructions . I bought a couple of these and they work great . It works great to quickly clean the dust and pollen from my dark colored motorcycle . I also have one I use for keeping the car dashboards clean .
5 #### Bought these to add to extra to the shop , I have a jeep and these are perfect for the lifted jeep , holds without me worrying about them falling off or breaking .
4 #### Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection . Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it .
2 #### I drive a work van around so it is very noisy and people have a hard time hearing me with this . Had to quit using it unless I am at home where it is quiet .
4 #### really great for the price too bad phone got wet shortly there after .
5 #### Bought one 4.5 years ago , tried others , buying another . Very comfortable , does n't muffle the most necessary high end frequencies . If only there was a comparable closed back version of this , i want to isolate elec . Drum tapping , these do n't prevent one from hearing them .
5 #### This steering wheel cover is made of good quality . The grip is great and it fits the steering wheel perfectly .
4 #### Very good quality reeds . No complaints . My daughter had no problem with them as she moved up to thicker reeds . Great price !
4 #### I 've had this bag for over a year and have no complaints about it 's features and quality . I travel a fair bit to a variety of environments and it 's always done a great job of protecting the gear from rain , snow , dust , heat , etc . However , I would highly recommend that you consider how you are going to use a gear bag before committing to a backpack style bag . For me , I thought it would be a lot more convenient and allow me to carry one bag ( as opposed to also carrying my shoulder briefcase ) when I traveled . That has n't been the case . There is very little additional room in this bag to carry anything other than photo gear . The other thing I overlooked was how I use my camera . With the backpack style bag , you need to stop , remove the bag from your back or shoulder , open it up , change lens , etc every time you make a change . And , btw , make sure you zipe it back up or you 're likely to have some of your gear fall out . For me , I 'm starting to look at more traditional gear bags to replace this one . However , if you do n't make gear changes that often , do n't carry other bags at the same time , or you already have a shoulder gear bag , this is a terrific bag and met every need I had at the time .
5 #### I 've tried a lot of sticks , but none I like as well as these for playing my electronic kit . They 're light and slender sticks , so probably not good for very heavy hitters , but they are very nice when it comes to playing mesh drum heads . They 're consistent and I find that I 'm more comfortable holding them , so I play better . The finish feels good , the color looks cool , and they 're surprisingly long lasting . Overall great sticks and well worth trying .
5 #### Very full and satisfying sound that can best be described as what you remember music sounding like from the 80 's and 90 's . Very easy to drive , but especially enjoyable with a good headphone amplifier . They come with the horrible 80 's design that occasionally snags your hair / skin from time to time when you 're adjusting them , but you get the hang of it and the sound more than makes up for it .
5 #### I have over 15 years playing experience and I would not have any other strings on my guitar . I have messed around with many different brands and even the $ 1 / pack I found online ( which I wanted to change half way through a set ) but there is simply nothing else out there at this price which lasts as long , sounds as good and makes playing such a pleasure as these . I play mostly acoustic guitar in a one man show and play anywhere from 2 - 5 hours , though the average is around 3 hours . I finger pick but mostly strum with medium thickness picks . I tune frequently to open chords and there never is a problem . I never leave home without a few packs in my case in case a string breaks , but I rarely need them until I decide to change all my strings . They last a long time and never seem to loose their vibrant sound .
5 #### These seem to be of very high quality and sounded great ! Clean cut but not low cut ,
4 #### it is a ok . it fit me good . I will call again in the near future . i am very glad
1 #### Unlike the Clymer KLR manual I reviewed earlier this one sucks . Bad organization , blurry photos , and convoluted text make this the absolute worst manual ever . I gave it to the new owner when I sold my Bonneville and his eyes lit up . It 's never been used I told him ... little did he know . Delivery from Amazon was quick and for a hard - bound book the price seemed fair . Still I 'd say do n't waste your money , look for something better .
5 #### I own several harmonicas but I love this one . I think my choice for Harmonicas will be Lee Oskar , because it sounds really good and they are easy to mantain .
5 #### Got this to handle the cords from my Bose Cinemate speakers . It takes one fine , but two is quite the squeeze . As others mentioned , it 's quite small in diameter . Takes a fair bit of effort to squeeze the cord in and then clasp it shut , but it works well . Super easy to hack through with a hack saw , sticks well to the wall . Pretty much everything I was looking for .
5 #### Perfect underwater camera ! Nice looking , too ! Ended up buying another and will likely buy many more in the future for inexpensive underwater needs .
2 #### This product will not work with any operating system past vista I found that out a little to late
3 #### Mic quality compared to the onboard mic of the actual radio is stunningly worse . Unit functions , but the audio picked up by it is so bad , compared the quality of the built in mic is apparent as night and day .
5 #### Worked great for replacing the broken ones I had on my 2500HD extended cab .
2 #### Looks good and fairly easy to install . Materiel is too thin and flexible . Time will tell how much protection it will provide from mud and rocks . Product dimensions are 19x11x0.25 ! ! ! ! If it was 0.5 " as listed it would be perfect ! Also length is 19 " not 20 " as listed . even 20 " would be short for a full size truck ( RAM 2500 ) . Hopefully it will be more than decoration until I can install something more permanent . Please fix dimensions on listing ! ! ! !
4 #### Bought on a recommendation to clean my boots . Product works great , but i 'm not sure its necessary . I feel some soapy water and a brush might have had the same effect , but the product works as intended . Did n't damage my boots and cleaned them up nicely . As precaution always do a spot treatment before using on your shoes .
5 #### Very nice guitar for the price . Worth every penny . Action is great . The pickups are sweet for stock pickups . I would definitely buy again and probably will in a different color .
3 #### its a red strap , matches my 6 string , did have it fall off once but that s more the end of my nut on the guitar then this strap
4 #### When I put the card in my Galaxy Player 4.2 , it showed up with an error but after formatting the card worked OK . It comes up with 59.46 , so you lose a few GB . Also , it is rather slow so it does n't seem to be working at full speed . Still , it 's really nice to have all that space !
5 #### I 've been using the Meguiar 's 8 - inch pads on my Porter Cable variable speed buffer for years . My last one has been used to buff my Subaru Outback , 4 - Door Dodge truck , and Motorcycle and still has plenty of life left .
5 #### I have AT&T for my phone service but in my home I get either no signal to maybe one bar . AT&T wanted to charge me a monthly fee for a similar product that MAY work . I purchased this product and now have five bars with no problems at all ! Definitely buy this before thinking about other products . You will definitely be satisfied !
5 #### It does exactly what it 's supposed to do . No more . No less
5 #### It has a flat cable that saved my day ! my car has very tight cable space so after a little research I found this and it works perfect !
5 #### I just plain love these picks . I just ca n't imagine playing bass or mandolin with anything else . They feel nice and comfortable in the hand thanks to the indent for the thumb . They give a nice , driving , punchy sound with my Thunderbird bass and on mandolin they 're great , especially for tremolo picking . They feel big and hefty but comfortable and controllable at the same time . The only downside is they do n't work quite as well if you 're playing the guitar . These picks are just a bit too big for guitar strings in my experience . Some people may be able to make these picks work for guitar , but this is n't really what these picks excel at . If you 're a bass or mandolin player give these picks a shot . I did , and I fell in love with them .
5 #### I bought this to cover some areas that the original dynomatt buy did nt , and it performed much greater than i had ever expected it too .
5 #### I ve had my Rio 500 for 3weeks and I love it . Save your money on buying better head phones because the ones that come with it are very clear and good . It is quick to erase the memory and almost as quick to put music on . The only thing I do n't like is you have to use the battery power to put music on the Rio 500 but its so fast with USB hookup that it dosent use much battery power . There also built strong . I go to the Gym and I was on the Treadmill and it fell out of my pocket hit the mat then shot off the back and on to the floor , when I picked it up it was still going . It also hays extra setting in the menu that is good . I think you should get one , alittle $ $ $ but very good product . Also I would like to say I am pleased with Amazon , fast delivery and super service , thanks Amazon ...
5 #### Fantastic product . Cuts and installs easily . I used it to shield a cord from a baby 's monitor to keep prying fingers out . Added benefit is that it looks good too . It 's paintable , but we just left it white and ran it near the window molding , and out across to the outlet . Great value .
5 #### Very good headphones for the price . Use them all of the time and believe we have already got our money 's worth .
5 #### It works exactly as advertised . This is the 2nd one I have purchased . The last one was locally bought and lasted me 6 years . Only needed to be replaced because I got it dirty .
5 #### Does what it is supposed to do , great little extendomatic for trailers that are n't yours .
3 #### Unlike other velcro sleeves , these do not have the option of attaching to the cable , which makes it inconvenient if you want to use it in a situation where you want to take it off and on frequently .
4 #### It holds our TV up . That 's we asked of it . Not difficult to install at all
5 #### I used to have the radio - shack - branded edition of these ( Optimus PRO-45 ) which were stolen years ago . I nor work as a night stocker , and needed a new set of portables , and I 'm happy to say they have n't changed . Super light , fold up nice and compact . They come with a pretty nice " leather " bag , though I just keep them in a small pouch inside my backpack . They also come with a nice heavy , solid feeling 1/4 " adapter if for some reason you like to plug in your portable headphones to an amplifier . Solid bass all the way to the bottom . Sound better than Beets solo for sure .
5 #### I 've had these cables over 2 years now and they are all still working great . I use them when I want to change my pedal board around but do n't feel like making my solderless cables . I would actually trust these over my George L 's because sometimes those cut out and I have to redo the ends .
5 #### Phone looks and feels great . I get excellent battery life . The only issue is the lousy Verizon software . Buy this same phone from T - Mobile , Sprint , or Cingular .
5 #### Love this item . Please do n't force your customers to write more than they want just to fill a word quota . It is very annoying .
5 #### I got this for my LG 800 g phone , and right when i put it in , the phone automatically recognized it . The adapter it comes with also makes it easy to plug into a computer and transfer files to the phone . All in all , i definitely recommend this product , it does exactly what it says , and for the price , its a win - win situation
4 #### We have stuck with Incipio through ( 2 ) iPod touches and another iPhone and like the quality and feel of their products . This is no exception . The cutouts are precisely placed and the combination of silicone and the hard shell provides good protection . Will keep buying their products in the future .
1 #### I tried the S9 because of the reviews . A mistake ! ! ! The fit , wrapping around the back of the neck and pulling on the ears , drives me crazy . I used the S9 only for iMac computer . Had a terrible time pairing . But the tight grabbing at the neck fit was totally un acceptable . Exchanged for the Jabra Halo BT650s set and have loved the Jabra Halo 100 % .
5 #### Works flawlessly on my Honda B16A motor . Keeps the crank pulley from turning so you can reach 130 lbs / ft of torque on that pulley bolt .
5 #### This cover fits my Yahama YPG-235 perfectly . It seems durable like it will last a long time . Easy to put on and take off . Very happy with this purchase .
5 #### The product is very nice as described , and i am very happy with the purchase . recommend this to anyone who is looking for sword holder .
5 #### Great stand ! I love it . Perfect for my needs . After reading several reviews on this , I must say that I have NO issue with it at all . Many claimed there was a portion of the stand that breaks easily , but , I have no issues at all . I highly recommend it to any bassist . As a plus , it actually holds my baritone ukulele as well . Had to lower it as much as possible but , it worked . Get this stand - you wo n't regret it !
4 #### Have to say for the money this is not crap . I put it on my 08 Saturn Vue and seen I was a half of an inch off on one side . Side to side is even , but forward to back on one side I 'm off . I tried to pull it up on one side to fix it , yeah not happening . Its on and on good . I had to put 3 half inch notches in the tape for water to drain . The slope torts the windshield might be a problem for water to pool . After I put it on , I drove around and it helped with a lot of the wind noise . Do n't sound like a helicopter in my Vue that much with the sunroof open . When I Fatmat the roof should take care of the rest of the noise . The only thing I am worried about is the water pooling when it rains .
5 #### Makes changing strings SO much easier ! Should be in every guitarists accessories
5 #### This cargo bar is very handy ! I do n't know how many times I have had things roll to the front of the front of the bed and have to fish after it under my bed cover . It 's really sturdy and very simple to use . Worth every penny !
5 #### This stuff is great . Really brings new life back to old molding on vehicles . Last for several weeks .
5 #### Both the USB and round outlets are well powered . Overall fit and finish of high quality ; appropriate for a new car . cord between male power plug and the unit so you can locale them two different places in your car ; nice .
5 #### Paid much more at a national boating supply chain but very happy with the results . My 2004 27 - foot Cruiser has black side panels . I 've never been able to remove all the oxidation until now . I used a double sided wool buffing pad and a variable speed rotary buffer . I wiped a fair amount of compound onto a 2 ' x 2 ' area with a hand applicator , then machine buffed at no more than 2000 rpm using medium pressure . After a few swipes back and forth , up and down , the compound started breaking down . I then upped the buffer speed to 4000 rpm and lightly swiped back and forth until most of the compound turned to dust . Toweled off , it left a brilliant shine and mirror finish . I finished up with Collinite Fleet Wax . For the first time since acquiring it in 2010 , my boat looked like brand new .
5 #### My son wanted these for Christmas so I got them for him . He was very pleased with them along with the other kind I bought for him . He said they worked fine .
5 #### Still love the Porta Pros , which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound . Koss really nailed it with the Porta Pros , which are much more valued in Europe , I found out from a friend . Excellent warm sound , a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience , not at all .
4 #### bestop has always been good quality merchandise.this product is no exception.very good quality fit and well constructed.make sure you know your tire size so you get the right fitment .
5 #### Works quite well for playing my iTunes computer , iPod , and iPhone through my stereo system
1 #### Not satisfied with the quality of the product I purchased . Did n't see any difference in reception of the antennae on my cell phone
4 #### It is growing on me ... You have to hit it hard to get it to respond so when I go to it I am not nice to it .... But it really responds then .
1 #### I have an old set of Kenwood radios with external speaker mics , but they are getting old . So I bought a pair of motorola GMRS radios and these external speaker mics . I must say , they feel really well built . They are solid , with a good clip . There is just one problem . They suck . Talking and listening through these things is like talking and listening through a pillow . It was such a disappointment . I had to ask my friends to keep repeating themselves . Now I have to shop all over again . Do n't get these . Oh , and I should add that it 's not the radios . They sound good until you plug these mics in .
5 #### Works exactluy as discribed , would order again if I ever need to replace . great quality whish I had seen earlier will definitely order more
5 #### I absolutely love these screen protectors I drop my phone all the time and never has my screen shattered and I also love the mirror effect great price very fast shipping ! ! ! !
5 #### I opted for the environmentally friendly version of the service kit , and like it quite a bit . I feel like I can get a more precise application onto my filter and waste less product . I hardly use any , and get a very good application each time I use it .
5 #### works great , have used this product for several years on my boat upholstery
5 #### helped just enough when i was in the middle of B.F.E.
5 #### These work Great , I love them , I watch wildlife and spot targets shooting and on occasion use them to get the tag number of speeders own my street
5 #### Netgear provides an excellent , durable , professional network switch . And Amazon offers it at an UNBEATABLE low price ! Excellent . This router works fine with all of the hardware including a Brother Laser Printer , an Apple iMac , and a Windows Desktop Machine . This switch will give you your best bang for your buck , guaranteed !
4 #### I have a Yamaha f200 and after 5 years I had a small leak from one of the steering seals . got a quote for well over $ 200 to have the shop fix This and I saved $ $ $ buying this kit . I 'm no boat mechanic but this was very easy to get on . I went ahead and replaced both sides . The tool is the best part otherwise good luck getting these caps off . I have 4 stars for I feel it 's a little pricy for what it is .
5 #### I was surprised at how much of a difference this really made on my filter . Last year was when I decided to switch over to k&n in my car and motorcycle so I have n't had to clean them before . Took the dirt and debris right out and brought the color right back to it .
5 #### I have ordered several of these - like 6 or 7 . I love them . They are great for holding picks & make wonderful gifts .
1 #### This HDMI cable is VERY low quality and not reliable . After receiving this cable , i used it to connect my DSLR to a TV and noticed instantly the artifacts in the image caused by the cable . Colour was messed up and the image was flickering . The next time i tested it , it did not work at all . My other name - brand HDMI cables do not have any issues . The seller gave me a refund , but still , save you time and buy one from a known brand .
3 #### The strings that came with my Martin 000 - 15 M sounded bright & clear . I liked the sound . But just for the heck of it , I decided to try these Polywebs . After about 10 minutes of playing , I realized that these strings were not meant for the guitar that I put them on . I noticed that these strings were not as bright and they did n't have that nice " ringing " tone that the original strings provided . My Martin sounded lifeless . I then installed a set of Ernie Ball 2150 Earthwood Phosphor Bronze strings . The brightness and the fun is back . I know that Elixer makes great strings . They sound great on my electrics . But , these Polywebs just did n't work out on my particular acoustic guitar . Keep in mind that my rating is for the Polywebs as they sound on my particular guitar . Your results may vary . Next time , I might try the Elixer Nanowebs which are supposed to sound brighter .
4 #### Was a little doubtfull if it would fit the iPhone 4 with Otter Defender , but worked out fine . A little too big but not to bother about . Quality OK , has been on my belt now for a month . Had another one that only lasted a week !
5 #### I 've been using these for 30 years , they stay in tune and rarely break . I do however change them after every 3rd show . Corrosion resistance could be better , for guitars that do n't get used much . These are great strings for beginners to professionals . I 've tried the cryogenic strings to nickel plated and for my style of playing the others cost more and get changed just as often .
5 #### Great addition to my pedal board ! Running my 2012 Fender American Standard Telecaster through this , and on to my ' 65 RI Princeton Reverb amp . These all sound great together . I find I leave it on almost all the time now .
3 #### Fits perfect and does its job at protecting the phone . However these otterboxs need replacing every few months because the outer rubber skin gets worn our and stops fitting right . Also the screen protector gets scratched up . Dirt collects inside the case also so it has to be taken apart and cleaned occasionally , which is n't always an easy task . One more thing . This case is Pink and Purple . Not red and blue like it kind of looks like in the picture . I 'm a 30 year old man walking around with a pink and purple phone ....
5 #### So I 'm new to the world of CB radios but this CB is so simple , I did n't need much instruction on how to use it . It 's cheap too . I had it installed in my truck in less than an hour , and the first half of that was deciding where to put it lol . I also get great reception from a fairly long distance , but that might be the whips too . I 'm not sure . But anyways , If your looking for a quality , cheap CB this is the one .
5 #### Great Value . I get it before taking air flight . I wanted to have over ear headphone which has bigger driver as I care sound quality than brand . This Panasonic RP - HT21 did great job as I expected . Sound is clear with powerful bass . It is ultra light and compact which fits my purpose of traveling . I ca nt believe this is less than $ 10 ... I can recommend this headphone to any of my friends .
2 #### For my camera , a Nikon D3300 , the set up just does n't work . From focusing to using the camera in manual mode , it was just too much work to get a great shot .
1 #### Snake oil ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this junk reminds me of the old time veterinarians putting " crystals " on a horse hoof that was bad . After lighting the crystals with a match the smoke would billow for about a minute making the owner think that this was some great stuff . This junk just produces smoke and my truck still runs crappy . I got my money back . PS : do n't use STP either this crap just settles in the oil pan like mat of gooey oil .
4 #### I liked the acoustic Elixirs , but the electric strings were not as bright as I like . I know it says you loose some of that because of the coating , but I thought it was too much . I may try the Nanowebs on the electric to see if they 're brighter than the Polywebs . I really do n't feel a lot of difference in the way they feel . P.S. I got about 6 months out of them and went back to the Ernie Balls . I ca n't say they 're worth 3 times the price of Ernie Balls .
5 #### K and n is a great product . Plenty for multiple uses .
4 #### This fit just fine . This is not a soft silicone so it is a bit slippery but better than no case . Great price too !
5 #### I was in a pinch , as I un - assembled the wheel and was all ready to install a new bearing when I discovered my 1 " bearings were not the right size . Went to a couple of stores only to find that all that anyone carried was the 1 " bearings . So I ordered these and they arrived on - time and fit perfectly . As one other reviewer noted , they do not come pre - greased , but honestly I have never bought a set that was pre - greased . Otherwise , they installed fine and seem to be working good . I did finally put a proper bearing buddy on , so these bearings will hopefully last a few years . Will be ordering 2 more for the other wheel and a spare .
5 #### Great , works as intended on my Gopro hero4 . I recommend grabbing a couple of these
4 #### Installion and tools were great . I am pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend to purchase . I have sold my iPhone since buts its still working fine .
5 #### I 've played guitar for over fifty years and the Shubb Capo is easily the best capo I 've ever used . It 's low profile , tough , easily set up and removed , and perhaps best of all it 's customer repairable . I have one for each of my guitars .
5 #### I just picked up one of these so the next time I go to a convention and use my ! @#$% smart phone all day I wo n't find myself getting a low battery alert . Right now I 've got my Bold plugged in to this toy , running a frakking movie and running Bluetooth and the thing is still charging the battery ! The dingus comes with a plethora of adapters for different devices . As long as what you have can take power from a USB port ( that 's +5 VDC to the uninitiated ) , this baby can power it . Worth $ 40 ! BTW , I have now tried this on my Blackberry Playbook tablet and it WILL charge it !
5 #### Good size bag ! Holds my Canon Rebel , lenses , charger , wires , SD cards , and there is still plenty of room for more . Highly recommend !
5 #### I have lots of Belkin cables , and they have never failed me . The screw down mechanism is well designed , and does not allow the screw to back out ( and thus become MIA ) . Also , because the screw downs are rubberized , they are easier to grip and tighten . I have bought one set of the expensive gold - plated contact cables , but the added cost added nothing to performance .
1 #### This clip does not work with the vents on my car ( a 2006 for freestyle ) and is too top - heavy to work properly when my phone is nested in it . The rotating socket ball head shifts and tilts whenever I try to drive any appreciable distance . Would not recommend . Since I mainly ordered this product to get he included iphone cord that I needed as a replacement , I did not return the item . I do give the seller credit for quick shipping .
5 #### These are perfect for a professional headphone set that you can easily fold up and travel with . While not quite as good as something like the AKG studio phones , or open - ear phones , these are a fantastic value and come with great sound quality .
5 #### nice thick pick , almost feels boutique , I use these in pair with gravity picks , great for bass , and guitar . they do wear out after a couple weeks though
5 #### This product works like it should , what more can I say ? It arrived , took it out of the package , put it on the polisher and it worked .
5 #### The reason I chose this power supply adapter is that if you experiment with other simmilar power adapters you may end up either damaging your gadget(s ) or having undesired results . In my case , I had tried simmilar power adapters with my rp-50 unit , but many of these would get some kind of annoying noise through the circuits . So far I have had no problems whatsoever , the sound coming out of my unit is clean because this is the recommended power supply ; recommended amperage and volts .
3 #### I had a pair of these in the 90s which had a stellar build , excellent audio quality , and lasted for years and years with hard use . I purchased this pair in 2014 . The audio quality is good . Unfortunately , the build quality is not great . I 've given this pair moderate use , and the black ear cup lining is falling off -- exposing loose foam that wo n't last .
5 #### martin guitar strings for my acoustic guitars are the best in my opinion . they seem to last and sound great
4 #### If you are thinking of purchasing a Bluetooth speakerphone for use in your vehicle , you should consider getting this device from Motorola . This device is easy to use and makes use of what is now the standard power connection that is used by most mobile handset manufacturers . In other words , you do n't have to carry around many different car chargers for different devices . Also , you can use your cell phone 's charger to charge this device at home and do n't have to deal with charging the device while driving . In addition , this device has a pretty long battery life , which allows you to talk for many hours in between charges . This device also allows you to pair two phones . To me , the more important use for this feature is that I can drive my wife 's car and use this device as a Bluetooth speakerphone without having to deal with setting up anything . An alternative use for being able to pair two phones is that you can have both phones paired simultaneously and both can use the speakerphone when taking or making calls while in the car . I 'm not sure whether the one not driving will benefit much from this , but it 's one feature worth noting .
5 #### These picks are a great alternative for mandolin players that do n't want to spend mega - bucks on some of the other big name picks . They are also quite nice for guitar if you like a stiffer pick .
4 #### This router is excellent . Ease of setup and plenty of configurable options , make this an excellent buy . Make sure that the Firmware is upto date and some configuration is required for specialist reasons . But for true Plug & Play ( not pray ) this ca n't be beat ! ! !
1 #### It just randomly pops off my bass , it 's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down . I hate it .
5 #### using this for a galaxy s3 with a body glove case and it fits in this perfectly . pretty rugged case .
3 #### It was an okay screen protector but the image was darken a bit with this item . The texture not as smooth but it responded well with the screen when typing or selecting apps on the phone .
4 #### This is exactly what you think . It is very light and is perfect to listen to an announcer while sitting at a game . I use it in DC for Redskin games and it picks up channels well , although I do need to have the antenna fully extended .
5 #### Replaced original grab bars & look great on my truck !
5 #### Have always used the regular California Duster . Time to replace the one I have had for years . Thought I would try the Extra Large duster . This has twice the dusting surface , it is faster and does the same great job . I have a black Town and Country which shows dust ! This does a great job in just a few minutes . A great product .
4 #### Great to keep handy when you want to watch a bird in the back yard or in your purse when traveling . The magnification is adequate although not tremendous , a trade off for the convenient size .
5 #### I loved this Otterbox and hated that the Otterbox cases for the newere phones are not near as sturdy and well built . My husband even slammed the car hood on this ( it was sitting under the windshield ) and drove around with it there for a while and the phone was intact . It did have a slight crack in the screen but that was easily fixed . The phone survived and this was before Apple offered insurance for the iphone .
5 #### This is just what you 'd expect - a perfect fit replacement for a label maker . Text comes out sharp and it does n't jam .
5 #### Stays in place firmly . Moving is somewhat difficult , but I feel safe with it being clipped on . Intonation on all guitars I 've played it with is pretty good still .
5 #### works fine I am glad I ordered , or would have lost some critical data , and many photo 's that are very dear to me . Thank You
5 #### Super cute ! Two pieces ! Provides minimal protection like any other snap on . But this one is so cute , would look best on a black iPhone .
4 #### Affordable and easy to use for more connections to my router . Does the job .
5 #### I used to play Vic Firth 's Rock sticks with wood tips because I have long fingers and large hands . I prefer a longer stick with a bit more girth than the average 5B. I tried this sticks at a music store and actually purchased a brick of them ( 12 pairs ) . They seem to have almost been made for my hands . Everything from the finish , the short taper of the shoulder , and even the barrel tip . As stated on Vic Firth 's website , these sticks are targeted at Corps . drummers , but if you 're looking for a lengthy stick that 's a bit thicker than a 5B , but not quite as fat as a 2B , you 'll dig these sticks . They 're incredibly durable ( as you 'd expect from the King of drum stick companies ) but also quite light . There 's not a lot of weight for the size of these sticks . I ended up paying full price for each pair , and was out nearly a hundred bucks on the brick . While I slightly over - paid , I still consider them very worth it . As soon as the twelve I bought ran out , I 'll probably go buy 12 more pairs .
4 #### Originally I had Apple 's inarguably over - priced , but well fitted and un - bulky bumper case on my iPhone 4 . Over time the silicone peeled off the sides and , eventually , the plastic broke . Not willing to pay the premium for the bumper ( got the original through the free case program ) , I purchased a cheap - o silicone case . And it was , well , cheap . Poorly fitted and constantly falling off , it became stretched out and unusable over time . This case fits very tightly , I like the smooth , matte finish and it manages to offer protection without adding too much bulk . Obviously not as sleek as a case - free iPhone , I feel like , especially with a child who loves to play with ( and drop ) my phone , a case is a necessary evil and , at least in my limited use so far , this seems like a good one .
5 #### I used to live in Seattle and this was a must . If the vehicle is moving around 30 or more the wipers are not necessary , great vision ! It is important to follow the directions . If you do n't it wo n't work properly . One application is good for a couple of weeks of Seattle weather - daily rain .
5 #### These work so much better than expected , had them on rear , put on front too for better Ice control . simple to install ( with tires off )
5 #### If you like this , then you should also buy Duct Tape and you will be able to fix anything in the world .
4 #### The Remo Ambassador is a very nice head all - around , even for the snare . I have a 14 inch on my snare . The sound is warm and poppy . Has a decent crack to it but definitely not the head you would use for heavy music . I actually like the ring this head produces but if ring is n't your thing then you can easily dampen with tape or a moongel . A little tiny bit thin but for a single ply it sounds nice . My favorite feature is the incredible rebound . I used to use a Coated Controlled Sound Reverse Dot on my snare and moving to this is heaven as far as action is concerned .
5 #### The air bags work great for leveling my truck when towing my camper . I use a load leveling hitch , but it is not enough to level the truck . I also installed the 25592 Load Controller II compressor system . It took one evening to install the air bags and half the next day for the controller . I 'm a stickler for detail . It may take a more experienced auto accessory installer less time than I.
5 #### I love lactate products and this low strength formula is just what I needed .
2 #### I got this on the recommendation of a friend . After speaking with him while he was using this headset , which was crystal clear , I asked my buddy what kind of headset he was using . He told me this one . So I picked this up on Amazon . I used it with a Sprint Sanyo phone and the performance was terrible . I lived with it since I knew I was going to upgrade soon . I upgraded my phone to a iphone with AT&T , it was even worse . Turns out my buddy was using a Samsung phone . We think that this works great coupled with a Samsung phone but it seems to dislike other brands . In the end , it ended up getting washed in a pair of my pants and did n't work any more . Good riddance ! I picked up a Plantronics headset and have not looked back !
3 #### It is of good quality the only complaint is the cork seal leaks
4 #### I really like this harmonica . I wanted to love it . I find the higher notes tend to be much brighter than the Hohner harps which I 've played extensively . Overall , I find Lee Oskar 's to consistently project more than Hohner . However , this is my second Lee Oskar harp that feels like it " catches " just a bit on my lips when I play . It 's not enough to cut or be abrasive in any way . It just feels far more uncomfortable and like it SHOULD cut . I ca n't really explain it better . I just know that even though these work better on stage as far as being loud and really throwing out the sound , I still grab the Hohner when I can just because it 's more comfortable to play .
4 #### I love this product its not to small and not to big the led flashlight works great for leaving work at night or coming home at night the lazer light works great for work presentations or walking a store and pointing out product in the oberhead I have a iphone 4s it charges it to a full charge once and a half for my galaxy note 2 or my galaxy s3 it charges it almost to a full charge so either of my phone makes it through a 12 hour work day and more I definately would recomend this product to anybody that needs a extra charge
5 #### Almost perfect , same color code , almost all needed connections . Missing dimmer wire to control display brightness . Makes for easier installation .
5 #### Works well for securing a car cover . It wo n't stop a thief who is determined .
5 #### Awesome . I 've always had a mirrored screen protector and always will . Great product and no bubbles !
4 #### This item is much smaller than I imagined , which is great . I leave this between my two front seats and have a seat warmer , gps , and phone plugged in all at the same time . Friends also appreciate the extra ports so they can charge their phones as well . The blue light is a bit bright for me and can be a little bit distracting . Otherwise , I think its great .
3 #### This is a basic network adapter that works well and does it job . If that is what you are looking for , you ca nt go wrong with it .
4 #### not what I expected .... but it 's growing on me . Works extremely well .
4 #### Okay , first off : it 's very good . I like it a lot and have been using it since I received it . However , it 's just a * speck * too big on all four sides , so , if I use the edge of the screen ( top and sides ) or the buttons , I have to " push " it out of the way a little . No biggie for me , but I 'm sure there are those who will be driven mad by this .
5 #### I 've been using this product for years to keep carb jets and injectors clean and performing well . I dump a can of this stuff in the case tank at least once every six months and I 'm convinced it is why the engine performs so well . ~Bill
5 #### This is the only way to go with high speed polishers . My air powered polisher used to have a connecting nut in the center of the disc . One slip up and you totally wrecked your paint job . I purchased the entire system years ago you must have the HUB ASSEMBLY TO USE THESE . Its a velcro system that attaches to any polishing system . the 3 stage system is the only way to go for severe cases of neglect . CUT , CLEAN , POISH . thus i bought the RED for cut , Yellow for clean , Beige for polish . I do n't reccomend mixing waxes as that s why I have the 3 stage system
5 #### especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit
5 #### Fantastic stuff . Love the results I get with the new black paint job on my ' 90 Vette . The body shop turned me on to this and it is utterly amazing . If you love a shiny car , this is what you need to use twice a year between wax jobs .
5 #### Works as described . Arrived as pictured . Such a good thing not hearing my hitch bang around all the time with this installed .
3 #### Only three lights up in the air , and I 'm worried about ... everything . It tilts to one side ... and wobbles- The fine threaded screws stripped at a gig , leaving me with a 5 ' light stand . The hardware was replaced , and i drilled pin holes to keep my lights up . one bump and my T - bar spins in circles . The tubing in very skinny , and the legs are springy . it lasted about 6 months .
5 #### Bought this so I know what my truck is doing while i 'm working on various things . Easy to hook up , looks good and comes with everything you need .
5 #### It 's unusual for Seller to show an assembly without additional photo of the actual product being sold . The " Assembly " shown ( at time of review ) can led you to believe this is the only part needed to connect your camera to Meade telescope . You 'll also need a T - Mount Adapter for your exact model camera that costs about the same .
5 #### excellent product , to receive review and arrived in good condition and well protected in its packaging , aprte that product quality is very good , I can only say that I am satisfied with my purchase
5 #### The best little cable ties available , especially for the price .
3 #### I think headsets work better with some phones than with others . Both my wife and I have used Plantronics headsets and they worked fine . We switched to the Jawbone and while sounds slightly better than the Plantronicsand the " noise canceling " may work great in some environments but I tend to walk the dog in an area that is very windy and the noise canceling does not work all that great under these conditions . In terms of use , putting the Jawbone on your ear is a " learned " experience meaning once you figure out a method for putting it on it becomes easier . Once on ( as is the difference with working better with some phones than with others ) headsets may fit some peoples profiles better than others . Personally , the Jawbone never feels securely attached to my ear and turning it on and off is not the easiest , as the main on / off button is hard to push and it feels like it is going to break . We did replace one of the Jawbone headset 's because it broke where the ear hook goes through the ear piece . Before purchasing the latest Jawbone we could have purchased the newer version but the reviews on it were not that impressive . I think headset technology still has a way to go in terms of improvements .
4 #### Was having trouble with my trailer lights . The old connector was not designed to work well with the 4 pin connector on my truck so I replaced it with this product . All lights work perfectly now and I could n't be any happier about it . Great product for a great price .
5 #### I got my Blackberry Pearl about a week ago ... and I LOVE it . How cool is it that I can check my AOL email right on my phone ? ? The same phone that I can take awesome pictures with , send them by email or Picture mail to friends and family , go to websites , text message , play games , watch tv ... this phone has endless things to do . It 's just like having a little palm sized computer ! ! I find myself spending hours playing with it ... I used to see people doing that with their phones and wonder what the heck ? ? ? Now I know ! ! And do n't be scared ! ! I thought it would be so hard to learn things ... but they actually have a website , blackberry.com , that has little tutorials and all kinds of helpful tidbits that made sense , and were easy for me to pick up on . I 'm so thrilled I chose this phone ... I've been looking for months , and was just scared to get a phone I thought would be too complicated for me . I 'm so glad a friend of mine talked me into this . I got a red pearl , which thrills me even more , lol . This is a wonderful phone , and pretty easy to to do ANYTHING you want on . Get you one , you 'll love it ! !
5 #### I 'm using this with my 32 " tv and I love it . The price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores ( walmart , best buy ) . I found this to be an easy install and very secure . The swivel is smooth and I can orient my television perfectly . It also has plenty of VESA mount patterns so it will hold just about any TV .
5 #### Works as good as any cable you can buy in your local store , just at a much cheaper price .
5 #### This is the real thing for open celled leather , the real quality leather you get in Saddles , high end furniture , top of the line Mercedes , etc . ( I think it 's called Napa Leather in cars ) . Most leather upholstery now is sealed with a waterproof or repellent finish , which does n't let this stuff in and it can get sticky on the surface , attracting dirt instead of protecting the actual leather , which is below the finish . For purists , you have to apply it to the back of sealed leather , so it soaks into the leather itself , softening and moisturizing it . Ask any professional upholsterer and you 'll get real advise on this . Rule of thumb , if the leather is n't billed as raw , or the highest quality or most expensive available , it 's probably sealed . Since most folks do n't take care of their leather , the sealing helps prolong it 's life , but not nearly as long as real , well cared for open leather .
5 #### LOVE these lens on my Canon Rebel G. Takes great photos and lightweight , fits perfectly onto my film camera .
5 #### Works , fit for ASUS was good , length was good , no complaints . Good Value for the money , a must have to use apps like white board on your tablet .
5 #### I had a snowblower that was beginning to run roughly . I replaced the carburetor and it still was not smooth . I used this and you would n't believe how well it runs now . Much cheaper than taking it to someone else to repair .
5 #### Look nice in my 2012 Ram . Could be a little wider but will work fine .
5 #### Great strings . Last many months ( with intermittent playing and in case storage in between.-- holds tune and doesn'y discolor / oxidize as much as other strings .
2 #### I found this bluetooth to thick to fit comfortably behind my ear . It is way to thick . When I used it and tried it out , I did enjoy the sound quality but I could n't wear it .
5 #### Like most car detail enthusiasts , I never liked to see 3 hours of detailing work destroyed in a couple of days of driving and parking . With this brush , my detail jobs last longer . The brush is gentle on the clear coat but it does sweep the dust away , leaving water and and bird droppings behind . For best results , I recommend that you clay clean the car with a good car clay and wax it with S100 car wax every few months . Then using this brush , you can maintain your car in show room condition for a long time without having to wash it .
5 #### Great product , watch out for the compatibility issues on the different chargers . Make sure your charger works with the blue dot tips .
5 #### My Jeep grand cherokee has clad wheels which I ca n't use acid based cleaners on . I literally drove my jeep 200k miles without cleaning brake dust off the rims and they looked awful . I Figured i would give the jeep a sprucing up at 200k miles so i bought this product because it could stay on the rims for an extended period , and wo n't damage clad wheels . This product took the 200k miles worth of brake dust off with little to no effort . I sprayed it on gave it a scrub , and let it sit for an hour with an occasional scrub and an additional squirt or two every now and then . When I pressure washed the rims after the hour the rims looked shiny and new . I plan on using this product from now on .
5 #### Great sticks , they have lasted me many practices and gigs .
2 #### These did not go on well , lots of air pockets and the touch screen was not as responsive .
4 #### Does the job . No complaints . I have my apple tv , computer , xbox and 2 open lines to additional rooms for whatever and no issues .
2 #### I originally wanted the Weathertech fitted hard type mats but they were n't available for my vehicle . This type was and considering companie 's quality reputation I figured they 'd be good . They are n't any better than what is available at your local discount auto store . When I contacted the vendor I bought them from and said I was dissatisfied , they said I could return them at my expense and then be charged a restocking fee . Considering the hassle and expense of returning them , I just decided to keep them . Very poor value . Save your money and buy generic mats . Considering they were supposed to be custom fit mats , , it was pretty sad that I had to trim the drivers side mat to fit right ! If Weathertech has one of their molded mats available for your vehicle , I 'd buy it , but I ca n't recommend this mat at all ( for the price ) .
5 #### I love these for acoustic guitar . Pretty thin and allow for a loose grip giving a nice percussiveness to strumming . Tightening grip allows for louder arpeggiated playing . These are my favorites by far .
3 #### This guitar is good for the money and looks really nice . However , it 's not very stable and loses its tuning quickly .
4 #### I installed and charged the new batteries in my portable bug zapper . No annoying flying outdoor pest can resist the chance of a lifetime to try and successfully pass thru the maze of wires in the bug zapper . So far none have survived .
2 #### Does not work properly Had to return it Tryed hooking something up only about 50 feet and would not get signal from that distance
5 #### Pros : Full system in a small case . Cons : having t use 2 usb portsto transfer and power system is a drawback . Overall a good external system
5 #### This is a good skin case , it adjust perfectly to the phone . Very good protection .
4 #### Nice bright lights and the fog / driving variation is a good touch , save having two different sets of lights , the illuminated switch is a bonus .
5 #### Comes with step by step instructions . Great and cheap investment to recharge your filters regularly . This will last for a while judging by the amount you will use per recharge .
5 #### As stated . Excellent product but the earclip broke 2 days after receipt . Not sellers fault I have big ears ! Thank you .
1 #### these plugs easily fall out regardless of what one of the three foam pieces you use . They are uncomfortable and hard to insert even if you follow the directions and suggestions here . I recommend the sony in earphones about $ 25
1 #### I wanted a laser cleaner , not a bunch of programs that I have no use for .
5 #### I love these ... they are priced reasonably , shake nice , and I 've not had a problem so far . It 's a great way to teach your kids how to keep a beat , or just shake away !
3 #### Works fine , but the life of the charge is really low , not quite 200 pictures .
5 #### This product is great . It really fits egornomically on your head and of course its adjustable . The microphone extension is also adjustable . The sound quality is excellent , sounds clear and no loss of quality . The microphone records well too and at low volumes it does n't pick up those annoying external sounds recording very clearly . All in all this is a great deal ...
5 #### Love these little egg shakers . I took these with me on retreat and they were a big hit during our song fests .
5 #### As a female guitarist it 's hard to find a slide to fit my little finger that is n't too heavy ... this slide a a great fit , and not heavy . I 'll buy from this company again . fast shipping , well packaged .
5 #### GNARLY BOX . ENOUGH ROOM TO PUT 2 GALAXY S 2 PHONES , A FEW CARDS AND SOME SMOKES IN WHEN GOING NEAR WATER . SORT OF WISH I BOUGHT THE DEEPER ONE , BUT THIS IS COOL FOR LIGHT APPLICATIONS . TESTED IT MYSELF , DEF . IS WATER PROOF AND EVEN FLOATS . SWEET DEAL .
5 #### These worked great and charge the phone well I am glad I bought them . I needed an extra set of chargers because I travel quite a bit and wanted one set to keep at home and one to keep in my bag .
3 #### I 've had three of these in about 20 months . The first two stopped charging . I emailed Plantronics and they sent me one replacement . The earpiece now becomes loose very easily , and I 've been lucky to avoid losing it . Enough . I replaced the 510 with a Jawbone Icon , " The Hero , " along with a box of Acoustibuds . The combination is a substantial improvement . I picked that Jawbone model because , according to the Amazon ratings , it seemed to suffer from less controversy than other Jawbone models . The sound quality and volume are much better and the speed of bluetooth connection and call connection seem faster . So far , so good . If 6 - 7 months is a respectable life for a bluetooth headset , then I would have to raise my star rating for the 510 . The Jawbone is better , but more expensive .
4 #### Good sticks . The print seems to come off quite easily ... but they work fine .
5 #### This stuff is amazing . I asked a local parts store what I should get for my wife 's car to clean the injectors and fuel system , he recommended sea foam . I was hesitant but went ahead and got a bottle . I drove her car to the gas station and it sounded like it always did , after I put the entire bottle I to the tank along with a new fuel that car sounded a bit quieter . I was n't sure at first ( I wanted to make sure I was n't having a placebo effect ) but after driving for another 30 minutes i was certain . The car is quieter than it ever has been , has more power and it starts better than ever . i am completely sold !
5 #### I have a long commute to work and wish not to hold my phone . I got this to help things out while behind the wheel . I am able to use voice commands to call a person on my contact list . The layout is nice , feels sturdy , and easy to use . what is really nice about this one is that I only needed to charge this every 4 months while keeping it switched ON the entire time . I would have to switch it OFF and back ON for it to SYNC to my phone . A little annoyance but nothing major . The profile is thin and does n't take too much space on your car visor . I have recommended this one to others in my family . another nice thing is that one came with a car charger , which works great to charge devices while I 'm driving .
1 #### Fast shipping as always via Amazon Prime . This steering wheel cover advertises it to be " Genuine Leather " . I think that 's a bit of an over statement . The one I received seemed like it was made from half leather and then half " pleather " . The construction was very good and it seemed to be well made , but the quality of the leather used leaves a bit to be desired . The fit was perfect and if they had used a better quality of leather , I would have gave it a 5 star rating .
5 #### This is by far the best of any of the case / covers I have seen for this phone ! Do n't let it fool you ; it is indeed a " hard " case , but the feel is nice : it 's a textured , rubber - grip feel that ensures your phone wo n't slip out of your hand . I suggest that if it gets too oily from time to time , just use one of those eyeglass cleaning wipes . I almost forgot : there is a plug that comes with this case ! VERY convenient for those of us who wo n't be using the belt clip - it just snaps right in ! With that plug , you 're not left with a " gaping hole " in the back just because you decided not to use the belt clip . Also , the plug can be removed if you want to use the clip stand for watching YouTube , etc . Other than the clear screen protector , this is a great , INEXPENSIVE way to protect you investment . Do yourself and your phone a favor and pick this case up !
5 #### Nice spot mirror for avoiding a blind spot . Good quality and I am happy with it .
5 #### Honestly words ca nt describe how awesome this product is . If you are even considering buying one , do n't doubt me when I say you wo n't regret it . This is something that everyone should have in there garage , because who wants tar or bugs on their car ... Not only are tar and bugs ugly , they 're not good for the clear coat or the paint on the car . With a little soap , water , and some extra elbow grease , you 're car can be back to its normal , happy self . This product is totally safe on clear coat , and I can see this easily holding up even after 2 years .
2 #### I bought this thinking I was going to get an upgrade to the 500 . Unfortunately , though it was smaller , the ear piece was larger so I could n't get the jabba gel over it . Without the gel , the ear piece just sat on the ear which made it unstable when moving . Also unlike the 500 , this was quiet and difficult to hear or be heard . The 500 was loud with the jabba gel .
5 #### Seems to be very high quality , I have n't used any cheaper alternatives in the past , so I can not make comparisons to other products . The price is high , but I am happy that it is made in the USA . When I initially installed it in my 2007 Accord Sedan , the shade fit snugly from top to bottom , but left a gap on both ends side - to - side . I am hoping that it will cover the gaps once the sun relaxes the wrinkles out of the material . I did not need to use my visors to support the shade , since it was a press - fit against the edge of the headliner .
5 #### I 'm very pleased with this card . It is real simple to install . Just turn of the camera and pull out the old card and pop the ScanDisk card in . If you you the card with a Olympus D460 camera , you can take over 300 pictures at highest resolution . For a little more money than the Olympus 32 mb card you get twice the capacity . The only difference is that you ca n't take panoramic shots . Save your 8 mb card for that . The nice thing about the added memory for the camera is now I can take it on vacation and snap as many pictures as I want without worrying about downloading them to a PC . My next purchase will be a USB card reader because the serial connection on my digital camera is painfully slow .
3 #### The step looks nice , however , the part that fits into the hitch receiver is somewhat smaller and , as a result , the step rattles around inside the receiver even with the pin in place . the step I received does not sit level in the receiver but rather on an angle downward on the right side . It just does not look right when it is in place .
4 #### the skin is very well made and very precise . I would prefer more skin around the front of the blackberry .
5 #### Product was thought out very well . Easy install , everything worked as advertised . Looks cleaner than the oem one did . All connections and wires are made of quality parts and nothing felt like cheap knock - offs . Much better than expected for the price .
5 #### Works perfectly at 1080p HD and in all other Canon EOS 7d modes . Costs less than 1/4 the price of the Canon equivalent . Expensive " high end " cables are a scam . It would be crazy to pay more . Tip : If you have never tried displaying your HD video or stills on an HD TV through an HDMI input , you will be shocked by the magnificent quality . Absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs .
3 #### I loved these when they initially arrived ... great sound , comfort and function . I used them constantly for work and even when sleeping to listen to guided meditations and relaxing music to help me sleep ( light sleeper ) . But some things to be aware of : A ) they soon started rattling in left side after about 3 - 4 months . B ) they are extremely fragile - especially the jack - and after only 6 months - stopped working altogether . Really disappointed because I now live in a country Amazon does not service - so I 'm unable to replace them .
5 #### This is an stellar addition to the sometimes " lack luster " portable battery chargers that have infiltrated the mobile phone accessory market . In the case of the IMP500 , the compact size , ease of use , rapid ability to charge a dead phone on a plane or in the middle of a desert , combined with an ample capacity , makes this a dependable asset to your " must have " accessories .
5 #### The double rack is well made and sturdy . Also it is versatile as to mounting applications . I would recommend this product . The only down is that they are made in China .
4 #### Depending of what do you have in mind this one can be a good choice , You will have a great tone and sound during unplugged , recording sessions , and little rehersals . Do not wait for a great backup during a venue performing because it is out of its range .
3 #### My son and I purchased two of these ; one for my phone and one for his Ipod . One of them charges both but the other one only works on my phone . The company sent us another one but it has the same issue . The product is ok but it does n't have enough power to give my phone a full charge .
5 #### these were a great addition to my gps but i wish i did n't have to buy everything seperatly but this is necessary to the gps
4 #### work great to help keep screen clean , the screen on my phone I used these to just test out and they help it stay clean
5 #### These string have a clean bright sound . They are impressive and well worth the cost . I went from light to these and will not go back .
5 #### The first thing that you should do is stretch out these headphones until you no longer feel them gripping your head when you put them on . You should feel more force on the top of your head than on the sides . Otherwise , you 're going to get a headache . For the longest time , I thought that the headaches I got while wearing them were just because I was n't used to them yet . Aside from the headache issue , they 're the best headphones I 've ever had . I love the stretchy cord ( helical , like an old corded phone ) . The audio is fantastic . I just compared them to my GF 's MDR - ZX100 ZX , and the difference is night and day .
5 #### I saved over $ 15 and I't works better then one that came with my phone and the signal booster really works , this product is well worth the buy as well as the wait for shipping best of all it comes straight to your mail box !
5 #### Work great for my 05 Trailblazer . I can see how there would be clearance issues with a car .
5 #### I had several capos and none of them seems tpo work on any 12 string guitar . This one not only works , its extremely easy to use and , to be honest , quite gorgeous . I love it . trully worthy for the price .
5 #### I was looking for something to install on the rear of my 5th wheel for backup lights . The design of these lights fit the bill perfectly . They make a nice clean installation and enhance the look of the trailer . I 'm very happy with my purchase . Gary
5 #### I have been purchasing these strings for over 15 years now . Only string that I allow to touch my electric guitars .
5 #### Worked like a charm for my 04 F350 SD / SC King Ranch , anyone that installs a newer head unit without one of the harnesses is just asking for trouble . No sense in cutting into your factory harness . just let this do it for you . Recommend you solder your connections and shrink wrap or electrical tape all connections , As always , a great Metra Harness ....
3 #### I have tried Zagg and some other screen protectors . Zagg gives rubbery feeling as compared to ifrogz which was more glass like feel .
5 #### These strings are great . They are n't as bright as flat wound but are still punchy . Best of all they are easy on the fingers which helps keep my teenager motivated while she 's learning .
5 #### I used this combined with a custom earmold , and it works excellent . So easy to hear people , and everyone says I sound great .
1 #### I bought the Smile to have a handy , inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages . I did n't want to spend $ 400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months . I figured for $ 100 I could n't go wrong . I was mistaken . The Smile just has too many compromises . The lens is a tiny fixed - focus item that requires bright light to form an image . Battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures . I should have spent $ 200 and gotten a far better camera .
3 #### It works for what it is , it just feels a little light when you wind after getting the tension up . Not a bad product , just do n't know how long it will last .
5 #### Handy little item . I use it almost every time I 'm on my iPad . It keeps the finger prints off the screen .
4 #### Bought the case for my wife -- she 'd tried two other cases that either did n't look all that great or were too soft . This was perfect , in style , cost and fit .
5 #### Well made , works well . What more can you ask for ?
5 #### WOW ! I had tempered my expectations for a $ 40 pair of headphones and these headphones blew those expectations out the water . I own Grados ( SR80 , SR325e ) , reference AKGs , and have listened through several noise cancelling buds , over the ear and on the ear models . This one is easily the best value for money . Leaving aside the cost for a moment , I would say the comfort , portability , sound quality make this a fantastic headphone on the go , at work , or even at home , if you do n't have headphone amplifier for the better sounding but higher impedance / lower efficiency headphones . The audio profile is certainly not flat like a reference pair , and definitely has more bias towards the lower / mid range but it 's not overwhelming .
3 #### When I first bought this headset , I was pretty satisfied . It handled voice dialing with my Nokia well , and the sound quality was generally good on both ends . The over - the - ear receiver was comfortable and did n't fall off . However , it has exhibited two shortcomings . First , the size is rather awkward . It does n't fit inside my cell phone case with the phone like my previous headsets would . Second , the sound quality , especially on the receiving end , deteriorated over a few months . This seems to be a very common problem with bluetooth headsets . I 've had three different headsets that started out good , but after roughly six months became unintelligible on receiving side . I 'm guessing it 's something to do with the microphone . Fortunately , this one is cheap enough that replacing it is just an annoyance and not a mahor cost hit .
5 #### We camp every month and it is a challenge keeping electronic devices like phones and iPads charged through the weekend . In the woods you seldom have access to a wall outlet , and the solar charger seems good just for a 75 % charge on one device . Memorial weekend I took the Trent : iTorch IMP52D - ( 5200mAh ) that I had charged the prior week . It was small and sleek and easy to pack or pocket . It charged my iPhone twice and still had 50 % power come Monday morning . Small enough to fit in your hand , but not at all wimpy , it feels very solid and able to stand up to heavy use . While it did not come with a wall adapter , the iCarrier that I bought at the same time did and it is interchangeable , otherwise you can use your device charger and its USB cable . The product is simple and easy to use , no need to pack an instruction book , which is a bonus when you want to travel light . The added flashlight and laser pointer are just icing on the cake . I ca n't wait to take this and the iCarrier IMP120D - ( 12000mAh ) charger for a week long summer camp . I 'm sure I will be supplying energy for my entire troop .
5 #### Nice basic guitar strap .. Great price and should last long enough . I have started using the padded Levies strap as it does nt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap . This can be a little scratchy
4 #### Once I realised that you needed to scratch the Rosin to get it started it worked great . Very easy to use and gets the bow going quickly .
5 #### Looks great , works great , quick shipping ! I would recommend to others .
5 #### This battery replaces the same battery purchased back in 2001 . Nine years of trouble free abuse is n't too bad . Often would leave the bike for six months or more without riding . Anyway if your a rider that may get a bit too busy to ride for periods of time . Leave your bike unattended this is the battery for you .
5 #### The MDR - V6 Headphones work great , and I am completely satisfied with them . The sound is as was expected and the ' fit ' was n't too snug . A great headset with a great price ! I watched numerous reviews on various headphone reviews and , for the price , this was the one . For listening to music and being able to relax without distracting ' outside ' noise , this one works great !
4 #### Fits perfect in the odd shaped oval hole in a 98 Beetle .
4 #### I formerly had the BlueAnt which worked well and kept its charge for a prolonged period ... but charging it remained a real pain . The long periods between charging lulled me into forgetting to charge and I would be left with a dead device . The Solchat2 remains charged due to the solar panel . Sound quality is good in both directions . I LOVE having it announce the caller and I also LOVE being able to tap the button and voice dial . Here is the key to voice dialing with the iphone ( With or without the solchat ): You must say " dial " Last name , then First name , then home , mobile or other location . If you say the first name first and then last name , it is very innaccurate . If you say the last name first , it works extremely accurately . The solchat2 allows me to dial and answer easily and without distraction . The suction cup sleeve for it is quite ingenious . It has pads which maintain the pressure so the suction cups do n't fail .. and you can slip the device in and out of the sleeve . I love this device and highly recommend it . MAKE SURE YOU ARE GETTING THE NEW DEVICE ... THE SOLCHAT2 ... THE PRODUCT LABELING IS CONFUSING BUT YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU ARE GETTING BY LOOKING AT THE MODEL NUMBER UNDER THE DESCRIPTION WHICH STATES CBHSOL2
4 #### I bought this to cover my 1994 Chev Blazer full size truck . The cover fits a little tight and takes some doing to get it on the truck but it fits and covers the vehicle nicely . I may buy the next larger size next time as these do n't last forever in the sun . I bought this cover just to see how it lasts and may get a more expensive cover next time . So far I am happy with the way it performs .
5 #### These were exactly what I needed to cover my trailer plug . The contacts corrode slowly over time and I wanted to cover them while the trailer is just sitting around . ( most of the time ) These fit perfectly and are doing the job .
4 #### I mostly due private home recordings and I use these to record my drums cymbals . They sound alright , I wo n't bother replacing them unless they stop working . You definitely need a mixer with phantom power to get the best sound so heads up on that . But yeah they sound pretty good . Most of the sound is dialed in through the mixers and the rest is edited through my recording software . I 'm not sure you 'll ever find a " perfect " Mic that does n't require some editing .. so they work fine .
5 #### This was given as a gift and were much appreciated
5 #### Amazons fitment guide said this would fit a 1997 Jeep Wrangler Sahara TJ so i ordered without question . When i received the product it was labeled up to a 1996 , so I became a little worried as I was doing this for a friend the day I was receiving this . Figured I would chance it anyways and make a trip to a semi local retailer to grab the correct one if this was n't . Got into it and it was perfect . Occasionally I have had harnesses that the color coding was only a partial match , this guy was exact even down the the shades of the color . Great lengths , just a perfect match all the way around .
5 #### Got this phone to get myself to a basic Android phone without too much bells and whistles , and it seems to fit that objective . The Qwerty keyboard was what prompted me to choose this model as well . And the ability to operate the phone using one hand is a plus . Shipping from the seller was prompt , although the box did not have a manual or quick start guide , downloaded one from SONY website . Great for old - timers who like simplicity .
5 #### Like them . They are small yet work as well as large ones -- less cumbersome and easier to store .
4 #### Kind it thin but the price was really cheap so for the price I think it 's great i 'm able to change them out when I do n't want the expensive one on in a certain area camping
5 #### Excellent Headphones for nighttime practice . Sound quality is exception . The only downside is its noise isolation . You can hear clearly everything around as if you did n't wear anything on your ear .
3 #### Not so good . Takes too long to charge and never made to charge to full
4 #### One of my kids decided to learn some guitar . So i dug out a couple of mine- strings we at least 10 years old . These make the instruments sound great .
5 #### Fit and work great ! A little challenge for me to get on .
4 #### Works but gets hot . Ca n't use both uses as mine gets too hot and shuts off
5 #### it worked for what it was bought for and i am sure it will work for you too just do it
5 #### This set is from heaven . I love each of the strings . The quality is superb I could not ask for more . It is the greatest deal yet ever . This is a total must have for all the guitar enthusiast out there .
5 #### I bought this to hook my tablet up to my TV and it works perfectly . The picture and sound quality is amazing and it is exactly what I needed .
5 #### Mine are 2 months old and still like new . They stay in tune great and bend nicely . No rust or corrosion , which is really surprising living in ultra humid Houston .
2 #### I have the older style , and this was my attempt to try the new style . Pros : 1 . Smaller 2 . Better fitting than original 3 . SUPER SEXY ! 4 . fits in the pocket easier 5 . Charges SUPER FAST 6 . Light as air Cons : 1 . Loop broke within 1 week ( no shocker , old style broke fast too ) 2 . Battery goes dead insanely fast , ca nt make it half the day ! 3 . Range is HORRIBLE ( less than half the old version " about 5 feet clear 10 ft scratchy with my Iphone 3 G " 4 . I think you have to turn on noise cancel every time , , or I 'm doing something wrong . 5 . Its almost too light ! You forget you have it in your ear . SUMMARY : This is an improvement over the old Jawbone which killed my ear , broke ear loops constantly , , , However , the decrease in range and battery life is a real killer . Be prepared to buy more earloops , complain to the company , and maybe even turn on the noise cancelling . IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE NOISE CANCEL AND SEXY FACTOR , I WOULD GIVE IT A 1 STAR , but apple has shown us , you CAN take your customers for a ride if you just make it look good enough ( i own 4 macs , no pc 's ) Hope this helps :)
5 #### Compact with plenty of features , the Rio 500 is an impressive machine . USB makes downloads simple and fast . The software , however , causes lots of Windows 98 " General protection faults " ( even with the newest version 2.1 ) . Overall , I like the machine and would recommend it to others .
5 #### If I hit the switch I can make the ass drop .
4 #### The fit is a little sloppy on the loose side but it does get the job done . I had a matco MST6010A it 's a better fit but I lost it . Compare the price I 'll stick with the Powerbuilt since I do n't work on honda and Acura all day
5 #### ? ? ? In this review I was asked to rate 1 - 5 stars on this product 's ease of use and sound quality - i have no idea why , as this is strictly a visual product . Anyway - I use this male to female VGA monitor extension cable to extend another 15 ' VGA cable which connects my laptop to my 46 " LCD TV . I would say I am very discerning when it comes to assessing audio / video quality and still feel the picture is nearly PERFECT . It does what it is supposed to , without any detectable degrading to the image quality or " noise . " The build feels solid and at the same time , not too rigid . I am very happy with this product . * UPDATE : This and the other cable I bought at the same time , 2.5 years ago , both seem to be working well . Neither has seen heavy abuse , so I ca n't attest to it 's road - worthiness , but in my home it still carries a strong , clear signal !
5 #### Works well . Cord is not super stretchy because it 's sort of stiff . I hooked one side to a coat hanger and something with enough weight to stretch it but not break to the other for a few days . Feels better now
5 #### This thing is quite sturdy and well - made . I carry it on my back regularly to gigs . Backpack straps were well worth the extra $ 15 . I have a low Bb bari , so there is plenty of space on the inside to stick my sax stand , low A extension , millions of reeds ( okay , maybe just hundreds ) , and shoulder harness . The front pocket - on the lid - is the perfect size to put my Yamaha pochette clarinet case in . The back pocket is big enough for sheet music but not a binder . This thing will last for ages .
5 #### These headphones are excellent . I was a bit worried when I read reviews that the cables were flimsy and needed to be replaced . I have been using them every day since purchasing and they are holding up just fine . Overall , the sound is bright and crisp .
4 #### This style battery was around $ 45 at the local battery store , so $ 16 from Amazon with free shipping was a no - brainer . This is the exact brand / model battery that was in my home alarm system , and that battery lasted 2 + yeas , so I would expect similar results from this one .
5 #### I 've found these strings to be comfortable , long - lasting , and sound great . Packaging is compact and that helps keep space in my bag .
5 #### This gig bag is quite versatile . Padding is also top notch to protect the instrument . The padding can be moved around for a very snug fit . While not a hard shell case , this type of gig bag is excellent for regional gigs and travel .
1 #### I returned because it is just too much work to install and I find it hard to believe they would make much difference .
4 #### If you follow the instructions ( that is why they are there ) this lock will work just fine , I have never had it " mysteriously " change combination on me . There are only two problems with this little lock , the first is , it tends to seize up on occasion , but it comes out after a few seconds ( not 5 minutes as mentioned by another reviewer ) . Also , this lock is fairly easy to change the combo , so if you have a roommate that hates you , or criminals that carry around screwdrivers , you may be in a bit of trouble . This is a MECHANICAL lock , it does not have a " mind o it 's own . "
5 #### I just upgraded from an old Nokia ( not even a flip phone , but I 'm still sad to not be using it anymore . ) The main draw to this model was the QWERTY keyboard , since I frequently text . I must say , this phone was easy to use straight from the box . There are plenty of features , and over all , I 'd have to say it 's got a lot of bang for the buck .
5 #### like every wax job on cars or trucks it takes alittle elbow grease , but this product works with ease 3 steps but when you get to the last step it is very much worth the time and the money , especially taking it to a detail shop,50 bucks to 250 bucks , , speaks for itself .
4 #### The carring case protects from scratches and you can carry it on your belt by your side . You can operate the GPS with out taking it out ofthe case .
5 #### Tried other " plastic cleaners " but this really works . My husband travels 160 miles round trip daily on highways . The dirt & bugs were constantly a problem until we discovered this . It 's a keeper ! And of course , Amazon.com has the best price .
5 #### This bundle will save you soooo much money . And if you 're an artist , you need to save as much money as possible .
1 #### I bought two of these , one for each car . The clear plastic cap that you see is not well anchored to the body . When you 're uplugging a cable it 's easy to pull off that cover -- and then the whole thing comes apart , and you 'll see what a piece of junk it is . That happened to both of them that I bought . I tried with each to get it back together but it was impossible . There 's a better , similar - looking device from Scosche that I bought when these failed . It 's much more rugged -- more powerful , also -- and it wo n't fall apart in your hand when to try to unplug a cable .
1 #### Purchased in 2011 . Pumped about 10 tubes of cartridge grease thru the gun and now the follower seal has failed , became stiff , causing grease to bypass to the rear of the barrel . Repair parts and shipping cost more than a new gun . I expected better quality from Lincoln .
2 #### I had to replace the locks on my Summit cargo box after I broke the last key and part of it remained stuck in a lock . The good news - I was able to remove the lock with the provided tool / key even it still had part of the old key in it . I was surprised by how little resistance these locks provide against tampering . For this kind of money I would expect something more substantial .
5 #### I have one of these in every car . It really does keep your phone right within sight , easy to use , easy to reach , and easy to see without having to touch it . Depending on the type of phone and battery , you may or may not need to use the stick on magnet on your phone . If you do , it is very thin , does not get in the way , and you may be able to hide it behind your battery cover or phone cover . Then you stick the larger part inside your car ( which is actually very small itself ) it is very low profile attched to your vehicle , my dash is black , so it blends in no problem . and your phone is safe from rolling around , and within easy reach to accept a call , or close enough to use hands free . It has fallen off the magnet one time while I was driving over a curb ( which normally you would n't do anyway ) but if you do a lot of off roading or drive over curbs often this may not work for you . Stays put for all speed bumps , and such regular road hazards , including fast braking , and sharp turns .
5 #### Work great I use them on my wife 's Mini Cooper and my Ford Edge Could do with larger ones for the Ford Edge The welds on mine look really good .
4 #### I was n't looking for a permanent holder here that never comes out of the cup holder . I was looking for something I can stick in there and use when I need the GPS on my phone . This works fine for that . That said , the complaints of other reviewers have merit . The fit is n't snug and the item does come out of the cup holder , which can be really inconvenient . I personally like it because it fits my individual needs , but if you want a permanent fix this may not be a good purchase . Also , my cup holder sits between the seats in the front , and my sleeves catch on the holder sometimes , pulling it out of the cup holder . I have a small car with bucket seats , and realize that a lot of cars have a bit more space between your elbows and your cup holders , but it 's something to know if you have a smaller car .
4 #### Love my stylus , although the rubber is a little too squishy and does n't work too well on my iPad covered by the otterbox . The stylus does work well on the iPhone screen and the screen with the protector on it ....
5 #### A must have to save gas on that riding mower . I clean it each time with vacuum for the foam filter and compressed air for the paper cartridge . I install a new one each year .
4 #### This is a basic sound card . Nothing fancy . The thing that seperates it from the rest is that Creative is a huge company and has drivers available for all Windows ( the Linux / BSD world probably supports this thing , I have n't checked ) . This is as close to plug and play as you can get . That guy who ranted about this card crashing his system needs to buy a clue and check his IRQs , not to mention dump Windows ME ( which * Microsoft * does n't even stand by ) .
5 #### Lightweight , compact and does the job . I use this for my digital mixer and power conditioner . It keeps everything protected when moving and does n't take up unnecessary space when being used .
5 #### This is very lightweight and slips into your purse , pocket or briefcase . What is great is that the company will ship tips for your device and all you pay is the shipping . This has been a great gift to college students going off to college and it was a big hit as stocking stuffers for moms , dads , road warriors and anyone who finds themselves screaming when they find their phone readlining or DOA . It 's a nice quality device , will charge a smartphone to 1 full charge .
5 #### This has always been my favorite Bluetooth headset . It is n't the most attractive headset , but it works the best . I 've tried too many to list ( including the ever popular JawBone ) but I prefer this headset over all others .
5 #### this is my favorite gauge of pic and that little hollow is very smart
5 #### I 'm sure there are higher priced / better binoculars but for this price I think u ca n't get much better . Awesome Bushnell quality . I take these on any trip to the outdoors . I would n't really go for higher magnification for hand held binoculars unless u have a very steady hand . Would buy these again
5 #### Perfect . Love the green . Now I know who stole my capo .
4 #### Removes oil , grime , grease , etc ... from your brakes and can be used for other purposes as well . Dissolves well , does the job , , gets all the gunk off . Works as specified , Only downside is the smell . Proper ventilation is advised . Recommended for tough jobs .
5 #### Great product for the price . Stuck it in my work BB for extra music and what not . I can always count on Amazon to have good products at a good price .
5 #### Love this protector best thing they came up with ... it laid on the phone just perfect I will buy this product again Thanks ! !
4 #### very nice . bought to replace one that cracked while removing snow from truck . The new one is a little different from the ones purchased when the truck was new . Not a big deal .
5 #### Bought one and loved it so much I bought another . Can go tits high or slung low , depending on your preference . Extremely durable and Dunlop quality . Definitely a strap you can count on .
4 #### Great option as opposed to buying from Verizon or any of the other wireless stores . It will truly help save our screen . Took a little patience as we put it on but went just fine .
5 #### If you 're looking for a charger that can charge up your smart phone at least twice if not three times before needing to be recharged , this is for you . It 's small and easy to travel with , charges up quickly after use , and charges your devices in no time . It wo n't recharge an iPad fully but it 'll give you at least 50 % extra run time . I love the size for dropping it in a bag when I 'm on the go .
4 #### As others have mentioned , the band is a little long , but not so much that it 's a problem . Good for activities where I want to avoid getting sweat on my leather band .
3 #### This product is nice and thick and has not allowed my screen to be scratched . HOWEVER , it is very difficult to apply without getting air bubbles under the screen . My advice is to buy several so you can practice on the first few .
4 #### I wired this in a ground up restoration to move these charging ports to a behind the seat area in a pick up . Plenty of cord for the installation and easy to hook up , you can mount this directly or use 3 M to attach it to the surface .
3 #### All of the Remo drums are OK . They are a no frills frame drum which for us is fine for a drum circle .
5 #### so easy and looks good helps backing up the trailer
1 #### I thought that the mount was a flexible snake , but found that instead , the snake is rigid plastic . I could not find any way to mount it in my car such that it looked reasonable . Ended up not using it , and buying a mount that attached to the ventilator pieces , which worked a great deal better and looked better too . It was made by the same company . I do n't think anyone would buy this thing if they realized that the snake is not flexible .
5 #### I have used a number of strings , but I keep coming back to these . The superior sound quality and durability make these strings my number one choice . I think that the added B string should be included on the packaging , not just the little 7 but other than that , they play excellent . I would highly recommend .
5 #### Normally I prefer a harder pick but I switch to these after 9 pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors . These super light flexible nylon picks are great if you 're trying to play quietly . If you prefer a flexible , softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick .
5 #### These are very nice . The constitution is far superior to those from others in the price range . Received them very quick . I have the 3 ton version they look like a kids toy next to the 12ton stands .
5 #### Just what the doctor ordered to keep filter clean and saving money !
4 #### In all fairness , these meets the job for which I purchased it . However , please be aware that this is not meant to use with more than one medium to large sized smart phone . I have an iPhone se and a Galaxy S7 . I could fit one more SE but nothing larger on the available outer slot . Also , the front tray is very narrow
2 #### really too fat and clumsy to use ... you will probably go back to metal brushes ...
5 #### I needed stiffer strings to replace the light gauge strings on an electric guitar I purchased used and these fit the bill .
1 #### Out of the 5 chargers I gnly 2 of them were working I was really dissapointed and upset that they did n't work ) - ;
5 #### Cleans easy and never looses stickyness . Good in all weather conditions !
5 #### I think some of the more negative reviews may not be considering that the quality of the sound will depend a lot on what you plug into the extension cord . After all this thing is just a wire . I bought this so I would not have to fiddle with the controls on a home theater system that would otherwise boom everybody awake if I 'm watching a movie late at night . Of course it does n't have the same fidelity or frequency response of the speakers , but it is quite acceptable when used with a pair of noise cancelling headphones of decent quality .
3 #### Product arrived in good condition ... exactly as ordered ... this manual seems to be best suited for Kia 's up to 2006 . Past that , the level of detail gets a bit iffy . Will probably try Chiltons next time .
4 #### Purchase for my son . It works , it was n't to thrilled with it because it was " nothing special " variety of colors would be nice . Overall I am satisfied with the product .
2 #### Very flimsy . Came with one section broken . I could n't even be bothered sending it back . Not worth the money and to me a piece of garbage .
5 #### I had bought this for my nephew and he loved it a lot . He still has it and it has served him well . He is just now going to try to upgrade to a new phone .
5 #### 20 minutes in the dryer on low softened it up for easier stretching over the wheel on our 2002 Chevy Tahoe . Smells like new leather seats which I like but some do not . Nice soft feel . Quality piece . Seller was fast and efficient as well ...
5 #### The cable is thin , but appears to be a high quality . Connectors are well built . The volume control is easy to use , and will let you fine tune the volume to any lower volume .
3 #### Just not as clear ringing as I had expected ... okay , I 'm finicky , but my acoustic guitars [ Martin , Guild ] have to sound good !
4 #### Great basic phone . I have had it now for about two weeks and it works as advertised . Tough no nonsense phone , that will stand up to some abouse . I am hard on phones and have made this my primary phone . Found out about this phone from a CNN article on " Zombie Phones " or rather emergency phones . My old phone had trouble getting a signal and service was ok , this phone always has at least 2 - 3 bars of service when my other phone had no signal . Battery life is decent right now it is 5 - 6 days but I think I can increase that by training the battery by letting run all the way down and then recharging it . This phone does what was promised . No bells and whistles , very limited texting ability , but good for making and recieveing calls . For the price I recommend this to anyone .
5 #### I wanted a higher rating for my garage jack stands since they will be holding the Beast up while I scurry about underneath . These fit the billl . The safety bar gives me a little extra confidence and the welds look OK to my untrained eye .
2 #### I bought this cable to connect my Samsung A167 . I could n't find any software that would let the computer even detect the phone . It works as a charger for the phone .
5 #### Good stable cheap switch . It 's a great durable little switch that works perfectly for the home office or small office that does n't need a lot of ports or a managed switch .
5 #### A cheap plastic poorly made lens that you want believe.color clarity and sharpness is great.used this while on a recent vacation while waiting for the 24 - 70 that i had ordered.results made me cross my fingers that i had n't spent a lot of money for no reason .
5 #### Good purchase . Cheaper then Walmart , and the same one :D
5 #### I 've had one of these routers running on my network continuously since June , 2000 . It 'll run just fine out of the box , and it 's easy to configure through its web interface . You can easily block net requests , or pass any given protocol on to whichever computer or server you choose . Linksys has kept updating the product through the years to extend its features and offer better security . Based on experiences with other brands at my clients ' offices , the Linksys box is the most stable of all the routers in this price range ( including Belden , DLink , and others ) . I 've been recommending the Linksys wired and wireless routers to my clients , and have never seen a problem with them . What could be improved ? Well , it 'd be nice to have better logging and reporting for incoming network requests ; the current implementation is not very helpful . But for the money , this is one product that 's just hard to beat . After almost four years of flawless performance , my BEFSR has started becoming a bit flakey and needs a weekly reset . It 's about to be replaced with a new BEFSR .
5 #### I use one of these on the passenger side of my lifted truck ... it 's saved more than one smart - car from being crushed .
1 #### Unlike replacing glass on any other phone you have to take the IPhone all apart ! ! ! When we had it back together the touch screen would not work . Can you imagine that you have to disassemble your IPhone ! Do n't do it . There are sensitive electrical connectors that must be put back together perfectly . Replacing a regular cell phone glass you just replace the glass by breaking it out and putting on new glass . The IPhone you have to take the whole phone apart . It is like taking apart a broken toy or watch and messing with the insides , it hardly ever works . In our case the IPhone at least worked with a broken screen . Now we have a nice looking phone that the touch screen does n't work and we ca n't make it work after messing with it over two hours . I know the problem is the 1 , 2 and # 3 connectors . Why do I even need to know this ! It is crazy to take the phone apart to replace the glass . Next time I will pay to have it done . Even if it would have worked it takes a very steady hand and is a very craft like thing to do . If you have Parkinson disease forget it . You screws are the size of ants they are so small . It is maddening . From one Cheapskate to another pay a store to replace your broken IPhone screen .
5 #### I thought my old , trusted bottle jacks had gone to jack heaven until , on an impulse , I ordered this product . They 're all working like new now , and , best of all , no more leaking oil all over the place !
2 #### I bought this as I have been using the Sportapro for some 12 yrs . Yes believe it or not . All I am doing on them is replacing the foam pad every 2 - 3 years or so . The PortaPro does n't seem to be as solidly built like the old Sportapro . The sound quality is more or less the same . But the main problem with the Portspro is the headband . It reverts back to its unexpanded shape every time I remove the headphone . So every time I have to put it back I have to adjust the band . It is not so with the Sportapro . Also I am not sure how to adjust the comfort zone thing , It stays only at the firm position . There is no manual inside the box . The Koss web site also does not show any downloadable manual . For the above reasons , I am returning the product . I am going to get the Sportapro but I am not sure if it has the same build quality and durability as the one I have which is some 12 years old . These days every thing is cheaply made offshore to cut cost . But at the same time the build quality and durability are also compromised .
4 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/California - Car - Duster-62442 - Standard - Car - Duster - with - Wooden - Handle / dp / B00008RW9U / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">California Car Duster 62442 Standard Car Duster with Wooden Handle</a > This is the only Duster that I will ever own . It is of very good quality and will get every dust particle off your newly washed and waxed vehicle without marring the finish . The only concern I have was that I did not realize just how heavy this Duster was when I was using it for extended periods of time . This is the reason I rated it a 4 star instead of a 5 star , that , and the fact I could not give it a 4 1/2 star . It does cover a lot of surface in a short time because of its size . The mop head itself is 13 " long and and when you add the handle to it , it makes the whole Duster 24 " long . It does come with a nice plastic bag to store the Duster in when not in use . .As far as I am concerned this Duster is the best I have found anywhere . Yes , I would recommend this California Duster to anyone . I would also buy it again if I needed too !
5 #### It works , and it works like magic . The mount itself is solid and nicely constructed . It is in fact very nicely designed and engineered and well thought out . It 's easy to mount / dismount , they left room for you to plug the power cord to your phone , and the amplifying feature is simply awesome when it works so well and does n't require any power . Like all other reviewers I find this an awesome buy and you will not be disappointed .
5 #### I got tired of working with small 12 V fans so I thought I would just buy a little more expensive than that would do a good job and I 'm extremely happy with this one . It has three speeds medium and high do the best air movement . I use it in my motorhome to keep cool without using generator and air conditioner during those warm days . Very quiet , and the way to go with 12v fans .
4 #### If you 're a serious bass player , you 'll probably want to take this bass into a shop to get it properly tuned and set up . Mine had some frett buzz that was quickly fixed . Otherwise , great bass for the price . I would recommend it over and over again .
5 #### Purchasing in quantity is a great way to buy the M - tape for Brother labelers . I have been using a P - Touch for years , and love it . Practically indestructible . The one I have at my office has to be over 10 years old . Just bought a new P - Touch for home , and hope I get the same service from it . Anyway , the Brother replacement tapes have always been reliable , print well , and they are durable .
3 #### The clutch could work a whole lot better , and it 's pretty sloppy feeling , but it seems to work ok . I have no complaint other than it just seems a bit flimsy . Like I said ... It 's OK ...
4 #### A little too small for most wires . Product is fine for smaller wires and cables
5 #### Other merchants might sell various cables under this listing , hence the contradictory reviews . The ' Sold by Amazon ' version is fine for charging and data transfer on my non - Blackberry phone . ( I got it in March 2011 . ) The connectors seem fine ... both in fit and in apparent quality of the molded housing . There is no Blackberry logo on mine . Seems to be an unbranded made - in - China cable . For less than a dollar and a half delivered , I have to give it 5 stars .
5 #### I have 3 of these , Gibby LP Studio , PRS SE 245 , Epi LP St Pl Tp Pro . They are just as nice as the Gibson cases you get with a $ 2000 Lp , cause I have one of em to compare it to . The outside has a soft leather type feel and they are nice and furry inside . $ 80 bucks is a steal . LP s fit nice and snug , big pocket with cover . Key too .
5 #### This product is perfect for cleaning up the crusty burned things that seems to appear on the glass top stove . Cerama Bryte scraper and pad work wonders with them . No hard scrubbing just a little scraping with the blade and the spot is gone . Sometimes I use liquid stove top cleaner , but for quick clean ups just use the scraper and the pad . They are safe to use on the glass cook tops and are the only things I would use to clean my stove and keep it looking like new . I have been using scrapers on my stove the whole time I have owned it and never had a problem . This is the only way to keep your stove looking nice , shiny and clean .
5 #### A great kit at a good price ! I would purchase again !
5 #### I do not know how they can sell them this cheap but I brought 3 this time . I gave one to a co - worker and he loves it , listens to his earphones while taking a walk with his dog .
5 #### The iTorch , was constantly able to charge my iPhone 4S 2.5 times on one charge . The battery charged fully in one night and is small and portable but very effective . Comes with and charges with a micro - USB cord , which was useful .
5 #### It assemblies easier with a screwdriver not included . Good quality wood that will hold up the indirect water exposure in my bathroom .
5 #### great adapter for saving your micro usb charger from stress
5 #### This is my first experience with a blue tooth device . It was easy to set up and I use it all the time . I like the redial feature on the head set , but it took some time to get used to it . I ended up redialing quite a few people before I got used to the different ways the one button for several features works . Holding it for various lengths of time with do different things . The price on this is terrific & it comes with additional ear fittings . I removed the cover on the ear bud for a more comfortable fit and it does n't hurt my ear anymore when I have it on for an extended period of time . If you have a narrow ear canal you may want to do this too .
3 #### Could have done better with a signal light . Then again it would give away my position .
5 #### I am using it for an HDMI cable and Power cord from my HD Projector installed in the ceiling . The wiremold is easy to cut with a hacksaw and the connection pieces make it look good . It is a snug fit for both cables , so I could n't fit more in it . I used the adhesive back which works fine for me even though someone said it could damage the wall when you try to remove it . I plan on painting the wiremold later .
5 #### Hope to get it earlier , no more worry about garage floor !
5 #### Same strings that come on my guitar when it was new .
5 #### I just got finished writing a review on one of my digital cameras . I have gone thru several digital cameras in the past few years . I had a $ 400 Nikon camera which decided to break on me 1 month after the 1 yr warranty . I had a Sony Cybershot ( forgot which one ) which lasted at least 2 yrs . But the new ones are not even close to the quality of the old ones . A Canon Powershot A530 - which got great reviews ... but has a CONSTANT battery low blinking .. That only lasted 5 months . Lastly , a DXG ( Kyocera ) CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP $ 50 dig camera . STAY AWAY ! Bottom line . After owning those digital cameras while owning this Minolta . I will never go back to a digital camera again . This truly is the best camera I have ever had . You wo n't find a better camera that takes such great pictures . Especially the up close shots ! Hands down , WORTH buying one . Even used . I got my USED one on ebay about 4 - 5 yrs ago . and it still works great - never a problem !
5 #### Arrived promptly ... Ernie Ball banjo strings at a reasonable price . What more could you ask ? Does n't get any better than this .
5 #### el producto es igual a la foto y estaba bien empaquetado y llego a venezuela en excelente estado gracias sigan asi
5 #### The BT connection to my LG Envy Touch , and my BT capable IPOD is perfect ( both coexist peacefully together ) , so the wired connection to anything I have is great . FYI , the AC adapter makes a big difference in the sound quality and volume . On batteries ( 4 AA ) the BT connection will disconnect if you have the unit too loud , not so with the AC adapter plugged in , the sound ( and connection)is great on AC . The real issue is the sound , from such a little speaker it 's just amazing ! Just buy it , I think you 'll love it , in all , a really great product . Good job Motorola / JBL !
5 #### For years , I 've stood by the Evans G2 heads ! These are a great product . They 're very durable , and they produce a warmer tone , with a bit more attack than clear heads . With the proper tuning , they sound great on just about any kit , for any type of music . I would n't put any other head on my kit !
5 #### very good capo , is no aggressive with the neck and works is supposed .
5 #### This is a great product . No issues with use at all . I would purchase again if needed .
1 #### I never could get this to work right no matter what I did . It was n't even worth my time or money to send it back . I was excited to try this on my mom 's phone but it was more of a waste of time than it was worth .
5 #### Owned it for over a year , works without flaws . Simply plug in your stuff and it works . If you 're looking for a ethernet switch , then you 've found it .
5 #### Wow do I love this system ! This kit seems to have superseded older part numbers and it was a bit confusing as to whether this is what I needed . It worked perfectly with the A size resin and hardner ( there 's an extra pump ) . The kit comes with a set of tubes that you swap out according to the directions . Once installed , I 'm under the impression that there 's no need to clean out the pumps and close the cans , from what I 've read about other woodworkers ' experience . Sweet !
1 #### Do n't buy these . My friend got some and they messed his VCR up . He had to work on it , time and time again . They wo n't record . They stop in middle of recording and shut off . My friend worked on TV etc for a living and he knows it 's the tapes . Poor quality . Do n't waste your money .
5 #### easy to use and cut to size . would buy again
4 #### Not reversable , you have to open up to get it to work with some devices . Yamaha flips the polarity .
4 #### it works well . but priced way high . HomeDepot has a similar shaped one made by SuperStrut for SuperStrut channel . That one costs $ 3.50 . Of course , HomeDepot one is 1/8 " slightly smaller ( not fitting 2 " hitch ) and made of steel .
4 #### I needed something to share the DSL connection between two computers in separate rooms . I already had holes in the walls for a network connection with a crossover cable and had network cards installed , so I did n't need a wireless router and receivers . I decided on getting this one due to being familiar with the company 's cable modem . Setting up the computers with the router was simple with the help of the CD installation program . The router automatically treated the crossover cable as a regular ethernet cable which saved me another trip to the store . Updating the firmware was also easy to do and no problems came out of that . A few weeks later , the Linksys router kept resetting itself every 15 minutes every time I had torrent connections going . Through some online searching , I found out that my DSL modem had a built - in router as well and there was some conflict with the Linksys router . After switching off most of the auto - detect options and manually entering in most of the connection settings on both the DSL modem and Linksys router , the router was rock - solid again . As long as the firmware is up to date and there are no conflicts between the modem and router , it should work without problems .
4 #### Better then not having one . Better for WiFi not much improvement for my phone . At&t
5 #### nice pattern . I prefer a 2 " strap , and this one looks great .
5 #### This particular design is working out perfectly . It 's bright , but because the light source is located on a surface a bit larger than the bulb , it does n't bleed glare over and in to my eyes . The fold - up clip has been most functional for me as a stand so that I can set it standing on it 's side , directed toward my Kindle while lying on my side to read . It 's small , light - weight and compact , so it 's great for travel too . I looked at a lot of other designs , and tried a few . This one is by far the best design for my needs . I was hoping for something not quite so bright because I do n't like the idea of diminishing my melatonin production right before I go to sleep . But since I can use it free - standing on my mattress , I can place it far enough away from my Kindle that it is n't overly bright .
5 #### So far so good I use it for my 1990 's GK 400RB bass amp . Works like a charm .
5 #### Great price . I 'll probably never use it all , but it was cheaper than buying the amount I thought I would need at Best Buy . I does lie flat underneath the rugs we have in the living room .
2 #### You get what you pay for , very cheap quality . It funnels well though ... if that 's what you 're into
4 #### The sound quality is not quite clear enough for a 5 - star rating , but it 's not bad , and this unit has some nice features . It pairs easily , and can pair with two devices -- I only have one phone , but I could use this with my PS3 as well . It 's comfortable on my ear and with the large rubber hook ( which is n't as annoying to wear as it looks ) does n't feel like it 's going to fall off . I like the clear voice this uses to announce things like " Power On " and " Battery is Low . " So many devices sound the same , but this one 's identifiable . Maybe it 's just me , but sometimes I 'm not sure if my phone or my bluetooth car speaker is telling me it needs a charge ! I 've heard better and I 've heard worse -- basically this is a straightforward unit that does what it 's supposed to at a reasonable price point . Unless you need something especially fancy , it 'll do the job .
5 #### Not only did it come with the headset but it came with the iPod adapter as well . Only words of advise . If u like the smaller ear buds vs the larger ones . Super glue them in because I have tried to find extra replacement ones and I can not . Motorola has sent me 3 replacement bags and they all came with 4 of the large earbuds . Do not lose the small earbuds .
5 #### This Capo is inexpensive and works well . Clips on easily and hold strings down nicely . What more can I say . Got ta keep it simple on this review because it 's a simple item . Simply , it does what it 's supposed to do for a low price . I think it will last a while too but I 'll probable misplace it before it breaks anyway so I have a few of these floating around . You should have one of these in each gig bag .
5 #### just recieved and it works well with my 8120 however this phone is n't used anymore on my house .... but anyways its a great item to a 8120 user
3 #### While versatile , this fell off my windshield three times in the first day , sometimes with nothing in it and while stationary . Additionally , the slightest vibration makes the thing bounce all over the place making it difficult to follow navigation . My solution was to lower the mount so the device holder was resting on my dashboard . Kills some versatility but it keeps the phone stable and it has n't fallen off since .
5 #### I love heavy picks for the warm attack on the strings , and these tortex pick seem to have just enough of a texture to keep them from slipping around in my fingers .
5 #### El articulo perfecto . Me gusto bastante . Lo recomiendo 100 % . Es de buena calidad . Si volvera a comprarle a este vendedor .
5 #### Keeps my black SUV clean between washes . Once its broken in works GREAT ! I keep it in the trunk for fast dust offs .
5 #### I have been fortunate to build a small , but decent collection of acoustic and electric guitars in a room dedicated to music . All 15 of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the 15 years I 've been using String Swings I 've never had a problem with them . They hold every guitar , regardless of neck shape or style . Since they swivel , my Fender necks are just as secure as my Gibson necks . The depth is adjustable , so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics . While I never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my Nitro coated guitars , I did n't want to take a chance , so I use self - adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar 's finish . I try and screw them into studs to support the weight , and where I ca n't do it , I hang some of my lighter guitars , but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure ... although I sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw - in anchors ; but made out of metal - just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens . I also strongly recommend ( as others have done ) that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars ( 40 - 50 % humidity is perfect ) . I recommend the Honeywell&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Honeywell - HCM-6009 - QuietCare-9 - Gallon - Output - Console - Humidifier - with - Air - Washing - Technology / dp / B000G0LDRI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Honeywell HCM-6009 QuietCare 9 - Gallon Output Console Humidifier with Air Washing Technology</a >
3 #### I got this for my son , and even though he is tall for his age ( about 4'11 " ) , this is a very long strap . I shortened it all the way up for him and it is still 38 " from hole to hole , which is a bit long for him still . It is ok for an adult but too long for him to use comfortably . Other than that I would say it is good quality for the money , the holes are tight and it feels strong .
1 #### I received it in an open plastic casing with no labels , the seller said this is the way DLO packages their products . The leather quality is good and the craft is fine , but there are ' Fatal ' design flaws : 1 ) The Clip is SOOOO hard , you you to really struggle to snap it on your belt . 2 ) Only the upper part of the clip is fixed to the case body , which makes the clips very fragile and very annoying and difficult to put it on . ' This is alone a deal breaker ' 3 ) It has ' velcro ' to close the case , which is not convenient at all , and I need to press it a couple of time to ensure it is fully closed . 4 ) if you have a protective case on top of your iphone , it will barely fit . Seriously , avoid it . I tried the " BlueHarbor Horizontal Leather Case with Belt Clip for Apple iPhone 3 G & 3GS " and I 'm 100 % satisfied . Good luck .. MIT
4 #### Ca n't beat it for the money . Bought for kid 's practice piano and everyone knows how rough kids can be with headphones .
2 #### I am a bit disappointed this product is not made to fit a bass drum of most common lengths as I prefer it to touch BOTH heads to limit overtone ringing . This one was a bit short in length . Be sure to look up its fit dimension before ordering .
1 #### Worst strings I have ever used . I put these on a high quality Taylor and the sound was all midrange . No full sounds , no brightness , no projection . I am returning to D"Addarios . These strings sounds worse than completely dead strings .
5 #### Amazing sound quality for the price . It 's hard to beat even at a much higher price .
4 #### It 's clear , feels good on the ear . Very good Battery life . The only thing I do n't like about it is it wo n't play music . Only connects with the phone .
3 #### The only problem I have with these lights is that every 4 months one of the bulbs burns out . I never touch the bulb itself when I am installing them .
5 #### I 've been using the Absorber for over 15 years and I still have n't found a better chamois .
5 #### I ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks . They have a very comfortable feel and great sound !
4 #### I really like this bluetooth which I bought to replace my older Motorola model . I have no issue with static or echo 's and I use it while driving 4hrs round trip for work .
5 #### This is going to last forever . I barely use any of this stuff when I clean my K&N air filter for my Camry . Glad I bought the spray version versus cheaper pour - out version .
1 #### The directions for this product say that you should " shake it " . The product could not be mixed . Clear liquid and a lump of white goo . I even tried to mix it with the mixer part for my electric drill . No luck . Very disappointed in this product . I do n't know if it was old stock , had been frozen or what . Did n't work for me .
5 #### I purchased this product to replace my leather chamois . This is far superior and absorbs a lot more water . It is also more durable than the leather one . I will never go back to a leather chamois now that I have used this product .
2 #### works fine , but I gave it 2 stars because These locks are way over priced for what they are .
5 #### I just bought a 6 pack of these picks . All i got to say is that they are probably the most compfortable pick I 've ever used !
5 #### I love this product for doing automatic transmission fluid exchange on my Silverado . It does n't have a drain plug so instead of dropping the pan ( which is really difficult ) I suck the fluid out of the dip stick tube . This product works perfect !
1 #### The battery does not charge the phone properly . I t takes like 5 hours to charge . The cell phone drops the battery charge after one hour of use . The battery is very weak . Mr. R.
5 #### Was n't sure if these would meet my goals but they come 90 % to what I 'd hoped for . They are comfortable to wear , the cords have n't caught on anything yet ( like ipod buds will ) and once I got the right size ends they sealed out the outside sound to a large degree and gave greater volume . I have old timers tinnitus and high freq hearing loss so can not comment on fidelity but they are quite good for me . buds are small enough and fit well into my hear holes that I can get my motorcycle helmet on and off with these in place without disturbing them ! They are n't overly loud but loud enough to allow me to hear pavement engine and some traffic noise with the music turned up . Controls are easy for non - throttle hand to find and use once I figured out which button does what . Paired with my iPhone 6 quickly , and the only lack is a ' back ' button to replay a song if you would want or a skip forward and back a bit to rehear an audiobook passage . I 've already recommended these to others so I guess I like them that well and at $ 35 they 're a steal !
1 #### I have never been more angry at a product in my life , I can not believe that motorola actually put their name on this absolute peice of garbage . they will work for a very short time then will die , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .
4 #### Nice looking and functional case . Only disappointment was that that it closes with a snap as opposed to a magnet . Not sure if I missed that in the description .
5 #### Had this lens for a number of months - really great . This is not a heavy neck breaker . It is super fast to focus and the sharpest of all my Canon 's - even better then the 85 mm L. Have done some shockingly good flower work and also been amused by what you can get with insects that I had never seen before . Highly recommended and I consider cheap for the quality and flexibility .
5 #### These make great backup lights for a trailer hitch . Flip these babies on and you can see what you are doing .
5 #### As a musician , years ago I discovered Elixir . Elixir taught me there truly is a difference in guitar strings . I have played on Elixir strings ever since .
3 #### It does the job I guess we will have to see how long it lasts . It was a good product for the price .
4 #### I purchased these strings to freshen up my old Yamaha acoustic guitar , it worked . My old guitar sounds almost as smooth as the rest of my collection of guitars .
3 #### I bought this battery as a backup for my Sony HX5V for a trip to Europe last summer . I used this battery and the OEM battery extensively , and the Sony battery had a MUCH longer battery life . I could average over 400 pictures and a few short videos on the Sony battery , and only about 150 - 200 pictures on this one . The GPS was engaged with both batteries . If you need a cheap , emergency backup battery , then this product will suffice . If you want a true replacement for the Sony , then just buy the OEM .
5 #### exactly what I needed for my 1998 civic hatchback , plugged right in to the stock wiring harness . I used it with a " Metra 99 - 7891 Dash Kit For Honda Civic 96 - 98 " .
5 #### Great cable . Does its job and high quality . Using this for two years , I have never had a print fail because of it . Buy with confidence .
3 #### Not a great kit but manages to fill the gap in the panel . The plastics are hard and brittle , evident by the front bracket that was cracked along the edges . The tolerances were off by a significant margin and I had to saw and grind the dash behind the OEM face plate on my Miata to make it fit into the dash . Instruction manual is n't great and you have to physically cut off unused mounting points in order to assemble this plastic contraption . Done carefully , the kit looks great once everything is reassembled . Downsides are the poor quality plastics and the tedious trimming , assembly and grinding to make everything fit . Since this is practically the only kit available for a 91 Miata , you really have to make the best of it .
5 #### I use this stuff on my spa cover and it works well . Follow up with 303 Aerospace Protectant for a great low - gloss protective shine . Have n't tried it yet on a Tonneau because what the hell is a Tonneau ? Is that some type of French word ? This is ' Merica and we do n't need no French words ! If you mean to say " truck bed cover " then say , " truck bed cover " or better yet " tarp " ! Fancy pants people ' round here ... "tonneau" ... 'bout made me choke on my croissant when I saw that .
5 #### It do what it do the way it should . It shoves them 0 's and 1 's back and fourth .
1 #### Fit in the car but the radio wo n't fix in the opening
5 #### LOVE THIS PRODUCT . MUCH EASIER TO USE UNSTEAD OF CHANGING INTERNAL BATTERIES ALL THE TIME . USE IT QUIT OFTEN DROID 2 GLOBAL . HAVE CHARGED UP PHONE 4 TIMES AND ALL LIGHTS STILL LIT . VERY QUICK . LOVE ALL DIFFERENT ATTACHMENTS . CHARGE MY I PAD AS WELL .
5 #### This micro SD card works great . I bought this card for my champagne 64 GB Asus Prime . But I still did n't have it on hands so I used it on My MetroPCS Lg Esteem android phone and it worked . 3 day ago I received my Asus prime . Inserted the card in and boommmm , now I have close to 120 GB on my tablet . Load card with MKV movies and music . Movies play directly from the micro card . Good quality card . Movies are perfect on the tablet .
3 #### Ordered 2 pairs from Amazon Warehouse Deals and one side failed on each pair . I have owned Koss before and these were returned to Amazon by someone else and I also returned them . 5 start for product and 1 star for Amazon Warehouse Deals
4 #### Works fine . Just what I wanted and better than bulky headset .
2 #### The phone seems very sturdy . It has a nice industrial design . The firmware is OK at best , and it takes more clicks to get anywhere than my kids ' nokia . That got it a star above 1 . The software that I had to buy separately was totally inadequate . First of all , it goes out to sync and downloads 30 MB 's of s / w and says its up to date , but it still wo n't sync . After reading their website , I download some more s / w to reinstall the drivers . NOTHING WORKS . I call them and they say that there 's a new version that works w/ this phone . I get it , and it does well w/ the calendar and contacts from MS Lookout , but is unable to work with the music . I have music in High resolution MP3s , but it ca n't read them . It ca n't read wmas , which sync really nice- I ca n't resize my MP3s to the smaller ones ( see nokias great s / w ) . All in all , it 's been about 12 hours and I 'm uploading some music that may or may not work , and takes entirely too much of the memory to hold it . Motorola , you 're an embarrassment .
5 #### This is a very tough and well built case highly recommended . I have had issues with clip cases because the clip always breaks and although you have to feed this one through your belt I know it will last .
5 #### I could not believe the price on this item compared to box stores . The larger size is excellent . Quite a find .
5 #### Great product for the great price . Hold great in cigarette lighter , it turns on nice blue light when is in use .
5 #### Fits my Hamilton Stand perfectly and leaves room for a small foot mounted tambourine . Has a strap making it easy to toss over my shoulder and makes my toting all my stuff in and out of gigs just a little bit easier .
5 #### I use this ethernet switch to power up my DVR system and my streaming box and it worked very well for me
3 #### It 's too big and bulky . After a while , the big part that goes behind your ears starts to break away . Otherwise ... GREAT sound quality ... but do n't buy it expecting it to last forever . It pairs with 2 phones simultaneously so that 's a good thing .
5 #### Excellent product . Used it on my Corvette soft top and it cleaned and water proofed it very well . You MUST cover your glass and painted surfaces before using the water repellant .
5 #### Product was as advertised and I received it in a timely manner . The 10 ft . length allowed me to place my new external drive more conveniently and seems to work quite well .
3 #### Good sound but I find them a little uncomfortable and a bit heavy .
4 #### This is my 2nd of these routers in the past 5 years . My first one was working fine until I decided to go through the firmware upgrade process . Following the directions laid out by Linksys , the firmware update ended up making my router unusable . I called tech support and after waiting forever , the tech basically told me it was unfixable and I 'd have to go buy another one . He never really asked me too many questions and just seemed interested in getting me off the phone and in the store to buy another one . I ended up having that first one for 2 years . So I go purchase another one and have been using it for going on 3 years roughly . It works great , easy to setup and gives me lots of home network expandability . I 'm not a computer guru so I ca n't comment on it 's technical aspects but I 've never had any problems that were interent , home network or virus related with this product .
5 #### The most common keys for blues harps do n't include the Low F key , so any five , seven or twelve harp set do not have it , which is a shame , as the tone is perfect for the grungy tones of slow blues , or the up beat folk tunes with whistles and violins .. Straight from the box this beauty bends the notes easily , both draw and blow . They are not the cheapest of the 10 Hole harps , but it seems like they are the best - I have yet to find another brand I like as much .
5 #### Used on my 4 wheeler to re - cover old foil . Perfect amount for my 06 Polaris Sportsman 800 . Enough to cover all of the places that they had factory foil . Quick shipment . Good product .
4 #### It 's a plain jane guitar strap at a great price and holds my guitar in place . It 's not the most comfortable or the most fancy , but it does the job just fine .
1 #### You can usually rely on Amazon customer reviews to steer you right . Not this case with this thing . It sounds absolutely terrible ( distorted , weak and tinny ) . Steer clear . This is garbage .
5 #### I 've been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding . It provides a terrific slick feel to the fretboard and makes playing much easier and more enjoyable . Clean , no residue from repeated use , and the glide across the strings is super nice . I use it regularly on my USA Stratocaster maple neck and would n't leave home without it .
5 #### just a smoke show when used through the vacuum lines works a lot better in the fuel or oil
3 #### I bought this to split my bass signal ( high EQ / low EQ)for a King 's X dUg Pinnick sound . What I did n't realize is that I needed to go an octave UP and this is rightfully an OCT-1 and -2 respectively . I tried to tweak as much as I could ( I put this on my higher EQ'd signal split ) , but did n't get what I wanted . Additionally , when I used both outputs ( direct and processed ) the combined sounds were synthesize - sounding and way off from what I needed . I opted , instead for the Joyo Octaver / Fuzz which worked perfectly for me . I would think this would just work better for a guitar . Bass gets complicated when you 're messing with octaves ( especially DOWN octaves ) .
5 #### Using the cable from day 1 once i got it , Galaxy S captivate charging just fine :) . I am using it from the USB port of keyboard and wall socket . Both works fine .
4 #### I purchased Plantronics 665 headset to replace BlackBerry 655 + by Plantronics that went through washing machine ( but surprisingly still worked fine after drying ) . My wife also has one of these and she loves it . I like 665 as much as I like 655 + . The fit is comfortable and secure with the ear loop . The sound quality is good on both ends . The battery life is sufficient for me I charge it once every two - three days . The only complaing is that the buttons are a bit hard to press . When I push the main button the ear tip gets pushed into my ear which is not very pleasant . Overall , this is a great headset at a good price .
5 #### works perfect for a hands free car solution . . . . magnet very strong . . . i have it attached to my phone case .
5 #### This is a must have for any guitar / bass player that uses single coil pickups . It wipes out that nasty 60cycle hum and at the very worst , minimizes it . The cost seems extreme for a ' ground lift ' but I 've used those typical 2.00 ground lift you can buy locally . If you 're a gigging musician and you play in so suspect places with power . Get this . Well worth the cost . Soundmen , this is a good product for you to carry .
5 #### it worked great for my 10 inch side snare , love the sound of it , you can not go wrong with this head
4 #### It was fine and I probably would have kept it but I sent the Bianchi duty belt back and this is mated to it so I returned it .
5 #### The ability to leave my MP3 music ( cell phone ) in my gym bag and get a serious workout without disruption is worth the price along . Being on call , it 's also important that I do n't miss any of those important phone calls . Getting interrupted with a voice announcement of who 's calling makes it all worthwhile . After the first use I was hooked . All of my weekday workouts are with my bluetooth stereo headset . As for the weekends , I 'm back to the Zune , not because I dislike the headphones , because I need to escape from the phone .
5 #### $ 5 , you ca n't go wrong . I just slid on a shoulder pad on it and it 's perfect for my bass .
5 #### This device works well on my HTC M7 . High quality product .
3 #### This extractor did it 's job , but it took FOREVER to extract 4 quarts of oil out of my Sea Doo
4 #### It 's ok if you just wanted to protect the phone . For the price , it a good buy . Easy to put together .
1 #### The mirror is cool but during the day it makes the screen harder to see .
5 #### These are typical Remo quality heads well suited to snare drum batter heads . On toms I typically prefer a two ply head for the batter side but on snares a single ply coated head works well . I bought a couple to have new ones around as needed .
1 #### It was awesome for the first few months . It sounded great and did n't seem too cheap . After about using it about 30 times over a period of 3 months the compressor broke . I have n't found a way to buy just the compressor so now everything I installed is worthless and just taking up space . This horn works great if you only want something to work for a one time use , but if you want something that will last I recommend trying to get a better quality horn .
4 #### Fits well , looks good , and does what it is designed to do .
4 #### This is a good case that stays on well . It is painted black , so if you scratch it , it will show white . Also , I 'm a little afraid of the belt clip . It does n't seem real durable and I 'm concerned I 'd break it off and lose my phone .
4 #### I have been playing all my life . Now that I have kids i 'm trying to teach them the right way . This Metrome helps keeps my 10yr.old interested and in time when playing the piano . It was sugested by his teacher and as long as he uses it I would think this simple device helps .
5 #### I could not believe the great price on the single wheel chock ! I bought 12 & bolted two each together to make them easier to be seen on the garage floor for a car stop . They were less than $ 4.00 each ! When shopping on Amazon , keep looking & in the midst of many items you will find what you are looking for @ the best price .
5 #### These might not last too long . Guessing they are n't fresh . But you get 5 , so who cares ?
5 #### First off , you will find yourself having to buy a new case every two months as the Velcro closure simply wears out . Other than that , This is a rugged case and has held up very well and I am rough on my Stuff , I recommend !
5 #### If you are handy and willing to take a chance that you can fix it , buy it and try it . There are many tips online that will help you fix almost anything .
4 #### Product arrived in AT&T packaging and appears to be identical to the last iFrogz we got from the AT&T store for $ 30 ! Would buy this product again . The two piece design makes it very easy to put on . * * * * UPDATE * * * * Sorry , had to knock off one star from the original 5 - star . We liked the case and went ahead and bought a 2nd case as a spare . No sooner after the 2nd case arrived , the bottom half of the 1st case quietly fell off somewhere ( yet to be found ) . I suspect that a few of these cases may be defective prompting AT&T to offload their inventory , and why there 's a boat load of them available here for cheap . Still an outstanding value nonetheless . As for the 2nd case , I put a small drop of superglue where the two parts come together ( being careful not to get any on the phone ) and the problem is solved .
2 #### I got these because I thought it would be nice to have brighter back up bulbs , but because they are blue they really darken the light housing and make it look well .... blue . More than I anticipated they would . Then I tried them in the red brake light side and even there it darkened it to a ruby red that looked funny because of the blue color . They are nice and bright when working , but unless your looking for a blue lens housing look , stick with a clear / amber / chrome bulb . Also , pretty pricy for a small simple bulb .
5 #### This is my second EJ-200 ; I had an early model , made in Korea , which I bought in ' 98 , without electronics or a cutaway and with a laminated top . These newer ones have a solid spruce top and that makes all the difference in the world , in terms of tone . The looks of the guitar are superb , as an Elvis fan , it reminds me of the movie , " Loving You " in which Elvis had the Gibson version . I use my EJ for recording back up tracks for my mandolin . When I listen to the playback , I am very pleased with the tone of this guitar . Of note , it has not one , but two pickups ; one under the bridge and the other at the end of the fingerboard ( nanomag and nanoflex ) which allows you to plug into two different amps each with different setups . That makes it special . A great value . Recommended !
1 #### You get what you pay for and the price is very cheap ! I am sending this back at a loss to me just to get it out of my sight . The Stagg Table Top is a far better table top stand and for only a few bucks more .
5 #### This in - line volume control can be used in several situations . As a wearable , it has a clip ( like on a pen ) so you can attach it to a pocket , sleeve or collar so it wo n't be flopping around like a cord mounted control . In my case I used a small piece of double sided tape to inconspicuously mount it to the side of a table next to my chair to control the volume of the earbuds I wear while watching TV . The volume control range is from full off to full on and there is no static when operating the control and no distortion in sound quality at any setting . My only very minor complaint is that the control wheel is a bit too recessed so you have to only use the tip of your finger . That 's probably a plus if you 're wearing it as it 's less likely to be moved by just brushing against it . It 's well worth the price and I would buy it again
4 #### even though it 's not actually rubber . I thought it was going to be like a body glove or something . but nonetheless I still like the case .
5 #### I have had Haynes shop manuals before . They are good reference material . The photos are very helpful . Will get one for my next car .
4 #### Very nice guitar cables from CALIFORNIA CABLES ! Bright red shows up on stage . No noise cables . Lifetime warranty . 18 feet long . They are made very well and should last for quite a while . Thanks guys ! Get yours now at a great price . Get a couple for the musicians in your life for Christmas ! HO ! HO ! HO !
5 #### After 7 years , my headlights started to get a cloudy hazed . I purchased this cause of the reviews and seeing it on you tube . Could n't have n't been better . Very easy to use , highly recommend it .
5 #### Love option to have 2nd USB since EVERYTHING these days is USB . Works fine even though aftermarket for charging the iphone and iproducts
5 #### The case was a Christmas gift for my neice and she was very surprised and happy . I was very satisfied w / my purchase and the case was exactly what I wanted . I will definitely be back . I love Amazon its the best !
5 #### Got a big phone that needs a big case that 's not too bulky .. This did the job . Buy it ! !
4 #### This is a good case , but I decided to return it because of the limited space for mutes and accessories . My son is the trumpet player . We recently upgraded his trumpet to a used Conn Vintage One from a famous local music store in Silver Spring , MD . ( The horn is apparently one of the earliest Vintage One 's made by Conn and it seems like a super horn to me , though I mainly play trombone ) . The Vintage One came with a large Conn double case , which my seventh - grader does not need . I tried the Vintage One in a Protec hard case from the same store and it fit perfectly , and the case has some room in the outside fabric cover for a mute or two , so I bought that case and returned the Gator case to Amazon . But the Protec cost more than double this Gator case , so the Gator may be a better choice for many players , especially if they carry mutes in a separate case or do not need to use mutes .
5 #### Best vinyl cleaner and conditioner . I have been using it for 22 years and my vinyl has never looked better ! ! !
5 #### Fits the tire snuggly , but it provides a great accent to the vehicle . It seems durable enough to last for a few years .
1 #### This drive was not recognizable by either a Windows 7 PC or a Windows 8 tablet . Got similar item ( $ 5 more ) from Microcenter and it was plug and play .
2 #### Good sound . Love the on board controls . Pairs easily . But having trouble charging . Its defective . Others having same problems . Buy it if you do n't mine rigging it up to charge .
5 #### Bought it for a 10 - year - old filter ; after I used up my first kit . I clean my filter pretty frequently , but this is still a 10 year supply . Ignoring any performance gains , the K&N system has saved me a ton on throw - away filters .
5 #### Very sturdy piece , mechanic quality . Works well ... I have one now sitting around for sale if interested , as I no longer own a Honda .. ;-)
5 #### I tried a bunch of wah wahs ( Morley , Vox , etc . ) including the top Dunlop model and they were real noisy and did n't like my pedalboard at all in series . This is the original and the simplest & best one I ever had . Relatively quiet and my pedalboard just loves it . Good value and good product . I wish the off - on stomp switch was easier to activate . I find it difficut to turn it on and off . It is n't any different than the others I 've tried , but you really have to step on it hard to click it most times . Maybe there s a way to adjust the switch pressure under the expression pedal . I guess they felt like most people will be turning it on and off while they are using it . Cheers Abz
5 #### Great resonator strings ! You get what you pay for and I paid more for better strings and got just that , better strings !
5 #### great product . second one i 've had and no problems . good battery life and quick to recharge . this is a good product that works
5 #### Love the sound quality ... better than more expensive models . Hard to believe based on price . Very compact , easy to mount .
2 #### Would not recommend for all guitars . Hard to get on a lot of strap holders because the leather is so thick . Also , extremely squeaky on the surface of my guitar . I do not like mine .
5 #### Good little mud flaps . Makes the truck a little more mine .
5 #### been using liquid glass products for 26 years ... They all work as advertised
5 #### seems well made , comes with O ring , and it has worked well with my pump and gauge set
1 #### No output power ? I think you can reach a trucker within a 100 yards . Pass and buy a radio with clearly posted output power wattage . A set of $ 50 Motorola radios are more powerful .
5 #### It 's a simple remote control shutter switch . The purpose of this item is so you can take pictures with long exposure times without having the camera shake upon releasing the normal shutter button on your camera . It is not meant to be used as a remote switch for group portraits where the photographer wants to take the picture and be in the picture as well . If that is your purpose , then you need to buy the wireless remote control instead . Having this attached to your tripod - mounted camera makes you look much more like a professional photographer :)
1 #### I bought this a couple of months ago and it already quit working . It felt heavy duty when I first got it and thought it would be great to power my iPhone . It burnt out and i took it apart . When i got it apart i found lead weights hot glued into it to make it feel heavy . Too funny that Chinese ingenuity . The part is junk .
3 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . I do wish it were a little larger though . Easy to install and it works .
5 #### A must have for nature shots ! Works very well , and in conjunction with Steren 12 feet 2.5 mm Male To 2.5 mm Female Extension Cable - Stereo , ( I use 2 ) lets you stay a comfortable distance from the camera and critters . Set up your camera close to where you might think your birds or whatever are going to be . Watch from inconspicuous place ( e.g. , patio ) and when ready , fire away !
4 #### This lock is very easy to use . the only two things you need to carry around are the key and the cable itself . Tie your laptop up wherever you go , especially the library ! I live on the ground floor , and my desk is right next to the window . So I keep my laptop locked up even when it 's at home , so that any would - be burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook . Although , if he really wanted to , he could probably get a pair of wirecutters powerful enough to cut the cable . All in all , this cable makes me feel secure against casual thieves and I recommend it for all laptop users .
4 #### This product seems to work OK . I distributes the weight well ( takes it off of your neck . ) I wish that would have a metal hook on it , though . The plastic hook makes me a tad bit nervous . Other than that , it seems like a good product .
5 #### Works great for a cheap mount . Worked great on a 32 " Emerson LCD tv . Does everything as advertised ! Can tighten or loosen joints for easier movement .
5 #### I bought this for two reasons , to practice my double bass without driving my family crazy , and to take on vacation so I can continue to practice while we are on vacation . This thing is made solid and is large enough for a double pedal . The feel is excellent and after practicing every day for a week , I was able to increase my foot speed and control and it transferred right over to my drum kit . This is a nice practice pad and I would recommend it to anyone who may need something to practice on .
5 #### This is an absolute must if you 're not in to washing your car every few days ! It pulls dust off like some sort of black magic . -I'm convinced that it 's made by wizards .
4 #### I 've been using Flitz off and on for several years to clean and polish small brass instrument parts . Sometime I wander away from it and try other polishes and cleaners , but I always come back to Flitz and I have n't found anything that 's better . It does a very good job in getting rid of tarnish spots in brass and that 's my main use for it . It does take some elbow grease and maybe a second application for deep tarnish spots but it works better than other polishers / cleaners for this particular purpose . I 've tried using it as recommended for plastic and Bakelite and it does a good job but I prefer&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Novus - plastic - polish / dp / B002UCYRZU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Novus plastic polish</a>&nbsp;for those materials .
5 #### easy to cut / file , eases the string tension and when whammying or tuning , also helps sustain , just a bit .
5 #### This fuzzy 12 space rack is great . It 's so great that I bought another one for the extra gear I wound up not being able to fit into just one . The rack rails have an indicator at each rack unit height , so it 's easy to leave multiple spaces blank while you 're laying it out .
5 #### A plug is a plug is a plug but not all extensions are designed and engineered the same . Nice colors . Very easy to insert plugs . Long cord . Can attach many devices with no worry . Well designed and a very reasonable price . Not using it for A / V system but sure it is fine with that .
5 #### Unit helps between equipment with ground loops on the same circuit . Does not help for equipment on different legs of a three phase power source .
5 #### these are great , stick them to your music stand , or right to your guitar
3 #### It did a moderate job of pushing the grease into the bearing . But it did n't seem to thoroughly fill every void within the bearing . I still had to manually pack some grease into the outer perimeter of the bearing . If purchasing again , next time I would probably choose another style bearing packer .
5 #### This thing is great ! It has helped me change the 14 heads on my drum set ! It would have taken twice the time if I had used a regular key ! I recommend this drum key to all !
5 #### I love my Nook Book . I bought several nook books and I am please with it . It is easy to buy books with it .. Try it you will not be sorry .
5 #### This actually did great on the carpet in my car , I tried other products prior to using this but this did a fantastic job .
5 #### After reading on the AC / DC website that these are the strings of preference by Angus Young for use on his Gibson SG I thought I 'd give them a try . I took my 2009 Gibson SG Standard into my local Guitar Center Tech . He mounted them , lowered the back Humbucker a bit adjusted the action etc . , and now my guitar plays better then any guitar I 've ever had . It sound bright and clear and the resonance is much better .
4 #### This is my first pick purchase , as I am learning to play . They seem OK to me , thus far . I purchased a " medium " size , but I have large fingers , and think I will purchase some " heavy " size to see the difference . The economics appear good as far as the quantity / price goes . I never saw the quantity listed , so I counted and came up with " 72 " picks in this package . So , it looks like a " Good Buy " . JTB
5 #### These are my favorite pick right now . They feel especially good when new . Once they 're used a bit , the edges tend to sharpen a lot , and the sides get pretty slick .
1 #### I do n't like this product at all only had for about 2 weeks and it 's not working anymore so do n't buy this product not good at all .
5 #### I got these to clean dirty DVD and Bluerays that I got from Netflix . Works great . Saves a lot of frustration when a movie stops or skips because of crud on the disk .
3 #### These are n't bad if you just need to connect , but the price does show up in the quality . If the money is n't so tight , spring for something a little nicer .
5 #### I gave it to my brother and he loved it .
5 #### I use a bunch of cable ties when building a computer . They help me to create wiring bundles and minimize the cluttered look inside of a computer case . Doing this helps improve the air flow and helps the computer case to operate cooler . It also makes the job look professional and clean . I also use these outside and I like the UV resistant cable ties and they do n't degrade from sunlight . I use a lot of the 8 " size and they come 100 per bag so they are a good buy . I recommend them for your next project !
5 #### With TPU cases it 's usually a hit or miss . With this one , my Nexus 7 is a happy tablet . The back area has a flat , slick , X area while most of the sides retain a textured area that works very well when holding in your hand . I often surf the web or watch videos while in bed and have had no problems with the case being slippy . For the money this is a great case and probably the best you will get under $ 10 .
4 #### It 's a good strap . It 's a plain , simple black polyester - type strap . I have a similar one on my Strat . There are definitely way higher quality straps out there but you do n't need to worry about it breaking or anything . I use it on my Tele which is my heaviest guitar with no issue . I chose this one because I like to add pins I find to it . Every show or open mic I play , I always get some random band 's pin and I stick it somewhere on the strap . They add character to it and remind me of my musical adventures . If you 're not like me and want some more heavy duty then go for a leather strap .
3 #### I initially bought a Mounting Dream mount , which was very solid and easy to install , but only had a 15 " extension . I needed a 24 " extension for a very tight corner , so I bought this one , but it does n't seem quite as solid as the Mounting Dream mounts . Still , it gets the job done .
5 #### This is the best headset for truckers . The back ground noise can not be heard from caller . The ear pices is just the right volume . the Mice takes some use to it . When you talk , you talk in a normal voice . and do n't have to speak up to be heard . If you put the mice at your mouth , it will distort the sound . The best place just below your lower lip . The paring has to be done every time to turn the headset on . Will not automatic paring at turn on . Good thing its easy do to . The charge time is great and really holds the charge in stand - by and talk time . the only thing I do n't like its heavy and sometimes the mice gets caught on the shoulder strap , when looking side to side .
1 #### I checked around Amazon as well as some other sites , and decided these were what I needed . I read the reviews , looked at the pictures and bought two of these . I received them today . I unpacked one of them , read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for Amazon . These mounts are very , very heavy and require 6 , yes SIX , screws to mount to the wall . Are you kidding me ? The TVs are only 22 lbs ! Two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary . What a joke ! And Lag bolts ? Ever heard of screws ? The other issue is that these are very hard to move . I bought an articulating wall mount for a reason , and I expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my hand .
5 #### Dropped my phone so many times and have 0 scratches on it . This thing works wonderfully ! Would purchase again no questions asked .
4 #### I liked this phone because the battery life was excellent . Other than that the phone has no real value other than making or receiving phone calls . We had the phone on AT&T and it was for a 11 year old . Simply by plugging in the sim card it was working . No set up required . The phone could be used to send or receive texts but because the screen is basically a calculator , it was not pleasant and the kid did n't use it at all . She lost the phone once and it was easily replaced without costing us more than re - purchasing it from Amazon . Going to ATT for a new sim card was all that was required . The phone does not do call waiting , if you are on the line you will get a busy signal when someone else calls . You will get about 5 hours of talk time and about 1 week of standby time . The contacts are saved to the sim card , not the phone , so if you upgrade to a new phone you take all your contacts with you . If you change the sim card , you lose all your texts and contacts . I would purchase this phone again if for nothing else , the price and battery . Those with high expectations of getting more than a basic feature phone your aiming too high .
4 #### In the past I have had contract phones with monthly charges , cancellation fee etc . For me that was not worth it as I only need the phone for infrequent use . I have had two tracfone ( C139 ) for a few months now . I am perfectly happy with them . Each Tracfone only cost $ 20 , and that will also include free minutes ... 10 with the phone ... 10 if your activate online ... and 120 if you allow me to refer you ... we both will get 120 free minutes . I also have 2 additonal codes for 30 and 60 more free bonus minutes . The service will last 2 months when first you activate , and 2 more months when you add the free minutes . After that point if you have not used up all your minutes you can roll over your unused minutes when you buy more minutes ... for as little as $ 20 every 60 days . If you decide your do n't need the service after you have used up the time and minutes ... store you phone and reactivate it at a future time ... no fee ... just buy as little as $ 20 for 60 minutes ... however , you will be assigned a different phone number , which I do n't think is a big deal . Contact me ( matman713 at hotmail dot com ) for my referral and get started with a bunch of free minutes !
4 #### So far it seems great sensitivity wise and the on off switch is very convenient .
5 #### Its now where we needed it -- on our new spare tire .
5 #### After reading some of the negative reviews I think I understand what the problem is . If you purchased the product from Amazon you did n't have the benefit of reading the back label . The back label indicates which product to use for various oxidation levels . Light : PlastX cleaner and polish Moderate : One step headlight restoration kit Severe : Heavy duty headlight restoration kit The lenses on my 2007 Camry had a light haze forming . It was hazy enough to look bad but probably not enough to reduce night time light output . Most of the haze was from the top to the middle , probably because that 's where the sun hits the most . After reading about different products I decided to try the least expensive and easiest method first . I purchased PlastX and in about 20 minutes both lenses were clear again . I simply applied the product and rubbed it into the lens , and repeated in areas that required it . This product will not eliminate scratches or pitting . It will only eliminate a light haze . If you have anything more than a light haze you 'll probably need one of the wet sanding products and need to spend an hour or more on each lens to carefully remove the oxidation .
1 #### Kyocera Jax is a great phone , especially at the price . It 's small , compact , and slips into your shirt pocket . It has some great features for a phone of it 's size . If this phone is available with any other service I would recommend it without hesitation ! Virgin Mobile has the worst customer service , and coverage . When I needed it , I could n't get a signal . I lost 160 minutes of air time that I purchased , because I did n't have the money to add additional minutes . Nothing any worse than being a customer who is being told when to buy minutes for a phone . 200 minutes for $ 20 is n't a good deal either . How long does 200 minutes last if you actually use the phone ? It wo n't work for just emergencies , because you lose what minutes you do n't use if you ca n't afford to sign up for the auto roll over plan . If a person is looking for an emergency cell phone only . I recommend Tracfone , because they at least have some coverage !
2 #### DON'T CARE FOR IT . GAVE IT AS A GIFT AND THEY WERE OKAY WITH IT . JUST NOT WHAT I EXPECTED .
3 #### The item showed up and worked great . My only complaint is that Amazon listed the item as in - stock yet took 3 days to process and ship . I got the item a week later . I highly advise getting this item however , I advise going somewhere else to get it .
5 #### Honestly , it 's painful to play hunched over at this point in my life . The A - frame allows me to sit up comfortably like I 'm wearing a strap , but without the added weight on my shoulder . It 's pretty easily adjustable . I find myself using it on either leg ( classical style or traditional ) and it works either way pretty well , keeping me from bending . In the past , I 've had one of the cushion - style supports and they just are n't the same . You ca n't adjust them well enough to really use them to suit your specific needs , depending on your height , guitar etc . This is the one to get .
5 #### Awesome hitch cover . the one i got is made of all metal , but i can see how it could be confused as plastic . its made out of the pressed - type metal if that makes sense . where it is strong enough to stand up to the elements , but weak enough that given a decent amount of force it would break instead of bend . It was only $ 15 , so yeah . Color is good and the " S " is a type of brushed metal . Aluminum ? It comes with 2 sets of arms for different size hitches . each arm attaches to the " S " on the back by 2 screws each . sturdy enough . the arms may be aluminum as well . they are a little flexible . Which was a plus as it might not have fit in my 2014 ram crew cab stock receiver . its a snug fit . be sure to use a locking hitch pin to keep the thieves away .
5 #### Works great for hooking up my Android tablet to my Old stereo system and blast away those tracks . solid wires too .
5 #### totally restores and brings out the color , making your fabric look richer . it is 100 percent water repelllent and deflects rain .
1 #### All the photos were horribly blurry . I am not convinced this product is actually water proof . Spend a little more money and get a better one .
5 #### This headset is the best one I have had in many years of using headsets . The range of functions and extreme flexibility of options is very satisfying .
4 #### This is a very good headset in general . Pros : Sound : I can use it in my truck with the window down while driving and I still sound good to the other party . The noise canceling feature works very well . Battery Life : Quite good . I forget to charge it for days at a time and it still keeps on ticking . Comfort : I forget it 's there when wearing it . Cons : Sound : I wish the speaker was just a bit louder . It 's quite usable , but in really loud places it 's not so good . The Clip : The clip breaks easily . Also , it does not secure into my ear as well as I would like and once in a while falls out . Though , this is not a problem unless I 'm bending over or upside down .
5 #### I got it for one reason ... PRICE and it does the job . I am able to keep my phone charged while on the go .
5 #### This is exactly what I needed to lock my daughter 's suitcases when she goes to study abroad . The ties will lock her luggage , and when the TSA breaks open these ties , I wo n't be upset that they cut open expensive luggage locks . I was glad that these arrived so quickly . Thanks !
5 #### I was installing a spare tire on my boat trailer . It is stored at a storage area so I felt that I needed a lock on it and did not want to use a cable lock . These are easy to install and work great .
4 #### These are all plastic except for the two screws . The first two of these I ordered showed up broken in the box . Amazon immediately sent me two more and gave me a prepaid return label . After using them I ordered two more and those came without any problem .
5 #### My Samsung Infuse 4 G phone uses a Micro USB cable , so I purchased this " BlackBerry " cable for use at work , as it is the same type of cable . The cable fits and works with no problems , and for less than $ 2 , I purchased another one .
5 #### My son really like the sturrdyness of it and he really need one , so he picked this one and the price is fair .
5 #### have nt had chance to use the tapes in camcorder yet . I bet i will use this year welll i hope
1 #### Not real denim , this is more of a plastic type material . I have a Smittybuilt denim cover that I 'm comparing this to . This cover did fit a 35 baja claw with some finagling
4 #### Served it 's purpose , the packaging says it will only hold one cord . They are not kidding . Just enough room for the single cable wire .
5 #### This is a well designed minimalist type case that I would love to use except that It does n't quite fit my Nikon D80 with my favorite lens the 18 - 200 AF VR lens . It would work with any of the stock 18 - 55 or shorter lenses . The D40 works fine in this case too . It 's well made , too bad it is n't a couple of inches longer !
5 #### I have n't measured signal throughput so I ca n't comment on that . But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle . This thing simply will not crimp , will not kink up on itself , does not get twisted and has no tension in it . It 's the easiest handling cable I 've ever dealt with , a real pleasure when you 've got all kinds of wires running all over . It 's like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy , and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections . I have a 10 - footer with one right - angle connection , and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster .
3 #### Would not conform to curve surface of front bumper trim piece being covered .
5 #### Great horn , very loud and the pitch is good . Not a cheesy Japanese car horn , but something with a little backbone to it . Used on my boat .
5 #### It is as advertized . It clamps on to the tip of the antenna , the other end has a gaiter type clip to secure the other end .
1 #### After reading several reviews here about Amazons inability to deliver said product , I called to ask if was actually available for purchase . Immediatly afterwards , ALL negative Amazon reviews were gone ! Ca n't take the heat ? That 's what reviews are for !
5 #### I was looking for a solid state drive that I could carry around , had lots of space for large files and was bullet proof . This one fills the bill . Thanks ...
5 #### I have been using this power strip for quite some time now without a single issue .
5 #### I was having some problems with my Ego Compressor comp getting noisey , sent it back and found out that It Had been using a slightly drained battery , so I got one of these and it is great , nice and quiet again , half the price of the boss one .
5 #### We had purchased for my boat . so far it works great . Do nt know if it will hold up on a boat or not . Only time will tell .
5 #### THE BEST STRINGS , I have been using Elixir Polyweb strings since the 90 's and I have to set - up some friend 's guitars and they use a different string and it 's a big difference in sound , tone and feel .
5 #### I just begun to use all this phone can do . I can see why people can get hooked on a smart phone and this phone is so well built . So far I have ; Internet , music files , email , appointment scheduler , good quality call tone with T - Mobil ( No Contract)@ $ 55 a month , that s 500 minutes and unlimited data . GPS & Maps , video , games , wifi and more . I was able to sync my albums with windows media player , installing them into my music files , now I have the Grateful Dead playing Lost Sailor for my ring tone . Totally satisfied here .
5 #### Please do n't listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings would n't keep tune . They do n't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings . You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch . Like all instruments , the strings have to stretch , especially with nylons , so be patient . It only took me about half an hour . It clearly states STARTER pack , so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele , especially because of the price . These people just do not know how to read . It has a great sound , but the ' lightweight gig bag ' definitely is lightweight . If you want real protection , I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines . it is a great buy though , considering the price . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### ALSO A XMAS PRESENT & VERY FAVORABLE . I LOVE IT
5 #### I LOVE THIS FRIENDLY PENS . I CANT USE MY TABLET WITHOUT ONE OF THIS . A FINGER WORKS BUT NOT BETTER THAN THE PEN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GLARE THE Screen .
5 #### This thing is SO handy , and EASY to use . SO glad I decided to get this .
5 #### I never used to be a person that hung on my guitar on my wall , but I am now ! My wife got me this for Christmas and I absolutely love it . I screwed this into a stud on the wall just to be safe , since my acoustic guitars are valuable . I have two of these ( different colors to match the wood of the guitars ) , and they look fantastic . Everyone comments on how nice my guitars look on the wall the moment they walk in . The interesting thing about hanging them on the wall is that it encourages me to play more . The guitars are so accessible because they are hanging right in front of you , that I find myself playing a lot more than usual . The padding on the holder is a great feature , and this is extremely sturdy . 100 % recommended !
5 #### I love this clock . The stereo quality is really good . I wanted something soothing for my 7 month old to fall asleep to . The " wind " nature sound is the perfect white noise . I leave it on all the time . I also play his lullaby CD and the it sounds great ! I used to use the CD player that attaches to the crib , ( it sells in the baby stores)but the sound quality was very poor . I could n't believe I was listening to the same CD the first time I played it in the Timex ! The indiglo face sets off a cool blue light and the time is nice and big and easy to read . I would definitely recommend it .
5 #### This stuff is the real deal . Just do n't use it on something you may want to take apart . can be done but requirs heat gun and patience . Am using it as caulking to restore a mahogany boat .
5 #### Fit perfectly on 2004 Chevy Avalanche . Took more time to prep than to install and all works great . Total time to install was maybe 20 minutes !
1 #### They are not flat and wobble diagonally . Tested on multiple surfaces and locations . Had to return .
5 #### I 've used this stuff for over 15 years on all my vehicles and never had a problem . Majority of the sound dampening material serves its purpose and ratings are based on personal opionion . I like this pack because they went with the all black Dynamat instead of the traditional silver . Who cares anyway because this stuff applies behind the door panels and floor boards and nobody will really see it . I purchased two bulk packs for my 2004 Toyota 4Runner Limited . The sound was pretty solid on a few systems installed on my past vehicles : - 2 ( 12 " ) Alpine Type - R 's with 1KW on a 1990 Lexus LS400 - 2 ( 12 " ) Memphis Mojos with 1500W on a 1990 Lexus LS400 - 3 ( 10 " w2 's ) JL Audio with 1KW on a 2004 Toyota 4Runner Limited - 4 ( 13.5 " w7 's ) JL Audio with 4KW on a 2004 Toyota 4Runner Limited ( IN PROGRESS )
5 #### This cost me $ 1.29 and it works better that any charger I have ever bought . This even has a safety release so It will not come undone during travel . Great price and works perfectly .
1 #### DO NOT BUY this crap . They say it 's waterproof , but it 's not . Mine dropped in salt water , for not even 2 secs , and started corroding and stopped working.$40 down the drain .
5 #### Came across a suggestion to use this stuff when researching a fix for a random missfire issue that I just could n't nail down . I 'd done just about everything suggested , replaced plugs , wires , ignition coils and even pulled the very difficult to get to and clean EGR . I added an entire 16 oz can to a full tank of gas and immediately noticed the car was running amazingly smooth ! The car has n't run like that for almost 6 years ! I ran one more can through at next fillup for good measure and my check engine light has n't been back . No more mystery random misfire . I 've used it on the other vehicles in the same manner . Cars definitely run better with this in the tank . I do n't know why , but it works ! The only fuel additive I 'll ever buy now . Works slower but safer through the gas tank than using through the brake booster hose . ( may take 2 treatments , but this one works unlike so many others ) Wo n't fix a bad part that needs replacing ( not magic )
5 #### Works great , currently using with supplied antenna on jeep runs and getting about 1/2 mile range , good enough for club runs . Will add external antenna to achieve full range when time allows .
2 #### the eyecups were too short for my eyes so you have to hold it away from your eyes and balance it in the air to see through it , cheap but in the end not usable for me ...
5 #### Everything you need in one package to two any size trailer !
4 #### Nothing wrong with 4 stars as it was a gift , which pleased the new owner .
5 #### Bought this for my aspiring photographer daughter . She loves it . Point made ! Seems to be very durable and made well .
5 #### Bought for my daughter for her sound engineering class . They are versatile ( 2 types of connection ) for home and studio . Great sound high and low frequency and buffer ambient sound pretty well . Highly recommend . Not the best money can buy , but a good deal .
1 #### I do n't have much to say other than i got the the screen , installed it . Happy that i finally could get to use my phone again .. No such luck all i get is a green distorted screen .. I think it is faulty .. will wait for a response before i comment further . DISAPPOINTED . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I used this to condition numerous knife sheaths and have excellent results . 1 liter goes a long way . I like that it softens the leather .
5 #### I carry a personal and a business phone . I was looking for a headset that would connect to 2 phones without any manual re - pairing needed when I switch between the two . This headset answers which ever phone is ringing . If both phones receive a call , it sends the second one to voice mail . It does a great job without my having to do anything after the initial pairing of the two phones . It works beautifully .
4 #### its only one , I was expecting 2 of them , so i think it is kind of pricy for a plastic mirror .
5 #### I bought this for my wobbly 81 year old mother . She is hoping it will strengthen her legs and give her some stability . She loves it . And her PT people love it too . It 's well - made and has 2 levels of height .
2 #### a very cheap material and the color fades so easily
1 #### The jacks are yellow , not red . They do n't really go as high as I 'd like them to . Also , the cradles that hold the car up have a deep half - circle groove in - between some flat areas that are just a bit too far apart to hold my Jeep 's main body frame safely . I ended up buying a 6 - ton set at O - Riley 's in town that are a much better set for close to the same price as these . Not only are they safer ( it 's unlikely that the Jeep will slip off a poorly designed stand top ) , they 'll also go up higher and hold more weight . I might look into returning these because I just do n't think I 'll use them ever again .
5 #### I installed these on a custom brush guard on my 97 Tahoe 4 door 4x4 . A week later a bad storm came through . I am bad afraid of storms ... and a tornado was heading straight for us . So , I got the wife and the dogs and we got in the truck and ran . It was practically there by the time we started to leave : intense lightening , wind , sirens , and rain had stopped . We drove out of its path through the hardest wind and thickest rain I had ever been in . The ONLY way I made it out was with these lights . The little bit that I could see was because of these lights , without them I was blind . There were few cars on the road , the ones that were just followed behind me . I am glad I had these lights when I needed them most . The tornado missed my house by maybe a mile , too close . I was not sure how the cheap mounts it came with would work , they worked fine . They stay in place on bumpy dirt roads , interstate , and high wind . Good enough for me . The lights are amazingly bright . I will never have another truck or SUV without them .
3 #### These are great sounding headsets with lots of control and comfort . Unfortunately , I bought two pairs of these for my wife and son , who both wear eyeglasses . My wife wanted a bluetooth headset for internet books , etc . and my son wanted the headsets for gaming . BAD NEWS -- these are almost impossible to use while wearing eyeglasses . Come on Motorola ! Do n't your design engineers wear glasses ? How did they sell this design to their program managers and marketing teams ? No wonder they are on sale !
4 #### Purchased with mounting kit and while it seemed a bit intimidating , it was actually quite simple and easy . I spent more time cutting the splash guard to fit over the brackets than anything else . Only other part that was a bit time consuming was putting the bar on the brackets to test fit , just to take it back off and put it back on again . Otherwise looks great on my car . Got a wiring harness and a set of LED fogs here on amazon as well .
5 #### Case is great . To bad Neat Software ( as of today ) has switched to a cloud based service and has stopped supporting the non cloud based software . If you already own a scanner , this product fits nicely . If you are looking to by a scanner / software package for your receipts , STAY AWAY FROM NEAT !
4 #### It claims to stop " string talk , " when you rub fingers on wound strings . It does n't . But it does reduce it somewhat , and it also helps me keep playing even when my fingers get sore from playing too long , or playing a new song over and over . I gather my fretting fingers together and spray a little bit of this stuff right onto my fingertips . Seems to help my callouses without messing them up , and reduces the tenderness under the callouses that comes after a lot of playing .
5 #### As always , these fit perfectly . I bought a cheeper brand from another seller on Amazon for a different vehicle , and I have to say that these are well worth the extra few dollars . These go on easy , and are very well made . They make my truck look really sharp
3 #### These were too small for my adult head . I ended up giving them to my kid , which is a pity because the sound was really nice .
5 #### We love these little Zenergy chimes ! The sound is pure and loud , and the presentation with the wooden base , aluminum rods and little mallot is quite beautiful . Buy one , you wo n't regret it at all . We bought our first set of these , the Zenergy5 with five chimes , as a bit of a lark . They rapidly became a favorite , which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time . The chimes sat on an end table , and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them . We lost the five - note chimes after we had a party and our house , and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them . At the end , we gave the chimes to him , which delighted him , and of course delighted us as well . The next day , we purchased the Zenergy3 three - rod version of the chimes , simply to have something different . We are equally happy with the three - tone chime . Hint : Be sure to shop around ! Vendors offer these chimes here on Amazon at a variety of price points , including shipping .
5 #### Well worth the price . If you 're like me I have many trailers of different sizes to work with . Changing balls is much easier than switching recievers like I used to not to mention the storage of them . I 've used the tri ball hitches and they are heavy and bulky . This is the way to go for sure .
3 #### This case was OK . it was bulky and started to stretch out over time . It would have a bunch of lint on it after being in my pocket .
5 #### good stuff . use this with stabil and injector cleaner and yer 2 cycle motor will always start fast , and last .
1 #### The piece delivered to me does not have the clips to install on wiper arm of the car , what purpose does it server if we ca nt install it . Was expecting a better qualify from this delivery
5 #### Best pics in the market today . High quality construction and never been disappointed with these .
5 #### Canon came out with some tiny digital cameras . I personal have the Canon ELP S110 . No difference in size with the S100 . This case is a must have . Velco strap secure the camera inplace with an extra zipper pouch allowing you to carry an extra CF card and a spare battery . Protect your investment . Go and pick one up . Note : This case will not fit the S300 .
5 #### I use only Elixir , and the acoustic phosphor bronze nanoweb are my strings of choice . They not only sound great , with just the right amount of brightness , but they last at least 3 months longer than other non - coated strings . I 'm not kidding . I gig three or four times a month in pubs and play every single day , and they last and last . And the coating makes it a bit easier on your fingers , too ( I got a set of Martin acoustics as a gift from a friend and put them on my main guitar -- the tips of my fingers were taking a beating ! And the strings did n't last more than two or three weeks before " that smell of rust " could be detected . That just does n't happen with Elixirs ) .
5 #### This is a very comprehensive kit . Have worked on several carburetors and this is hands down a quality kit ....
4 #### I love this item ; although I do n't use the belt clip I love the way it fits my device . It snuggly fits my palm ! ! ! I have a friend that bought the same item for 30.00 at the retail store and she likes mine better . U ca n't beat the price ! ! !
3 #### It works . Does n't feel like very high quality . I do n't think these have changed at all since the 80 's . That said , I ordered 2 and they both worked . They are n't terribly expensive so ... it is what it is .
5 #### I never thought that a cable could get bad reviews , but I guess I was wrong . Anyway , I ordered this and it works great . I used it to extend my new Uverse router to a more central part of the house . I did not lose any speed , it works great , very pleased with the purchase
5 #### The iTorch IMP52D External Battery Pack is an Awesome product ! I love that this product comes with the extra laser pointer & the LED flashlight . I no longer have to sit next to an outlet just to charge my phone . It is a very reasonable price & charges my Samsung Galaxy S - III super fast . It charged my phone three times before having to plug the battery pack in to recharge it . I rate this item 5 stars & would recommend it to family & friends .
4 #### When I opened the package it took a minute before I even knew what it was ! I was expecting a red stick bag like the picture , but mine was black . Okay , but I 'd prefer the red ... what I ordered ! Anyway , the thing will clamp on almost anywhere , and although the material of the bag is a bit stiff , it does the job .
4 #### The leads are all a nice length to work with . The only down side is it is a universal wiring harness so you may not use all the wires . As a result you may end up with wires hanging loose .
5 #### These tools allow for removal of Delta style connectors on my Chevrolet , without them the plastic housings for the electrical pin type connectors are damaged if a screw driver is used or something similar . Price was right . Not made in the USA .
5 #### Got it for my 91 ' Cordova 230 . It was a lot of work , but well worth it , brought the shine to a 25 y / o boat back . Recommend a variable speed buffer to assist . This s * * * is amazing .
5 #### Hey guys and gals , If you play music ( electronic ) with amps and processors and all the gizmos , believe me when I tell you , GOOD Cords Are Imperative ... Buy a couple and see . Thanx Jonny G
5 #### My thrush turbo muffler , Sounds great ... my car has cat removed and resonator removed ... With this muffler it has the deap rich sound I was looking for .... had to make mods for it but hey it was worth it .... So if you want a muffler that sounds great without the exesive noise , nice and compact ... and does n't restrict the air flow this is the muffler you want ... I put it on my 02 sable 3.0 vulcan engine has ram air intake and sounds great .........
5 #### Keeps my bluetooth ear piece safe and protected . A definite buy recommendation from me . Simple and well designed , no charging capability though .
5 #### Worked out of the box with my cable box in northern California . Better than the original . It was easy to program for the tv too .
1 #### The product is made of plastic . When adjusting any vibration moves the mirror and it does not stay aligned properly .
5 #### Good price , have not checked speeds because all I use it for is my phone .
5 #### I love these ! There is some noise leakage to those near me if I have my I - Pod cranked way up , but other than that , I do n't have anything but good things to say about these ! Definately recommend .
4 #### Use these while watching movie on the PC or Pandora . Also use with the Sansa and Sony MP3 players . Bass is good but these do not cancel sound .
4 #### This product had an amazingly low price , and replaces an unruly adapter and headset combination . The adapater alone had cost more than $ 20 . Now this product replaces everything in a single piece , with the added benefit of an inline control , all at a fraction of the price . Great product , but now it reminds me I spent way too much on the first one .
3 #### Overall its good but the DC cable is short . I tried to put it in to my car 's charger it works but short cable is the only problem . Ca nt reach enough back seat
2 #### I wo n't give them too much flack as there are dozens of drill patterns in silverados , suburbans , sierras I 'm sure , but then do n't call them custom . I needed to have a drill on hand , and even then you ca n't really get these on easily . Might have been easier if I had a full jack to raise the car up overhead and could get a bright light in there to see how to put them on more easily .
5 #### no issues with this product came early than expected have everywhere rather than moving also great to keep plugged into computer for iPhone downloads keeps more space for memory for iphone
4 #### This phone is like 40 bucks cheaper than the Epic 4G. If your in the market for a new phone , do n't get this one ! The Samsung Epic 4 G is EVERYTHING this phone is not ... This phone is no longer supported by sprint . When you call about it , they are like , " What 's a Moment ? " It 's the phone they forgot they released . I have it and I like it a lot . But I envy the epic 4 g and I am getting it income tax time . this is a good phone ! I really like it . I do n't use the custom stock rom because this guy " noobnl " makes rooted awesome , crap free roms that support free wifi tether . If you google noobnl , click the first link that shows up . The battery lasts WAY longer if you use a custom rom . I have tried MANY different roms , and noobnl 's rom seems to be the best ! There are constantly updates and my Samsung Moment works way better , boots up faster , has built in wifi tether with the rom , and it 's pre rooted . So if you have this phone , google noobnl and follow the directions and your phone will be much faster and work much better . If your looking to buy a new android phone for sprint , the Samsung Epic 4 G kicks this phone in the you know what , over and over again .
5 #### This is the best case I have found . I looked at others and ordered at least one other before I got this one . The texture is perfect - never slips ( many cases are slippery ) . It also fits perfectly - unlike others that keep falling off the phone , this one truly is a ' body glove ' for the phone . Wish it came in other colors , but this is a classic style , functional , and high quality . Plus , it 's less than 1/2 the price that it was at the phone store .
1 #### It is falling apart after first use . One car waxing .
5 #### I am able to get clear and crisp images of landscapes and cityscapes . Would recommend this product to any photographer .
5 #### Worked really well for my fist time replacing strings . If you are changing your guitar strings I recommend this product .
4 #### It 's always good to have a spare wall wart or two laying around , and it 's good to replace older units with newer technology and higher current output . An effect might claim it only needs 100 mA but it wo n't turn down 200 or 300 if you offer it- and it might run even cooler if you do .
3 #### Its an oil spray to make sure a K&N air filter works . What do you expect ? Hint : Its an oil and it 's got a cleaner stuff with it .
4 #### The Alaska Piks are pretty good . I spent some time filing and working with them , but they just do n't feel like my fingernails . They 'll be good as a fall back , but I think I stick with my nails .
5 #### The stabilization function is excellent . The only con for these binoculars is the fact that they 're rather larger than they should be . Surely , Canon has a much more compact stabilization assembly by now !
5 #### I was recommended to buy Alaska Piks by my professor when I was in college , and have loved them ever since . The picks hug each finger on the right hand and allow for the fingernail to go through the far slit and rest on the outer edge of the pick . The meat of the finger is still exposed , but the plastic pick acts as a nail , so the resulting effect is that you have a long , sturdy fingernail to play the strings with . As a player of many styles on the guitar , these picks bring out the best tone from my guitar . Not only is the sound crisper , but it 's significantly louder . In contrast , playing with a bare right hand creates a muffled , dull , soft sound . The Alaska Piks are a little spendy , but if you take care of them you wo n't need more than four . As far as size goes , I have average sized hands and play with an XL on the thumb , a L on the index and middle , and a M on the ring . If you like playing fingerstyle anything , buy these - you wo n't regret it .
5 #### So far so good , no complaints . I would purchase this again . Received same day . Great sound , no breaking up .
3 #### The price was unbelievable . $ 0.01 - one penny , that 's how much the price was , plus s&h total about $ 3 . I do n't know why the price was so low but I 'm very happy with my purchase ! The design is great . When I tighten it around my arm it never moves no matter how fast I am running . It feels very tight and I feel my phone is perfectly secure inside it . This is a high quality product . I almost purchased another one for $ 25 but I 'm glad I tried my luck for this product which sold for one penny . The 3GS screen can be easily accessed when inside it too . I do n't have any complaints . It works , it looks great , it is of great quality , the strap is elastic and tightens up really well , gets the job done , works for what I bought it for . Happy customer ! UPDATE : I 'm no longer happy with this product . Buy yourself a quality product instead . I drop my rating from 5 to 3 . I only bought this because it was $ 0.01 at the time .
5 #### Very good add on to my truck in the front
4 #### It does what it 's designed for . Bought another Sanyo HDTV & wanted to connect it to my audio system to experience surround sound again . This mini - jack to RCA is needed to make this connection . The sound is hi - fi although the amp needs to be set at a higher volume to match to volume coming through HDMI circuits . It 's economical , arrived within 4 days and has good fidelity . All good .
5 #### I am pleased . This cable works fine and is priced right . The one right angle end piece is just what I needed to connect to the rear of my keyboard while enabling it to be as close to the wall as possible . Note that his is not an expensive high end cable . My 5 star rating compares this product to other value priced cables . That said , this cable is made well .
4 #### easy to use , very solid . the double locking is a great feature but is kind of over kill . Love it !
4 #### The keeper works great in holding the items I 've placed at the rear or the front of the pickup box for easier access to them !
5 #### I bought these because they are purple . Good quality cables for a good price . Really though , they are purple , and that 's why I bought them .
1 #### I would give this zero stars if i could ; the seller MUST know this is way , WAY too small ! It is going back ASAP .
1 #### USELESS ! ! S***ty little skinny skinny bands . Not what you expect when they describe them as 8 " length . These are like the smallest zip ties , very thin , but long ! CRAP !
5 #### This is just a great deal . These are the same exact battery strips you see hanging on the rack at your local battery store . For less than what they charge for 1 , you get a strip of 5 . Unfortunately , you ca n't just buy 1 for 1/5 the price , so if you do n't need all 5 , you 'll end up wasting batteries over time . I decided to get a full strip since I have a bunch of quartz watches , and this is a fairly common size . I 'll probably use 3 - 4 before they all go dead . Seller ships quickly , but there is no tracking ability , and they ship the battery strip in a standard letter - size envelope .
4 #### Some people just ca n't catch a break . First , Jack Nightingale may or may not have killed a man , so his police career is over and replaced by a pretty shabby career as a private detective . Then , random people start telling him that , " You are going to hell , Jack ... " Then at age 32 he finds out he was adopted , which was bad enough until he finds out who his birthfather was . And as if that is not enough , he finds out that his birth father sold his soul to a devil , who is coming in a couple of weeks to collect . Wow , that could really keep you from looking forward to your birthday . In the novel , Jack has to face the unexpected and then the unlikely . In fact , a fair amount seems to be simple insanity . As he finds out more , though , he also realizes that he had better be ready for anything -- much of that insanity is starting to sound all too likely . Stephen Leather introduces us in this book to a protagonist who is a good man to know , but who has to face a personal crisis beyond anything he has already faced . How he meets this crisis makes it clear that he is would be a good person to have on your side . The question is whether just being a good person is enough to get out of " You are going to hell , Jack ... "
5 #### They are Elixirs . as a newer guitar player I finally broke down and bought them after numerous recommendations . Lets face it , they are the best for a reason if you have any finger issues especially .
4 #### Bought as a gift for my son , and he 's very pleased with it . What can you say ? It 's a guitar strap , it does the job , and looks good . And $ 20 for a Levy 's Leather strap is a good deal . I got the gold , and it 's good - looking without being garish .
3 #### The case seems almost indestructable . fits well . I will probably use it on trips but its really too bulky for my taste .
5 #### This cable does exactly as it is advertised to do . No pops , clicks , or other unwanted noise is inserted into my signal chain . There are more expensive cables out there , and they have their application , but for my occasional use , this one works just fine .
5 #### Bought this for my computer to hook up the audio to a house stereo receiver . Works great and the price is excellent . These are always nice to have around .
4 #### IT WORKED LIKE BRAND NEW . HOW EVER MY PHONE IS NOT CHARGING NOW , SO I MAY HAVE TO GET A NEW ONE AND THIS CHARGER MAY NOT WORK WITH THE NEW ONE .
5 #### This was a perfect fit for my moms phone . better price than at the store , almost 70 percent less . Fast shipment as well , arrived on time .
5 #### Wow , was I surprised how well this vacuum works . I did n't expect much , but to my surprise it did a great job in cleaning my vehicle . It left nothing behind . Worth the price .
5 #### I just used these pads for the first time today . I have a Dodge Ram and applied wax with one pad and polished / removed it with the other ( I used two in total ) . This stuff about the pads falling apart is nonsense . I did my large truck and put a fair amount of pressure on my orbital polisher . The pads , other than looking a little dirty , look about new . I 'd say they hold up very well . I am going to order a few more as today I put my wax on a little thicker than I should have and my polishing pad got a little wet . Trying to polish after that got a little rougher than I would have expected , but luckily I was almost done and remembered I had two hands and a rag .
1 #### I 've been a blackberry costumer for about 6 years , always buying genuine accessories , this is my second holster for my blackberry 9800 torch ; the first one hardly last 2 months in one piece , the back where the clip holds separate in to layers , then the complete plastic clip came off ; so ok , maybe it was a defective item , and I order another one , but the story was the same , first the thin cloth layer separate , then the back start to splits in to paper layers ; my option for a holster is the designed for the blackberry storm , the edges are stitched and it looks like real leather , not a fancy fake leather like the one for the torch .
5 #### This is the best value in a china for a metal or hard rock band . It has lots of trash and sizzle ad a fairly bright sound . It really cuts through the mix during a breakdown . And the price is good . Chinas usually do n't live very lonng cause drummers smack the crap out of them . This China is pretty durable , and it 's cheap enough to replace often if you need to .
4 #### My only question is how long the battery will last . We 're used it about 6 hours now , we 'll see if it lasts longer .
3 #### Not as good as the 835 series ... no ascending descending tones to let you know it 's on or off ... just continuous tones . Some static in reception ... hey , it 's cheaper ! ! !
5 #### Solid and compact . I use them on my 5 series BMW and Honda CRV(Compact SUV ) . Plenty of extra weight capacity for even my heavy cars . I do n't have alot of room , so it 's important that these can fit in a corner of my garage . I find them very easy to put back into the box they came from when I 'm done . 5 stars .
5 #### I bought this on an auction site . However its the same product . It is really well made and will not tilt over since it feels solid . I was really pleased at the automatic bedside mode feature where the clock comes on when its in this cradle ( It comes on when you plug in the blackberry the normal way as well , so its more of the Curve 8900 's feature then the cradles ) so it makes for a great bedside clock . The light that 's on this pod is also very useful when you want to place it on the cradle at night . Of course the only issue is that if you buy a crystal cover to protect your blackberry you ca n't really use this since you have to take the cover off every time you want to put it on this charging pod , so a silicone cover may be better if you want to use this since it can be slipped off easily . Your existing charger 's USB connector plugs into this device . I enjoy using this especially with Slacker Radio , Flycast and other applications that can consume quite a bit of battery power , so it also works as my desktop radio , MP3 player etc . An overall comment on the 8900 , its really an amazing device . It has replaced my ipod , my GPS receiver , my radio , my alarm clock , and even my Archos video player .
1 #### The unit seems to be locked to AT&T , it has an AT&T connection manager that ca n't be disabled and loads when the unit is plugged in . Even though I installed the software from Option it still wo n't connect with T - Mobile . In fact the thing does n't pick up any wireless services at all so I do n't think it even works . Also it kept asking me for a PIN which I do n't have . A Zoom Model 4597 works fine on the same laptop with the same SIM card .
2 #### It clicks on easy and looks sharp :) . But then when I tried to remove it , I was afraid I was going to have to break my phone just to get it off . After taking it on and off a few times to get to my sd card , battery , etc , part of it broke and I decided not to mess with it or with the other similar one I bought because the chance of it protecting my phone seemed less than the chance of it damaging my phone : s.
5 #### The Absorber Synthetic Drying Chamois does work well and does absorb water quickly . When try , it is very stiff and sometimes can be difficult to store . Nonetheless , it works as advertised and we would purchase this Drying Chamois again .
5 #### as described and functioned as expected , even when mashed in closed door
4 #### Product did n't come with any means of putting it on the wall . I suggest you get some 3 M double sided tape to attach this to your wall ( or you will have to drive nail through the little holes on top ) works well though . Has saved my door many times in the short time I owned it .
5 #### Started using them for my tiny USB3 drives . Very handy to have these tails ! :)
3 #### Came stuck to packaging and could n't get little pieces of paper off the glue , I also wonder why the manufacturer did n't send the little ones for the rear windows too .
4 #### Does a good job of smoothing rough areas of your car 's finish . It is an absolute mother to remove so just apply to areas that need it and do small sections at a time . This is not for using on your whole car .
5 #### No issues with these just do what the instructions say and there it is . Had no real issues putting on the protector . You must make sure there is no dust on the screen . Where can you find a place where there is no dust , mmmmm ?
5 #### I got the picks well within time . The green pick may not look attractive to all , but it is very nice ... The plastic is not to hard nor too soft . Also i got 3 Free picks , hence total 15 picks for me . Initially I got a little skeptical after opening the pack and seeing the size . I thought the size is small for my fingers , but they are perfect .
4 #### The review led me to believe this item would charge my 9700 it does not . You must have a charger to plug into the back of the pod . It works though . I recommend getting it with a charger , unless you have one you use .
5 #### I have been playing for 35 years , about 9 of them professionaly . I have also worked as a set - up man , and , made guitars both acousctics and hard body that people seem to really like . I am a graduate engineer by trade . Anyway I have used this product as well as many others and prefer it . The only down side is it is an aerosol . However it does not contain any chiorocarbons or fluorocarbons and claims not to harm stratospheric ozone . It does contain aliphatic hydrocarbons however it works great without any oiliness . In my humble opinion this is the best choice as a string lubricant .
5 #### Works as it should . MIDI does nt need anything fancy . Just buy it and move on ! ! !
5 #### This headset has been better than I expected . The sound is clear , my voice comes across great , and the battery life is very long . I love this headset !
5 #### We had to replace 2 Tie Rod end boots on my son 's Blazer . I have use other methods and this was by far the easiest to do . It does not rip up the boot like the forks , everything came apart as it should .
2 #### Does not fit the unit very well that I bought it for , ca n't see the screen very well with this on the unit . This carring case needs to be redesigned , I do n't like it . I bought this case for the etrex 10 .
1 #### No body could hear me or understand what I was saying . That is using the Jabra in my office at home with no background noise . It went right back to Amazon . Save for time and money . I like the Plantronics Margue 2 . Crystal clear on both ends
5 #### THE PRICE IS LOW AND THE PRODUCT WORKS WONDERFULLY . I PROBABLY WILL NOT HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER WATCH BATTERY FOR YEARS .
4 #### Well built , functional , and works . There 's not much to be said about a VGA cable , I mean there are n't any blinky lights , or bells , or whatnot , it 's just a cable , and it works like it should .
5 #### After having been disappointed by a couple of other types of mirrors prior to finding these , I was cautiously optomistic when buying these . I give these mirrors my highest reccomendation after using them . For quality of materials both in the mount as well as the mirror itself . These install and adjust like a breeze .
5 #### Update : These strings completely changed the tone on my Martin DC - RGTE and NOT for the better . Not sure why or if I am so use to hearing the DR Rares , but I do not like these AT ALL on my Martin . They were fine on my Takamine and sounded great , but for some reason they sound like tin on the Martin . I 'm gon na give them about another 2 weeks and if the sound does n't warm up and bring back the tone iI am use too , I 'll be ordering another set of the DR Rare These strings are excellent .... BUT ... I have done the comparison twice purposely to prove my point to a few friends and in my opinion , these are not worth the money . You can buy the DR " Rare " strings for half the price and not only do they sound just as good but they DO last just as long . Both the Elixir & DR Rare are excellent strings , they both feel great , they both sound great and they both keep their tone for a long time , but I ca nt see spending double the price on the Elixir when the DR 's are half the price . With that said , if I was n't able to buy the Dr 's locally for $ 8.00 / pack , I would probably cave in and spend the extra money and buy the Elixir . Do n't take my word for it ... See for yourself .. get a set of these http://www.amazon.com/DR-Strings-Rare-Phosphor-AcousticHex/dp/B000788VUG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427550453&sr=8-1&keywords=dr+rare
2 #### bought these in January 2012 for our adt security system motion sensor . These batteries are supposed to last 5 years but less than 2 years later , I 'm purchasing new ones . They did not come in retail packaging but loose in a ziploc bag . I did n't check the charge out of the package because I did n't have that type of tool to gauge battery charge
5 #### This cymbal stand is from a year ago when I started and had held a 10 " splash , 20 " ride , and14 " crash , but I found a new feature , it is also a boom stand ! ! ! ! Simply lift the last part of the stand until it comes out , then turn the tilter ! The tilter is strong enough to hold my 20 " ride while on full extension ! I am more then pleased with this product !
5 #### SHHHH ... Don't tell anyone how good this is . I want the tone out of my Les Paul to be unique . I paid a lot more for Bare Knuckle Pickups ( Rebel Yells ) and they 're nice , but these are great for crunchy classic rock to high gain mayhem . Anything from early Clapton to Ozzie and everything in between . Great string separation and articulation . Not muddy , even with the gain cranked on my Marshall Dual Super Lead . I 'm very happy with this bridge pickup and may well buy a set to replace the BKP 's in my other Lester . I highly recommend them ( but do n't tell anyone ) !
5 #### Great power - up for the Lenovo T420s , which has a slot for it underneath the keyboard . Fast !
1 #### At first this case looks so fine , and the after a while having it on your iphone it starts loosing that silver look it becomes yellowish which looks very ugly .
5 #### works just like the expensive ones from the cellular store
3 #### good build and durable , a little bulky and would like it to charge the radio faster . The DC connector that connects to the radio is a little large so it will be a little bit of a tight fit and wo n't allow it to rotate with ease . Trimming of the rubber on the connector might be a good idea if you do n't mind a little detail work .
3 #### I used this while traveling in Europe and would have been lost without it as I used it to charge up my smartphone w/ GPS . I managed to completely charge my phone 3 times over a two day period when I was staying in a hostile with no way to securely charge my smartphone . This product has one significant downside that my Samsung Galaxy S might be partially responsible for . The micro - usb adapter frequently disconnected from my phone . I tried keeping it in my side pocket , in my backpack , in my backpack 's water bottle pouch and in a cellphone specific pocket in my cargo pants . The only I was able to get it to stay consistently connected was by wedging the phone between this charged and my kindle , with my kindle on the outside of my pocket so that there was very little chance of any non - flat surface from touching the adapter . If the charge cable had been less bulky or had a tighter fit in my phone charge port I doubt this would have been an issue . Another issue I have is that the frustrating micro - sd adapter has broken after about 40 charging sessions . I have n't contacted the manufacturer for a replacement but hopefully that wo n't be too much of an issue .
5 #### I bought 2 of these headphones . I also bought a splitter with seperate volume control ( see review ) Ithese are lightweight and fit in my laptop , pandigitasl novel . and its panasonic ! !
4 #### These are really good strings , but somewhat expensive . These strings last a good while & easy on the fingers . Will continue to use .
3 #### I have a slight hearing problem and this device seems limited on volume compared to my others . Comfort leaves a little to be desired .
2 #### Does great at drying , but I follow every direction on the bottle and it smells like mildew every time I go to use it , no matter how many times I hand wash it . I 've used similar products in the past & it did not stink .
2 #### Was to small for the rear window but it said it would fit
5 #### I 've read a few reviews with folk saying a regular 2x8 or 2x10 does n't fit under the lip of the ramp . If those folks had taken a second to look at the directions , the board is n't meant to go under the lip of the ramp It 's meant to butt up against the lip . So no chiseling , sanding or whining and complaining is necessary . Hold board to ramp , butt it against the lip , drill 2 holes and bolt together . Really could n't be easier .
5 #### I used this on a PT Cruiser . I had to grind about 1/2 inch off the corners of the hex in order to get it deep enough to reach the nut . It took about 5 minutes and then it worked very well . Considering the price , this was a 5 star deal .
5 #### These are by far my favorite strings , they have great tone , they are loud , and the feel great to play , I would n't play with anything else
5 #### This is so easy I wish I had it 40 yrs ago . No more mess from drain plugs and spills . Very easy to use . I changed the oil in all 5 of my mowers in about 30 minutes .
5 #### Nice duster and sure makes cleaning the car easy when there is no time to wash .
5 #### Cheap and accurate I purchased this gauge for my boat . Installation was a breeze ! Simple 2 wire hookup . Great gauge . Had to drill a 2 " hole for installation but it does come with a mounting bracket .
1 #### Product came damaged , so I returned it . Quality was not what I expected and for the price not worth it .
5 #### bought this for a friend who kept butt - dialing his friends and family . the magnet worked and locked the phone . no more butt - dialing for him !
5 #### cable construction is solid ; at least as good as OEM . works for EVO ; I bought extras to leave at office . wish they made one with 6 " cable .... most of the time I am just using it to hook up to a computer to charge .
4 #### While it 's not a very fast lens , one will be hard - pressed at finding one with as wide of a focal range and as quiet of a motor as this one at this price . I 've shot with this lens in a church and I could n't hear it focus even then . Images could be a little sharper , but I 'm not complaining . I highly recommend it !
4 #### These have a good fit and look good on the truck . Couple of the holes lined up with factory and had to drill a couple .
5 #### Very well made . Functions beautifully . Tension can be adjusted before or after putting on the neck and works smoothly . I bought the 12 - string version and returned it for a standard 6 - string version because it was too long even for my 12 - string . The rubber part of the 12 - string version is 2.25 " long while the 6 - string is 2.0 " long . Measure across all your strings and see if they are more than 2.0 " apart . I think the 12 - string version would only be needed for EXTREMELY wide fretboards .
5 #### legendary performance indeed ! works perfectly , extremely easy to set up , very good sound , good price , that 's 'bout all you need to know !
5 #### Bought this teak oil to restore several pieces of older teak furniture - it worked great for a fraction of the price that other oils cost . Simple to apply .
3 #### Works fine but is n't really snug in there . It has popped out once or twice but that has seemed to stop . It looks okay , it does have holes in the bottom so debri can make it through to the other side if you are not careful .
1 #### I ORDERED THIS 2 X 'S FROM 2 DIFFERENT MERCHANTS ON AMAZON . UNFORTUNATELY NOT ONE OF THEM WORKED ! FIRST ONE DID NOT GIVE AUDIO AND 2ND ONE DID NOT PAIR TO MY PHONE AT ALL . I TRIED EVERYTHING ! SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I NEED A GOOD HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH FOR MY CAR . WOW ! I JUST WISHED IT WOULD WORK . OBVIOUSLY THE SELLERS DID NOT MAKE SURE THESE WERE WORKING PRODUCTS , ESPECIALLY THE 2ND MERCHANT I ORDERED FROM BECAUSE THIS WAS SOLD USED AND THE BAG IT CAME IN STAMPED ON THE IT SAID " GRADED BY WAREHOUSE DEALS " SO I WOULD BEWARE OF THIS SELLERS USED MERCHANDISE . A RETURN COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BOTH TIMES HAD THEY MADE SURE IT WAS WORKING PROPERLY . I ALSO WROTE TO THE MANUFACTURER AND WILL NOT ORDER THIS " SUPERTOOTH BUDDY BLUETOOTH VISOR SPEAKERPHONE CAR KIT " AGAIN . I WILL GO TO ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR SURE ! !
5 #### The extension core and the multiple outlets makes this an excellent product ....
4 #### This is the best BT of the iPhone that I have found . I have tried 6 different BT devices tis year and this is the best one s far . I wear the BT 8 to 10 hours a day without any discomfort . I have hearing loss from being routinely exposed to loud noise levels while in the US Army ( The M-16 m4 makes a loud bang when fired ) , but I have no problem hearing with this device , even when diving with the windows down . The BT device comes with different pieces that attach around your ear ( 2 for the right ear and two for the left ear ) and several different ear cushions that sit in your ear . It fits so well , I forget that the jawbone is in my ear . The call quality is excellent according to my spouse . The reason for only four stars is the buttons , while only two , are hard to press . Other than that small problem , this is a great BT headdest .
5 #### Very clean and simple design . Installs easily with a drill . It helps to have a friend hold and line them up with you . Once I got them to where I wanted it on one side , I put two screws in the top , measured the height , did the same on the other side , and then jacked up the truck and removed the tires so I could install the last two screws . Did the same for the front . Happy with the results .
4 #### This is a very well made camera bag . However , it is a little small for my Canon 40D. I will use it for short or quick photo trips . It may be fine for a smaller camera , but I have no room for extra lenses , etc .
5 #### This is my third set of these headphones . My previous 2 were the 7506 model but I hear they are exactly the same . I kept selling them in am attempt to upgrade to a more expensive model but I keep coming back to these . They sound so clear without the sibilance that has driven me crazy with a lot of other pricier headphones . The bass is strong and right without being excessive or muddy and the overall sound is very balanced and never tiring . I ca nt recommend these enough
5 #### Do n't buy this for your kick drum , buy it for your bass amplifier . In recording sessions , I have often auditioned a large number or mics on bass guitar amp and every time , this mic smokes anything else I have . Sounds big and gutsy right from the first note , before you have even touched the EQ . You MUST try this on bass amp ! ! ! Easily 5 stars in this application .
5 #### The best part about Mogami is the life time warranty ! ! It 's definitely worth the extra money for that and the quality ! My cat chewed through $ 350 worth mogami cables and I told that to my Guitar Center sales rep and he swapped them out for me ! ! 25 " is a must for my setups too !
5 #### I gave this pick 5 stars because the feel and sound you get from them are outstanding . This material really makes the strings sound brighter and clearer .
4 #### I really like these strings but find them tougher to use than other brands . So far , the strings have lasted but it 's only been about a month , so it 's hard to declare an opinion about their durability .
5 #### I would n't use any other stick ! Highly recommended sticks for those who want a good size , solid stick that 's not too heavy . These are the same size sticks John Bonham used if that helps .
5 #### Used on a coolant heater installation on an F250 . Gates quality .
3 #### I bought this hoping for something sturdier . I was greatly dissapointed to find that it was so flexible . While I am sure this would have prevented scratches if phone was dropped from a moderate level , it slid off the phone every time it was pulled out of my pocket . Go with a rubber case instead .
3 #### Bought just in case I needed an emergency replacement . It works ok . No real rebound on it . I would buy again
5 #### I have a Jeep Laredo 2002 that has the buttons behind the steering wheel to control the d player and we have had much trouble with the cd player here lately . We fear replacing because the controls probably would no longer work . WELL thank you Maxell ! I douby I had this baby in the cd player one whole minute and it works like new again . I even tested the cd twice that I have been having to fight to play at all and it works like a champ on the first go ! I recommend this to anyone . This literally saved me 100 's because I was about to get the cd player replaced .
5 #### First , folks , you need to review the PRODUCT , not the supplier . I agree the people selling these for more than the cost are really gouging . The true retail price for these is $ 29 at the Apple Store . Furthermore , Apple currently has these in stock . You can get this shipped nearly immediately from the online Apple Store . There is no need to be price gouged . These bumpers are , thanks to Apple 's poor antenna engineering on the iPhone 4 , a practical necessity to allow the phone function with decent reception ( unless you want to hold the phone with the tips of your fingers ) . While I might be inclined to knock a star or two off my review of the iPhone 4 , were Amazon to sell it , I have to grudgingly give the Bumpers five stars . They are minimal , yet highly effective . Moreover , they " include " their own metal buttons ( which contact the actual phone buttons beneath ) which really provides a much better experience than the usual cover , which either expects you to hit the button by getting your finger through some tiny hole , or push on the rubber case itself above the obscured phone button . Apple has done a great job with these bumpers .
3 #### I had one at my camp . I loved it . I bought this for a friend , but it did not help their situation .
2 #### They broke within 3 wears . Need to tweak the wire to get both ears to work . Very cheap to purchase so not too surprising and worth trying . The Phillips wired headphones are better
5 #### love the tone of these stringsthey never let me down
5 #### New technology has taken its place with this new style flaring tool . I am more than impressed with the ease of operation and the quality of the materials that make up this tool . Ridgid tools have always been top quality , and this tool is no exception .
5 #### My husband likes this brand of strings and at such a great price we usually order multiples
5 #### I am not a fan of mp3 soundless sound . I am not a fan of most of today 's sound . It lacks the depth and bottom end which makes the music for me . these headphones have an interesting range of sound including bottom end . I bought two pairs and plan on buying more . they are like the phones we used to get w/ portable cassette players - not all that sturdy but they are affordable and sound great .
5 #### this works great . got a generic one from somebody else , did n't work . had to send it back . ordered this one , no more problem
5 #### Great product . Works just as advertised . Most trie treatments give a shiny tire . I wanted the new tire look and it does that .
5 #### I use this on auto repairs to ensure a locked bolt . it only takes a drop . Loctite has the track record of providing a quality thread locking solution so I will continue to use it . Enjoy !
5 #### You already know these strings are great . The value is even better . And they are delivered in 2 day ? No brainer .
5 #### I started playing electric guitar using the widely - known D'Adario strings . Turns out , they do n't sound great OR last long . Next , I tried some Ernie Balls ( on my electric ) and really loved them . I decided then that I would look around for some Ernie Ball acoustic strings and I finally found these . I read the reviews on the " light " strings and they did n't seem as good as the extra light ones here . Sound wise , the lows are fuller and the highs are brighter than Martin strings . ( I had a set of Martin Extra Lights on my acoustic before these ) Only concern is the the high E string feels really thin and I feel like it might snap . That s Extra Light for ya . However , they certainly do bend well ! In conclusion , for the price of these strings , why not ? !
2 #### I used to have this phone long time ago , I bought this for my uncle , but the only problem I had is its hard to hear when you call someone over the phone I ca nt hear them . its ok for the people like basic cell phone .
4 #### This is an excellent product which enables you to have your Blackberry on your desk or bedside table , charging up with the clock - face visible . It 's small and neat , and simplicity itself to use . It 's more convenient than just using the mains charger ( which BTW you 'll need to buy separately ) . It 's also very cheap for a genuine Blackberry accessory . The only minor drawback , pointed out by some other reviewers , is that there is no charging / now fully charged indicator on the device : you 'll know the phone is actively charging when the clock - face is visible , but will need to look at the phone battery power indicator to know when it is fully charged . Overall , recommended for convenience .
5 #### These are extremely nice and they do the job . Makes my work underneath the car much easier and safer !
3 #### It 's a funnel ....... soooooo ....... yea . I used it , then recycled it , because I did n't want to put back in my car .
5 #### I was skeptical , but this is the BEST chamois - type cloth I have ever used . I like it so much , I should sell it at a booth at the county fair !
5 #### It was exactly as described , works well . It was a gift for someone else , they had one before and this was a replacement . They are very happy with it .
4 #### These are my summer strings . I prefer the nanoweb strings , but the humidity in a Tennessee summer causes excessive string squeak . Polywebs are almost as good as the nanowebs , but the have less string squeak .
1 #### I received this product and thought it was great for the 1st week . After about 8 days , it broke and basically fell apart . I 'm not hard on my charger and am very gentle plugging it in . This product is just cheaply put together .
5 #### Love it . Love it . Love it . I can even take calls with it . Wish I could make calls without opening it . But it is the best case I 've ever used . Protects from drop and water . Even store ear buds when not using .
5 #### I have bought K&N before and they do help on gas -- power and fit Great .. They just need to be cleaned and re -oiled .. then place back in .. Instead of the dealer ship selling you NEW ones every 6 to 8000 miles ..
5 #### Great sticks ! ! Great price ! ! Arrived fast , great quality ! ! I have been drumming for many years and these sticks are great ! Especially when weather is hot and hands get wet with sweat . The rubber ends give you great grip and you do n't have to worry about dropping a stick during a gig !
5 #### Just as expected , does the job for me with no issues .
5 #### This cleaner has more brushes , therefore a cleaner CD , and DVD player . I use it on both and am happy with the results .
4 #### I bought this as a gift and the recipient using it on a Kindle said it worked great . The price was very right .
5 #### 2 thumbs up ! Went out and placed one on my trailer 4wire lead and it fit perfect . Would buy again
4 #### This IPhone 3G/3GS charger case is a really great case . It packs enough juice to re - charge your phone almost completely and is very inexpensive . You can charge the phone and/or case without even taking the phone out of the case . There is also an on / off switch so you can control when the case is in the charging mode . I highly recommend this case .
5 #### Wrestled with the new cartridge install . It was my own fault , the dang thing is slippery when when the grease gets on the outside . Once I finally got the cap seated , no mean feat in my opinion , could be better , it 's worked like a charm . Not looking forward to replacing the cartridge , hopefully the grease lasts a while .
5 #### I purchased this for my dad . He was tired of advertising for a camper dealership and wanted a clean look for his spare tire and for the price this was perfect . He is very happy with it so its a win win .
5 #### IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto H700 . It 's larger , and a bit heavier . The boom is larger . But if that 's not an issue , then both are equal IMHO . Both have the cheek problem ! Now for the problem where people can not hear you , or you sound muffled or away from the phone . Wearing your bluetooth , look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it 'll touch that . Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound . Now anything that touches that will impede your voice .... it 's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone . Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen . Unless you have a very narrow face , chances are this will happen to you and you 'll blame it on the bluetooth ! TO fix this , get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end ( mole skin ) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece ( if needed ) on top of the other . This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you ! With this fix , you will still be able to close your boom .
5 #### They are light and have a great sound . They 're perfect for my camera bag . At the price point given , I bought two so I will always have a spare .
5 #### These work as advertised . Perfect size you can cut them down if they end up being too long also . Great for how much you get for so little money . Could come with resealable bag but i do n't even care about that i have zip locs here to store them in
5 #### I think we all know the way the phone companies trying to advertise with the word " Unlimited " . We all know it so well by now that I do n't find it truthful in people complaining that it has a cap . That 's irony to think of it . But let 's face the facts , we all know there are fineprints to all phone services . It used to be Sprint that has truly unlimited data plans . Now not so much anymore . I 'm tired of all the terms in the contracts that once I found Simple Mobile I 'm more than happy to have them . I do worry for the day that they are out of business more than the dreadful Apocalypse in a few days ! ! ! Here 's the break down of why Simple Mobile ( $ 40 Unlimited Plan ): Contract Sign - up : No Subsidized Phones : No ( bring your own unlocked phone ) Customer Service : Meh - OK ( as I 'd expect with any phone companies ) Unlimited Texts : Yes Unlimited International Texts : Yes Unlimited Voice Calls : Yes Unlimited Data : Yes ( 250 MB @4 G speed , the rest is 2G/3 G unlimited ) Connection / Setup Fee : No Late Fee : No . Your line will disconnect after couple of reminder texts . Reconnection Fee : No . Yeah , it 'll work once you make payment again in a few minutes Taxes / Surcharges / Govt Fee : No Early Termination Fee : ? ? ? ? Screw this
5 #### That 's right ... I play the guitar ... Also play the bass , and the kazoo and the triangle ... So what ? ! I 'm not going to sit hear and pretend like you and I are band mates coworkers or in the same bowling team . I like these strings and I like the price . They play well . Been strumming guitars for 30 years pal ... I like what I like . I like these strings . They last a long time . And can stand a good drunk campfire song along when you drink too much , drop your guitar . Let some drunk weirdo pretend to play it and mess it up . Then you can tune it again and go back to playing the campfire songs you were born to play . Like a hero .
4 #### There 's not much I can add to the headline , except that it could be improved with some kind of screen protection ... but I guess that 's what those stick - on sheets are for . The skin will give you a better grip , add a bit of needed bulk , and protect your phone . If you have a Blackberry , you ca n't afford NOT to protect it , and this one is probably the last one you 'll ever need . Save yourself some heartache and just buy it .
5 #### I have a 2000 Dodge Dakota that is falling apart in the bed area on both sides by the wheel well . Mine is actually a silver color and this matched up pretty close as it is silver / gray . I did n't prep the area and just painted this stuff on my rust areas and they were bad . I went back and re - applied a week later . Almost 2 years later and this stuff has stopped the rust ! Does it look new ? Of course not but it did it 's job as promised and will let my old truck keep on rolling down the road . DO NOT USE THIS WITHOUT THE GLOVES SUPPLIED AND COVER YOUR TIRES AND ANYTHING YOU DON"T WANT THIS STUFF ON . I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY . IT DOES NOT COME OFF EASY ! I HAD TO USE GAS AND SCRUB THIS STUFF OF MY TIRES AND HANDS . LOL
2 #### Mine lasted a few months . I keep my stuff well , and it was n't damaged ... twisted , sat on , anything like that . The wires looked good . At work today after using it for a bit on a full charge it suddenly went dead and if I try to recharge it , the red light comes on for a second and goes out . Tried multiple known good chargers . Its broken . All the other headsets I used in the past from LG worked until they were physically destroyed ... broken wires , whatever . Not this one . Another maddening problem with the Buds is no fast forward or rewind . I did n't think to even look for this feature , I assumed no one would make a headset without it . Turns out they do . Another thing I 'm ecstatic about never hearing again is WELCOME TO THE MOTOROLA BUDS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! DEVICE ONE CONNECTED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! literally blasting in my ears when i turn them on and forget that the buds are still in my ears . No way to adjust that and it appears they want to be sure deaf people know the headset is active . Loud beeps when you adjust the volume , too . I m actually glad they 're dead because now I can replace them with a proper set and I was too cheap to do it while they still worked . Good riddance .
3 #### It kinda worked ... but the VCR has some years on it as well .
4 #### These have nice warm sound and are fairly loud . I use them on my acoustic and electro - acoustic guitars . They 're a bit hard on my fingers , and I have pretty darn tough fingers ( I practice at least 30min - 1hr every other day on electro / acoustic ) . Maybe I need to go lighter , but these give a bigger sound than lighter gauge strings . I 'm generally happy with them , but they do tend to bruise my fingertips more than my old brand .
5 #### I work on equipment that uses SF6 gas and this thing is very well Made and dependable . Very sensitive but adjustable , and is very nicely made .
5 #### I used this , along with two cans of the Dura ll flush solvent to clean the mineral oil out of my 84 K10 Suburban when I converted to R134a .
5 #### Bought this at a great price , it fits my camera with a lens attached , plus a second telezoom lens and the charger with extra battery and a micro tripod .
5 #### Great sound and fits perfectly on my Selmer S 80 C * mpc . And many other mouthpieces .
5 #### I installed this kit on my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited . Installation took quite a while ( several hours over three days ) , but I took my time and made sure everything was concealed and firmly connected . It worked the first time I tried it , though ! The kit is very complete -- there 's even more of the plastic wire tube than you need . ( When was the last time you bought a kit where there was not only enough to do the job , but * extra * ! ) The instructions were clear , and are presented in not only text but diagram form as well . All parts are of good quality . The lights are bright , and though I 'd love to have metal housings on them , the thermoplastic seems tough enough . ( These lights are water resistant , but not waterproof -- They'll handle storms and rain fine but are not for the back of your boat trailer . ) There 's even a small KC sticker included . I do recommend these -- you need a certain level of mechanical aptitude and a good block of time , but they are worth it .
5 #### This is a fantastic mic . The quality is superb . It you have a stronger voice this mic is perfect for you but if your going to be singing at quiet levels there are mics better suited for that . 10/10 will buy from shure from now on .
5 #### What an upgrade ! Upgraded to these from the junk H13 lights that come with my 2009 Jeep Wrangler . Used the KC Hilites 6307 conversion cable and these lights fit right in . Works like a charm and a HUGE lighting difference . Well worth it .
5 #### Works great . Put in an address for a museum that was 90 miles from my home . It took me to the front door even though we were forced to detour twice because of road closings in our path . When we turned off the course the Garmin recalculated in a few seconds with new directions to take . We use it all the time even in our city to find a new address we have not been to before .
1 #### I purchased this case as a package with the Palm TX from amazon . I wish I had read others reviews because as the others pointed out it does not fit the Palm TX . The top sticks out . I went to staples and bought the right case and was told the ones that fit the Palm TX have to say compatible with Tungsten T5 . So I m not sure why amazon has a deal with the Palm TX when it is n't the right case . Another thing is it does n't have a snap only a pull through strap which does n't stay put too good .
4 #### I bought these to mount on my tractors snowblower to help with visibility when it is dark out . The tractors lights are okay but do n't put out a lot of light . These light up my driveway great when I have to snowblow in the dark . Pretty good for the price .
5 #### Try this , you wo n't regret it ! Size would be the only con ... but then it 's far better than regular binoculars .
5 #### Got two sets to work on my 1998 Mercury Mountaineer and 2005 Mustang GT . These stands seem well built and I was n't hesitant to work below my vehicles while they were in place .
5 #### The itouch is perfect for me since I travel and do presentations . Its got a led pointer which is great for presentations and the battery also charges my iphone . What 's great is that it is a 3 - in-1 ( charger , flashlight and led pointer ) . The extra benefit is that it is compact and small eough to fit in my suit pocket . Great product ..
5 #### Awesome guitar strings the same strings are turkeys on his guitar I love the strings and they came in time I could n't be more happier thanks elixir
5 #### Just the right size . I 'm thinking of getting some more to keep in stock . I going to recommend it to all my friends .
5 #### I 've been transferring a lot of files between my desktop PC and my Macbook pro lately . Both computers are on my home network but for some reason , transferring between the two as they are is VERY slow . After countless failed attempts to fix the issue , I broke down and bought this crossover cable . At no fault of the cable , it took me awhile to overcome the challenges of creating an adhoc connection between a mac and a pc . However , once I figured out the settings , the cable worked great and the transfer speeds were awesome .
4 #### Good for a 3 hour show . Sound was great at the beginning but dulls out the longer you play . I change my strings for every show and at that price it 's not a bad deal . I 'll be getting some more .
5 #### this is a very good product . used it on the roof of a car and was easy to cut and fit .
5 #### The bulk strings are always a great value , as a guitar fabricator it makes it easy to manage during final assembly . The strings sometimes get twisted in the tubes but slow and easy they will work themselves free .
1 #### I have bought this brand for YEARS and been totally happy with every purchase . What they do n't tell you about this little charger is that if it is n't plugged in to an AC outlet it actually DRAWS power from your battery . The eyelet connections implies you can hook it up and plug it in when you need to and leave it connected to the battery . This is not the case . Had this on my generator battery and it charged perfectly . I unplugged the ac cord and left the charger connection attached to the battery . Came back 3 days later and the battery was completely dead . Used another charger to charge it again and noticed that the red light on the original charger illuminate ( it was not connected to ac at this point ) . When I pulled the other charger off the battery the light stayed on and began to discharge my battery again . If by " fully automatic " they mean it will automatically fully discharge your battery , then they are accurate . Very disappointed .
4 #### I like it but wish it fit better in my ear . It feels somewhat uncomfortable at times or falls out .
3 #### I would rate this higher but how you fold it up ( it rolls up ) causes the sides to bend inwards and it has issues staying up on your windows because of this . I found myself having to turn it backwards to get it to stay up . This is really the only complaint I have for this item as besides that it does a GREAT job at keeping the sun out , looks stylish , and feels of good quality build .
5 #### For the price , this is incredible .. and much faster than I thought it would be .. I 've watched youtube videos of it taking a while to display anything on the screen and a long boot process , etc .. but I instantly got a video signal / display and it started booting within 2 - 3 seconds of plugging it into a power source . So far , I am very impressed with this .. I 'm considering overclocking it to " turbo " mode and will add some good heatsink compound and copper heatsinks just to be on the safe side , as I will be putting this into a small case . My plan is to use it for an ambi - tv setup .
3 #### The sound is great but the ear coverings keep falling out ALL the time . Even just putting it in your ear and have it fall out . Lame lame lame ...
4 #### I have been using this holster for my Apple Iphone 3 G for almost a month . So far I am impressed with it 's quality . You may find it difficult to attach to your belt at the beginning but you will get used to it quickly . It keeps the Iphone well protected while it gives you easy access to pull the phone and put it back in place . This holster can store the Iphone with or without a shield . Good material and great look . It 's worth the money .
5 #### I got exactly what I thought i was getting . Brand new charger ! and the price was beyond awesome ! ! ! thank you
5 #### Item works exactly as described with no problems so far . The charger is exactly the same as the original that 'd you get from Barnes and Noble .
3 #### I already installed it on my 14 " snare drum . As soon as I tuned it , I realized it has a good sound and I got it for a good deal .
5 #### I had one ethernet internet cable coming in to my home theater but needed to hook up my DirectTv DVR and Samsung Blu Ray player . Worked like a charm . It has more slots than I needed but may hook the Wii console to the internet some day ..... if I figure out why ! Good product and with the $ 10 rebate it was a very cheap solution to my problem .
5 #### I bought this DVD from Amazon in November , have watched wellover 20 DVD 's ( see why later ) and played a lot of CDs . Nolip - sync . The CD sounds even better than my other CD deck . What I like most is the headphone jack that allows me to listen to CD and watch DVD just with the DVD machine powered on , without disturbing others . Now the best part ... that even Amazon staff does not know . This machine qualifies for 7 free DVDs and 33 free rental ( 10 from Netflix , 13 from Blockbuster via Sony coupon and 10 from Blockbuster 10/20 program ) . I waited until now to write this comment because I want to verify the above . I got all that . What can I say : outstanding picture , gorgeous sound ( I had a full 5 speakers sound system mated to a 5X100 Watts Dolby Digital , DTS receiver ) , and all the freebies listed above . You must be nut for buying any other DVD brand . After all , this is a Sony !
1 #### Did not work well for me , buy at your own risk . Was very delicate
5 #### I just want to say that this company has great customer service . Even though I made a mistake in my order they handled it as if it was their error and helped me out . I would definitely recommend purchaseing from this vendor .
4 #### Good Strings . I personally prefer Ernie Ball Earth wood guitar strings . To each their own . Its a very subjective thing .
4 #### For $ 10 .. what a deal . I write songs and play guitar and it 's handy to record the music ( at the moment ) . Sound quality as expected is mediochre . I did record a financial message from my speaker phone ( Panasonic ) handset . Very good . This alone justifies this recorder . I will have to record from this to a digital hand recorder to check out the quality . Digital is not everything ... but almost . lol
1 #### charged so slow and then died about a week later .
4 #### I tried BlueAnt Q1 which has amazing connectivety but low volume which is more evident on freeway . Jawbone Icon beats it easily . I highly recommend it . Sometimes , you have to restart the phone and Icon both because the call keeps getting routed to the phone automatically . Other than that , I did not notice any problems . It has awesome sound quality and is very loud . Caller I.D is a great feature .
5 #### I use the same brand in heavy tension for my violin and have for the last 16 years , and these did not disappoint in cello form . Good strings can make even the newest student instrument sound twice as expensive and warm .
5 #### This strap looks like the tape we used at crime scenes . I love it ! Very crisp and clear silk screening and stands out in a crowd to say the least ! The strap from LM Products is well built . The weave of the nylon is uniform and tight . Very solid leather ends that slip over the rather large strap buttons of the Strat that I intended to use it on with just enough pressure to be sure that it wo n't slip off the buttons while playing and moving around . Due to being a 2 " nylon design , it 's well suited to guitars of average weight . A Strat , Tele , SG ... that type . It would be pressing it to use on a Les Paul , known for it 's greater weight . But for lighter guitars ? Oh yea , it makes a statement to be sure ! The folks at LM offer a bunch of different designs , but this one caught my fancy . I love it !
4 #### I 've had or some time , and the sound has n't gone out in either end yet . Combined with its cheap price , I 'd highly recommend .
5 #### I received this cymbal as a Christmas present and I have to say ... WOW . This provides a very thin , trashy tone , and my goodness . It 's LOUD . great for blast beats , but I use it for accents in other styles of music as well . I 'm in a worship band and I 've been rolling it to give the " rolling thunder " effect . While I do n't have a lot of pricey stuff , I 've had the privilege of playing on some incredibly expensive cymbals . This Wigan 14 " China out - performs any cymbals in its class . the only China that even comes close is Zildjian 's 16 " Oriental China " Trash " , but that one costs $ 200 + . If you want great tone , great durably ( I 've beat the tar out of this this thing ) , stick with Wuhan , at least with their China line . You wo n't be sorry !
5 #### Very sturdy . Bought for my mother so that she would n't lose her phone . Still there :)
5 #### Just needed to replace another set of headset I had lost ! They are great sound producers !
5 #### This arrived in a timely fashion and worked as advertised .
4 #### I used this for my Father so he could control his pillow speaker control , which has no volume control . It 's been working perfectly for about a year now .
5 #### This case is very pretty . Snapped on very good and and even . I have a shield over the screen and it still fit perfectly with that applied . I recommend this
5 #### Excellent product . Had to mount outside on external pole about 15 feet high to gain best access possible to existing signal . Went immediately from a one bar to three bar and made a signal available within the entire house ( at least one bar 4G)- when prior was zero/ no signal in many areas . Power amplifier connection to the 75 ohm cable is very warm to touch . Other than that is excellent .
4 #### Very nice case for my new GPS fits very well and is very handy not just storing my GPS but to carry the GPS with protection .
3 #### These are ok to use but lack the ability to grip while turning . Tip : I placed a rubber band around the shaft several times to get a grip on it .
4 #### Overall , this is a very good item . It does just what I needed . It got my phone up high enough to be accessible and left space on the top and bottom to plug in power and audio . My case is one of the thicker ones , but it still fit with the larger " holder arms " . It feels very sturdy . The only real drawbacks are mostly things I was aware of and accepted . It does require a cup holder ( duh ! ) , which can be an annoyance in some cars . For example , I like to rest my elbow on the center console and my hand on the shifter . If the cup holder is between the two , the phone will be in the way . No big deal . In my main vehicle the cup holders are between the shifter and dash . I do wish it was a bit longer or had just a bit more flexibility . It only adjusts where the arm meets the " cradle " and where the arm meets the base , and both are very tough to adjust ( which does keep it more stable , most likely ) . On other thing is that it could do with some type of quick release from the base . If you want to get it out of the way , you have to take the whole thing out . Perhaps a button to release the arm and " cradle " from the base ? I still highly recommend this . Nothing is perfect for every situation or need , but this does a fantastic job .
4 #### This cymbal is very nice - has a very interesting crash sound and decay . I have many vintage Zildjian cymbals , and kind of prefer the older cymbals a bit more - they certainly are much heavier in weight in comparison to this particular cymbal and have a more clearly defined crash sound and longer decay .
5 #### This is a great product ! Can finally leave the windows down without the fear of rain . Look good on the truck too . Something needs to be said about Prime shipping , I got my items a day early !
2 #### The mirrors worked well for half my first trip ..... after that they started to sag . The mirrors are about half the size of my tacoma 's mirrors , so , they work but have a limited field of view . After 5 trips on these mirrors , the adjusting belts gave way when I tried to tighten them down . I will not be buying these again .
5 #### This synthetic drying chamois is like a water vacuum for drying your car . I had been using terry cloth and microfiber towels to no avail . This towel allowed for much quicker drying time ... which eliminated the water spots I would get from the others . Wash your own car ... this is a good investment . Get one !
5 #### I always used to clean my filters with water / soap , but K&N 99 - 5000 Aerosol Recharger Filter Care . made me change my mind . Very good product and easy to use . Gon na have it !
5 #### I put in this can about 2000 miles ago or 3 months ago and the a / c is still working properly . i think this can has resolved the slow leak i had in my a / c. A / C is still blowing cold air , i will update this review as time goes on . In the past the a / c needed to be recharged about every 2 months or about 1000 miles .
5 #### The best there is ... I will never buy anything else !
5 #### It fits both one and a half and two inch hitchs . Face is all metal and triple chrome plated , BEAUTIFUL It far exceeds the cheeper plastic cover it replaced . I 'm very happy with it but order a reveiver lock pin to keep it from being stolen . EXCELLENT PRODUCT , and I recommend for your RAM .
3 #### The GRX20 is very similar to the GS221 as they go for the same price , and use the same materials . The GRX20 has the typical tremolo , and pickups mounted on a pickguard , and the GS221 has a string through solid ( Saddle ) bridge , and pickups mounted in routed out pockets . I have both guitars , and the big difference I have noticed , is in the finger rash I get off of the GRX20 , and the well rounded fret ends that produce zero finger rash on the GS221 . Other differences are the great stain / body work you get on the GS221 , and the opaque paint jobs you get on the GRX20 . If you do n't need a tremolo , I would highly recommend you go with the GS221 at the same price .
5 #### Wow this is really some thing Asmyna BB8520CASKCA083 Slim and Durable Protective Cover for BlackBerry Curve 8520/8530/9300/9330 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Clear ( Wireless Phone Accessory ) man i tell you what this was way out there it did more than jest add looks more light gets to the camera witch makes for a much better inside photo or video its really nice
5 #### Have new tractor needed a quick easy inexpensive way to move trailers around property and this is exactly what the doctor ordered , easy install quick to move from one size to another size . Great set up .
5 #### I used this on a bass guitar with older strings and it made the strings brighter and more lively . I will try it on all of my guitars as it will prolong the life of most strings . I like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with . I use sections of t shirts to clean my strings and put them inside the packaging along with the cloth . This is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player .
5 #### I do n't have as much money as I do love for good sound . These are great for the price . I have used much more expensive headphones and been disappointed . A friend has Dre 's Beats , and they are very good . Using the Koss PortaPro on my mp3 player ( SanDisk Clip ) using the FLAC format blew me away . It is a better sound than on the $ 250.00 Beats on a stupidly expensive Ipod . No doubt the FLAC format has a lot to do with it , but I saved $ 400.00 over my friend and get very good sound . Very clear , great bass , at all volumes . I usually second guess any purchase I make ... happily , not this time !
5 #### I liked the item and the price very much and will order more as I use these up . Great price and service
4 #### I have two tube guitar amps that I run in stereo - and one had an awful hum that was incredibly irritating when playing at home . The HUM - X reduced it by about 90 % . There is still a very faint hum , but nothing like before . Not sure I understand why it is $ 60 ( thus -1 star ) , but it was worth it for me to get rid of the interference .
5 #### Just got this to replace and old Donnely 240 with a strange attachment point ( 2001 Subaru ) . Had to glue the new base as this comes with the GM / Ford standard one . To my [ pleasant ] surprise , the mirror itself is a ... Donnely 240 . Great value for the price .
5 #### For several years my brother had a similar ( though significantly less durable ) in - car trash bag . It was slightly larger but , not having the elastic top , simply spilled things if you filled it up . The velcro on the bottom also was n't " fold - over " like this . Not that I intend to try myself , but I 've seen liquid poured into these with little to NO leakage ! That 's wonderful ! Heaven forbid the idiot in the back seat throws an ALMOST empty soda in upside down ! lol I also got some comparably sized trash bag inserts that are held in by the elastic top band nicely ! This prevents ANY spilling and makes for easy disposal ! Tie the top , unvelcro the bottom , and slide out your sealed trash bag ! Works MUCH better than my plastic grocery bag hanging off one side of the shifter ! ( also does n't take up leg room in the passenger seat ! ) Excellent product , especially from the price !
5 #### This wiring harness was a perfect fit for my 98 Honda Civic Ex . I used to install my new JVC stereo after my factor stereo volume knob quit working . I used it in combination with the Metra 71 - 1720 reverse wiring harness . Connected all the wres , plugged the harnesses in and was able to install a new stereo , tuck the factory stereo down in the console behind the AC power plug and maintain my factory keyless entry .
4 #### It only does not get the 5 stars because it tends to slip off the belt . However it is a perfect protection / carrying case for the motorola Bluetooth ear piece .
5 #### I bought this to install on the air - filter box in a 90 Miata . I removed the box clean it , marked where i wanted to cut , then cut to fit , and place it in the outer surface . Just checked it recently and the back adhesive is holding well .
4 #### These headphones have a very sturdy build , they can fold up very nicely . Very lightweight , comfortable on your ears , and the cord is extra long of course . The screw on adapter does come with it , so you can plug it into the amp / peddle / switch / board jack . Nice for their price , though when you extend the headband , so it fits a larger head , the metal , and the wires that feed into it , look and feel like they could break at any moment , makes me question the life of these , though I will try to be extra careful , I 'm skeptical , a good 4/5 though so far .
1 #### Waste of money , fell off minutes after holding it on the glass waiting for it to dry
4 #### Best part of this case is the interior . Well constructed and should provide excellent protection . Outside , it seems a little less so . Not cheap , but not as carefully crafted . I need this for a medium scale ( 32 " ) jazz bass , and the neck support is just right .
4 #### This product does exactly as described & assist Apples 3rd generation where they fell short . One thing I would of liked addressed was the power option . Unfortunately one has to slide the iPod shuffle in / out to turn on / off the power . Would of been nice if power option on device , but not a big deal . Like being able to utilize any headphones with my shuffle & this allows that .
5 #### Do n't go to Costco and spend 2X the cost on the same product . I have a bunch of these now and the fit is perfect and the elastic band on the bottom that holds them is very strong .
1 #### The straps kept breaking very frustrating to use I was not impressed with this product I will not purchase again
5 #### absolutely love this thing ! rolls very easy , maybe even too easy , you can scoot around all day ! very comfortable , well worth the money . do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks on this one ! you will not regret it ! !
4 #### I only give this a 4 because of the style but my nephew absolutely loves the sound and the bass . Hey , that 's what counts .. He actually compared the sound to the beat brand , whatever that is and after looking up the price and found it was much lower I guess I did good .
5 #### These are the best guitar picks my last ones lasted for years
5 #### This thing will clean your car in ten seconds . Works very , very well .
4 #### This is acually a great case . It has protected my phone much better than the cheaper cases that I have tried out . Only down side that I see is that it adds quite a bit of bulk to the phone .
5 #### I have already rated this product multiple times and it keeps poping up again . It is great .
5 #### I liked this cover so much I got one in red and one in yellow . They are easy to get off and on . The colors are very vibrant . No phone buttons are obstructed in any way .
5 #### Just the quality you can always expect out of Martin . Nice playability and fantastic tone .
5 #### I am very pleased with this dock . It 's stylish and works excellent with my iPhone 4 . I have n't has any issues up to this point . As a matter of fact my phone seem to get better reception now ; this probably has nothing to do with dock , but the fact that the phone is upright instead of laying flat on my desk . I am NOT using the rubber guards for my iPhone 4 . I am using Sonix Snap Slim Case for iPhone 4 with 2 Screen Protectors ( which I am pleased with ) .
4 #### I love the way this covers the whole front of the phone ... instead of just the square ... but it does seem to scratch easy but also cleans up nicely as well
5 #### So far so good . e sprayed the cleaner on my filter and it got a lot of dirt and such off now in letting it dry then applying the oil .
5 #### This is a great product to soak in cold water and used to cool down very hot dogs . Holds the cold water well and allows it to transfer cooling relief to the dog . Also use to wipe down ears and foot pads and under the rear legs . ( Please do n't just drape it over the dog and leave it there as it will act as insulation and trap the heat in . )
5 #### Has n't blown use , I guess its working ? Fits my ANL fuse holder perfectly and provides a comfort knowing I 'm protected against shorts .
5 #### used this for a drum brake job wow it makes it easy to remove and install springs great little tool
1 #### I was really excited when I received this item . It appeared sharp looking , good fit and with all the reviews , I thought I was done shopping for an iPhone case . I am extremely disappointed ! ! This case does n't fit no matter what I do . I thought maybe I bought the wrong case , so I tried it on an iPhone 3 , 3 G , & 4 and it would not fit on any of them . I 've come to the conclusion that I 've wasted my money . The iPhone is flat , this cover is curvy . I do n't understand how anyone who left a review can say that this is a good product . I 'm mailing it back , and yes I 'm also expected to pay for the shipment to return it . The cost combined to have it shipped to me + the cost to send it back = more than the cost of the case itself . I 'm extremely disappointed .
2 #### I purchased this radio several years ago and found it to be a really fine performer . Excellent sw sensitivity , good am and excellent fm as well .... considering the ATS 909 's rather small size . Sound is quite good , too , for it 's size . And it 's got a fine assortment of settings / buttons for improved performance . The big problem was that it did n't hold up well over the long haul . Firstly , the numbers / letters on the buttons that I used most often rubbed off , including the silver paint underneath , and became totally illegible . Then , about a year and a half after purchase , the digital clock refused to hold the correct time . I had it repaired but the clock went bad once again a few months later . And lastly , the speaker went bad , giving only fuzzy , low fidelity sound . It 's now , essentially , unusable . Were it not for the abovementioned problems , I 'd rate it five stars . At the fairly high selling price of around $ 250 , the ATS 909 should hold up for a lot longer than it did . I guess that these days , quality and durability of most electronic goods just are n't as competent as they once were ..... sigh .
5 #### I love the television band on this radio . It is great when I have to take a shower each morning , not to miss the weather or the local news on the traffic situation . Great little radio for a good price .
1 #### This charger never worked , so it got thrown away pretty much right away . Thankfully I paid very little for it .
4 #### There is n't quite as much " Oooga " as I was hoping for , but still fun . We have a old golf cart we use the putts around the neighborhood - this is a fun ad - on .
5 #### These synthetic core strings give such a wonderful , warm , rich tone , even on a student level violin . Also , they 're made from a type of synthetic material that does n't react poorly when the weather changes , like some strings I 've used . They break in quickly , within hours , which is really nice too . If your instrument has a bright tone , these are a great choice for balancing everything out . fit full sized 4/4 size violin medium tension strings D string included with the DZ310A set is aluminum wound corrosion resistant packaging Made in the USA
5 #### This was a great deal and works really well . I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want 's a great deal at a great price !
5 #### Works well to keep my summer car protected in my garage over the winter months . Very light weight but does the job , easy to install and the elastic helps keep it in place .
5 #### Great gift for Father 's Day ! I bought this for my dad , and he uses it almost daily . He loves it ! Best gift ever for the person who can buy himself anything/ Best Father 's Day gift .
5 #### This cable works very well for sitting in my room and recording music . I 'm not too rough on it and I do n't plan on it either however . So for my purposes , I recommend it .
5 #### Great selection of sizes . They work fine , and seem strong .
4 #### Inexpensive & important to have in times if emergency & in today 's world ---who knows ! ! ! I am host I bought it to complete his kit ! HE fells safe with it & ultimately that is what counts ! ! !
3 #### Broke like all the rest of my headphones break . I must have bought ten types of headphones . They all break inside the wiring somewhere .
5 #### It does the job so far . Time will tell . Always wary of things shipped directly from Hong Kong . But for a little over $ 2 I 'm not going to get too upset If it does n't last long .
5 #### I 've been a plantronics girl for several years now and because I HATE holding a phone to my head , quality is a must . Sadly , I have a cat who thinks bluetooths taste good ( 6 of them to be exact ) and it was getting expensive .. so I decided to try out a less expensive cat toy this time around . I was pleasantly surprised to find a bluetooth which has such high quality for $ 22 ! It was very easy to pair with my Motorola Droid X and maintains a solid connection with no drops and no issues . I do n't get into all the voice commands but it does have them . It even worked * perfectly * with my dictating text messages , so it picks up voices quite well . I did n't hear any complaints from the people I talk to most often about background noise and they all know I constantly have to replace my bluetooths ( blueteeth ? ) so any problems with call quality would likely incur a comment . Battery life is really extremely good and it charges quickly . I would recommend this model highly and in fact , the reason I am here is to pick up another one as backup for the day I wake up and find out she 's shredded this one . :)
5 #### I ca n't believe how well these little beauties work for the money I spent . Bought them right before going to Europe and needed them as opera glasses . They were superb , for both my wife and I , with very different eyesight . Thank you Bushnell !
5 #### Great product , easy to install and very durable . Save the screen on my Evo 4 G many times .
4 #### I use in my 06 Mini Cooper and it cleans and quenches the seats thirst . I apply once a month .
5 #### I bought this to tote my POD HD500 around . It fits snugly , but well . The accessory pocket can fit the power supply and the plastic Line 6 expression pedal . The shoulder strap makes me feel important . it respects my arm 's desire for freedom of movement . My only qualm is that it 's Gator brand , and gators remind me Florida . I 'd rather just pretend that Florida did n't exist .
5 #### 10 ' length , well made , no surprises great value . I 'm always leary of cheap products but this met my expectations . Great value .
5 #### Nicely made strap , good leather . My only complaint is I wear my guitar up pretty high , and the adjusting loops end up on my back- not really annoying , but would rather have just strap there . However if you wear your guitar lower like most people , probably no issue . PS- Not affiliated with Levi 's , made in Canada , small company , all of which I like .
1 #### Beware : TOXIC . The box says ( on the bottom ) that ' State of California knows this product to contain chemicals which cause cancer ' , or to that effect . The Amazon listing , as with that for many such toxic products , fraudulently makes no mention of this . It 's hardly worth being poisoned to save a few bucks ; do not buy this toxic product !
5 #### Just as the description reads . Clear and no back ground noise . People on the other end of the line say it sounds like a land line phone ... very comfortable , most of the time I do n't know I have it on ....
5 #### Needed some wire wraps ( instead of wire ties ) to keep my bass guitar amp power cord and equipment cord(s ) in place while not in use . I tried some other brands and was more of a " pain " than help . Seen this at Amazon and it could n't work better . Easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed . Get price too even if it is an " Add - On Item " . Thanks : )
4 #### The light strings snap easy if you over tune . But they sound amazing & they give you 2 extra packs which is nice !
5 #### The oak wood gives it a nicer look than the black plastic ones you can buy . Well built , good quality , easy to mount on the wall .
5 #### Wonderful product . Excelled all expectations . Immediate communication and rapid delivery . AAA+++
3 #### had too many scratch mark .DDD D D D D D DDDDDD DD DDD DDD DDD DD DDD D D D DDD DDD DDD DDD DDD DDD D DDD D D D D D D D D D
1 #### Update : Does n't work anymore , sad thing is I recommended this crap to friends and everyone has the same exact problem , it works the first time you pickup and does n't work after that , known issue if you search Motorola forums , they should fix the problem or refund everyones money , I think a class action lawsuit is in order ! Before it stopped working : Excellent clarity , ease of use , battery life and caller i d. I can now drive my manual transmission without holding the phone up to my face with one hand so I can hear the other person and the other person can hear me ( even by doing this the sound quality was still horrible ) . People on the other end ca n't even tell I have them on speaker when I 'm on the Moto T325 .
3 #### Adequate but not easy to use as it requires both hands to use which in some cases is tough .
5 #### Purchased for a label printer for my office . It works well . I have had no problems with it .
5 #### This is what all the pro 's use . I just bought a boat that had one side completely trashed from rubbing on dock fenders for years . After wet sanding 600 and 1000 grit , this really brought out the shine . Looks like brand new .
5 #### Looks fantastic and so far holding up just fine , heavy and durable .
1 #### Terrible Unit . magnet not strong enough for Iphone 4s . Ended up buying a differnt model for 25 bucks that connects to your cd player slot and that one is amazing .
4 #### highly recommended . it works perfectly so that i do n't have to learn but 3 or 4 chords and play bunches of songs . that makes me so happy after tying since 1966 to learn 3 chords . it 's something to look forward to
5 #### Years ago I picked up a gibson pick with this profile and I always liked it because its large size made it easy to hold , and the symmetry meant I could n't pick it up wrong . It took me a lot of searching to find these on amazon , but I finally did , and since I have two Fenders and no Gibsons now , I 'm happy that they 're Fenders , too .
3 #### We have two Droid X 's ; along with this one , I also ordered the " Black Rubberized Snap - On Protector for Motorola DROID X Xtreme MB810 ( Verizon ) " [ ... ] . Because with shipping , ordering both only came to [ ... ] , I figured why not . As it turns out , both products are exactly the same ; they came together in the same box with the same model number on the plastic packages from the same company , Eforcity . One of them fit the Droid X perfectly , the other does not fit so well , it 's loose on one corner and getting worse after a week 's use . I would say it may be hit or miss when buying these products . The problem is that with this price , it 's not worth the time and trouble trying to return them . Still , I did get one good one for [ ... ] , so not a bad deal in the end .
1 #### I am so pissed off . I purchased this memory card for my phone to find out that it do n't work . I tried it on 3 different phones and it 's not readable . I 'm returning this item . So disappointed , such a waist of money .
1 #### This item was not unlocked as listed as a description according to 3 different carriers . Also received only a charging cord not a plug .
1 #### The case is too small for the HTC EVO 4 g , and does not meed the size requirements for the EVO 4G. I was excited when I originally purchased it so I bought several in black and brown . Bad idea . Do Not buy this model for your HTC EVO 4 G , the case is too small
5 #### Works great for car windshields , the rubber is curved so it works great on the glass . The only problem I have with it is that it is a bit short , but I do recommendt it
5 #### This headset is used by most of our drivers , it work very well , light weigh and cuts out all the truck noise so you get a clear voice sound , going out an coming in .
5 #### I 've used POR , and its okay . Eventually it rusts , its better than nothing , but its not some magic silver bullet for rust . This stuff is . I painted crappy rusty metal on a 69 chevelle , let it sit in a shed for two years , and it looked absolutely perfect . There was no blossoming of rust , nothing . It was perfect . This paint is tough , super strong , sticks to damn near everything ( hands included , so watch out ) , it looks sharp , and if you paint it on nicely , it evens itself out very well . Expensive , but if you have something you are going to paint , and you 're not sure if you got all the rust off of it , paint it with this first . If you have to be sure , and you do n't want to do it again , this is the best stuff I 've seen . The six shooter is great too , because one little can goes a long way . Its not like you 're painting your house with this stuff . Its expensive , so its nice to not have one big can go bad when you only use half of it .
5 #### These LCD screen protectors for the D5000 install very easily . There is some work involved and you must make sure the screen is clean , but otherwise , these go on a lot easier and do n't accumulate bubbles as easily like the ones you buy from walmart that you have to pre cut yourself . Overall , satisfied .
5 #### excellent ! ! ! ! ! WAY BETTER THAN THE TAMA which just gives you random readings
5 #### Did n't fit my phone but they gave me a full refund .
2 #### I was n't expecting much from this due to the cost , but I wanted to really like it because the design is great . I put it on my LP Gothic and it 's just ... stiff . I have adjusted it , and the crease from where it was when it was sent has stayed . I primarily play in a seated position , and it can get in my way . Hopefully it will break in with time .
3 #### Still trying to find a way to use it without needing a contract with a monthly fee . Seller gave me some good tips so I 'll wait and see if they work . Update later .
5 #### I have been trying to find replacement tape for my device for quite awhile . Also I needed an adapter instead of using batteries all the time . I was able to satisfy both with this purchase . I am well satisfied with the tape ( Clear and White backgrounds ) . Great products .
4 #### Got several of these for home use after seeing that these are the approved units in our office . They work great and look great . Wish they had a couple of USB ports , but that is the only real improvement I would suggest .
5 #### Absolutely the best , great lighs in my 2009 Malibu and Lexes ES-350
4 #### Rolls easily on hard packed roadbase or dirt even over the occasional loose rock on concrete or pavement . If the wheels were wider you could roll on softer dirt if needed .
3 #### I have been trying different light weight steel ( vs nylon ) strings on my Takamine acoustic , and got around to this Martin Marquis set . Sound was pretty good at first , but only a few weeks in and they already sound rather dead , lacking a nice ring or sustain . Prior D'Addario and Ernie Ball Extra Slinky sets lasted longer .
5 #### I own two pairs of these headphones and gave my son a 3rd pair for Christmas . Great sound , lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores . Unlike earbuds , they stay in place . They are not indestructible- if you accidentally step on them , you will break them . But they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tear . Highly recommended .
5 #### Good Deal . Shipped promptly and worked perfectly . Never had an issue with any Belkin product .
4 #### Nice sound ... A little dull sounding though . Lasted about 2 months and rarely went out of tune . Mike
5 #### Works perfect if you know how to use it YouTube videos may help does n't come with instructions but works perfect
5 #### Adjustable for a variety of tire sizes , fits tightly , and is reasonably cheap .
5 #### When I purchased this wire I did n't realize it was a Monster product and so I was pleasantly surprised after opening the package . I 've used Monster XP speaker wire in my home theater for many years , but this is the first time I had a need for flat wire . I was installing rear surround speakers using a Rocketfish wireless system and wanted minimal wire exposure . This very high quality wire and pins . Very easy to work with and it 's vanilla or off white color makes it very unobtrusive . I would buy this again .
4 #### Really liked this book . It is rare to find an emotional yet fast paced free book . Very well written so much so that I could see things as I read them .
5 #### sound great on my ej-200 ce and on my taylor they last forever great deal
5 #### Clamps work well and are built tough . Rated to hold 165lbs but I use it to hold LED bars or my Swarm FX5 which are less then half that . Once locked on they do n't move !
1 #### DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ! ! I do n't care what anyone says , this does not work ! ! What a gimmic ! !
5 #### this product gives you the possibility of using a great eq control and it performs miracles in your tone . Really great
4 #### tinny and brassy sound . not what i was hoping for , but it may yet be good :) strings feel nice though !
5 #### I bought and gave the Wilson booster to an elderly friend who lives alone in a remote trailer on a large cattle ranch in East Central Texas . His only contact with the outside world is via cell phone , and prior to installation of the Wilson it was very difficult for him to be able to make or receive calls from inside the trailer . After installation , he gets full bars on his Verizon phone from inside .
5 #### Your standard 72 pack of .73 mm Dunlop picks , much cheaper than buying a couple 12 packs . Not too thick but not too thin . I found the oranges to not be resistant enough . Greens are alright , but sometimes too thick . Yellows seem to be just right . Took the free shipping & handling and it took about a week to arrive , not bad . Gon na hand these out to my students in Iraq since one pick there costs roughly a buck , or 1,000 Dinars .
5 #### You could drown someone with this , and they 'd thank you because it feels so good . I wo n't admit I took out the flow restricter , but I took out the flow restrictor and am thinking about putting it back in . I like long showers and before this I could not run my 80 gallon water heater out of hot water taking a shower . With the flow restrictor out and my other shower head going , I can run it out , so either I need to run one or the other , shorten my showers , or put the restrictor in and see how well it works with 2.5 gallons a minute . It is n't as classy looking as many of the shower heads I 've looked at or owned , but damn .... it feels good . Excellent coverage and just drenches you like a warm monsoon storm .
5 #### Best Portable Headphones I heard it has Good Bass But little overpowered the high is fine and , mid as well one con for people who go outside this " THE PORTAPRO MAY LEAK DUE OF IS SEMI OPEN HEADPHONE MEANING IF YOU SET YOUR VOLUME TO HIGH THEY CAN HEAR YOU ALSO YOU CAN HEAR THE ENVIRONMENT IF YOUR IN A NOISY ENVIRONMENT THIS HEADPHONES IS NOT THE CHOOSE FOR YOU UNLESS YOU CAN GET USE TO IT OR YOU LIVE IN MORE CLAM QUIT SUCH AS YOUR HOME . Over all this Headphone is good under 30 or more 33 bucks .
3 #### I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick . My guitar would probably not be happy without it .
1 #### Call me native but I did not expect for it to cause the phone to heat up so much . After , about 10 minutes of phone activity the phone was noticeably hotter . The cutout for the micro - usb was a little small to solidly connect the Samsung OEM usb cable . It needs a small amount of trimming so the cable can sit flush against the phone . Overall , for the price being charged I knew I could n't expect much . Coming for an Otterbox Defender case for my other phone , the DuoSuit provides on the minimumal protection against bumps and low - level drops . But considering the Galaxy Note is such a large , thin phone I will be surprised if any cases will be able to provide adequate protection .
5 #### Appear to be just what I needed but I have n't used them yet .
5 #### For no reason in particular I 've always bought SanDisk mico - SD cards for my phones and , most recently , my Dell Venue Pro tablet . I 've never had a problem with any of them . My most recent purchase arrived quickly and was recognized immediately by the tablet , so again no complaints .
5 #### I bought this to hopefully remove a very audible hissing sound from an HTC EVO V phone . The hiss could be heard easily when I was playing mp3 files regardless of which pair of earbuds I used . I inserted my earbud plug into the the Koss VC20 and then plugged the VC20 into my phone . After turning the volume on my phone up and the volume on the VC20 down , I was thrilled to find that the hiss was no longer audible . I noticed no degradation in sound quality ( same bass and treble levels , for example ) when using the VC20 versus not using it . The gadget is lightweight and offers excellent control over sound volume . Well worth the price ! !
5 #### Nice switch . Worked as indicated and virtually no set up .
5 #### Decent price for mechanical oil pressure , nice clean look to gauge , comes with everything you need to connect to your engine to monitor oil pressure .
2 #### They are very big in size , on the picture they seem a lot smaller . I did n't wanted to bother with sending them back , so I 've used just strap button with rubber ring . I ca n't imagine that I would use this lock as intended - it 's too bulky and ugly for my taste .
5 #### Peace of mind using this brand and style of filter for my 2000 Ford Explorer which I have always run synthetic oil in . Easy on / off with grippy end .
5 #### Just as I had hope . Easy to put on you 're bass . And they sound amazing ! Would check them out if you 're getting new string 's !
3 #### The speakers come out very easily from that locked position . Little dissatisfied
5 #### Awesome . Going to use this between my bluetooth transmitter and my bluetooth light bulbs .
5 #### I was worried that the cord length would not be long enough and this would end up hanging from my cigarette lighter , but no worries . The cord is long enough to reach under my seat and keep all to charging wires out of site ; over 2 feet long , just like it says . The only drawback buyers should be aware of is , although it has 2 usb ports , if you are charging an IPhone the instruction say not to use the 2nd usb port at the same time . I do n't have an IPhone so I do n't care . If I did I would be worried about whether or not I could use the lither ports at the same time as charging the IPhone . The instructions do n't say you ca n't but I do wonder . Other than that this is a great product , and perfect for me .
4 #### Had a stripped out exhaust manifold bolt hole in my dirt bike , Using this kit I was able to drill it out and retain the factory size header mounting bolt .
5 #### The product seems to work , I have less finger pain when playing .
5 #### I purchased this flash for my G9 , but now use it with all my EOS SLR 's also . This week I used my expensive 580 for class pictures and ebay photography with dismal results . I switched the 2nd day to this little baby and the class pictures were perfect . I was amazed ! Eliminated redeye with the G9 and perfect for many uses .
4 #### It was really cheap and shipped quickly . Not too much that you can say about a cable except that it works . I needed a second one and this one did the trick .
4 #### Used this in my 2005 Tundra for a few months . It is ok for what it 's intended to do , which is be a lightweight cargo divider . You have to make sure you do n't ratchet this thing down too hard , if you do , you will regret that last click . Might break a weld on the inside of your bed . This thing was a steal for $ 25 and free shipping .
1 #### I 'm updating my earlier review . I had first gotten this keyboard cover a while back and absolutely loved it . It fit perfectly and protected the keys from dust , etc . It was definitely easier to type with it on the keyboard , my fingers gripped better . But after a while , it started poking up a little in the middle of the cover , so I ordered a couple more covers from the same seller . The first shipment sent the wrong covers , for different keyboard . I informed the seller , and he was great -- told me to keep those and sent me a new pair . The new covers fit the keyboard , but the outer edges of the cover are essentially gone - cut almost up against the keys . Which means that the cover no longer goes down to the keyboard . Any dust , dirt , etc . will get to the keyboard around the edges . The original , first cover I 'd gotten from this seller is like the covers that are pictured . It has wider outer edges that reach the keyboard and prevents any dust or debris from getting to the keyboard . These new covers are essentially useless since they no longer protect the keyboard . I 'll revise my review if I learn / see that the covers have gone back to the old design that actually does the job .
1 #### I got this lens with my camera almost 2 years ago . However there is nothing much I like about it . The images it takes are not crystal clear and for some reason the rubber grip around the lens is falling apart unlike my other one . I want a good lens that takes sharp pictures , not this . I only use it if I see something interesting in the distance and I really want it . Either then that I barely use it .
3 #### Not that these headphones are the ones you are going to take to the lonely island , but for what I payed , I feel satisfied .
5 #### I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1 , because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing , and 2 because they are super smooth . It 's like playing a silk guitar . Get these strings .
5 #### Worked great in the garmin . NowIcan download the entire US
5 #### So far so good . I have never been let down by an Anker product . Plug it in . Plug in your phone or tablet . Charging happens ... Fast . Not only that , but it fits in the lighter slot ( even though it has no lighter ! ) perfectly which others tend to slide out of . Good stuff . Works . Worth the money . Jump on it .
1 #### I followed all the direction to setup this device and nothing works . I tired on PC and Mac . You will have to contact AT&T , and get the service enabled for a fee .
3 #### I have 20/20 vision but ca n't adjust these so things are perfectly in focus . I have the adjuster on the side maxed out . Also , when looking through these , the outsides of the image are blurry / fuzzy , only the center is in focus .
4 #### Very good value . Strong bass , good high response , warmish sound . Absolutely no isolation . Because of this , it does leak a bit , but it 's not very noticable from more than a foot / 1/3 meter away unless you like to crank the volume .
5 #### I could only see a snow screen on my VCR . Now it 's like new ! ! I went with the wet cleaner since it looks like that is the best way to clean it if you have big problems .
5 #### They 're great - they work as advertised and are of a consistent good quality . The generous assortment is great to have around for those unplanned moments when you ask yourself " how am I going to do _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " or " how am I going to secure _ _ _ _ _ _ " . To me , this goes right in the cabinet next to the duct tape .
5 #### The tension on these strings very light ! Ca n't play hard or you will buzz . They have a good sound if you like to play very soft . They last very long too ! EXP with NY Steel .
5 #### Toggle tip , great quality perfect color perfect fit . Perfect product for your Gibson !
5 #### I love the trashiness of this China ! Hard to believe it 's only a 12inch but it 's sounds pretty powerful . I like it ! Get one .
4 #### My husband and I use these all the time on our iPads and we are satisfied even though they are a little large for my head .
5 #### I 've always loved the tele twang . I mainly play bass or acoustic , never really bought myself an electric til now . I 'm in love with this guitar Right out of the box I knew it needed a setup . The guitar 's action was okay but intonation was way off . I got her setup and even threw in the fender original pickups while I was at it and boom . Pretty dang baller for about 300 in total costs .
5 #### Everyone loves kazoos . These are great . I have my entire office playing these
5 #### The charger is a step up from the one I was using to charge the genset crank battery , This one is rated at 900mA and when I do the math for the charge rate on an AGM assembly , 900mA is right on the money .
2 #### I bought it for my classic guitar but it 's too small for it . I guess it 's only acoustic guitar .
4 #### No label on charger , no indication of output . Works , but I suspect it charges below 2 amps . Do not keep up with high drain apps such as the GPS or using real time navigation app .
5 #### Did not take very long to cut the tabs to fit and looks great now that it 's installed . No complaints !
5 #### Goes great on my acoustic and makes it easier to play .
5 #### Great product that works as intended . It takes all the play out between the hitch and ball mount .
5 #### Been using these for over a decade . Like the phos / bronze a bit better ... not quite as bright . I use these on several acoustics - Maton 808TE , Gibson J-45 and Martin ooo-28EC ... I tune them all down a half step so I find that using the medium gauge string in this configuration maintains the proper intonation and playing pressure as if I were using a custom light string tuned standard . I gig a couple times a month and play almost daily and these strings last over a month easily . I usually change them every month just because but I 'm sure I could go a couple months - maybe three easily without anyone noticing but me .
5 #### Okay , here 's the deal . This does not provide nearly the dampening of a large pillow . But , that 's part of the point . It stops the ringing while allowing the tone to come out , long enough to get a more natural sound . If you like a thump , then go with a pillow . This can also be adjusted to put more pressure on the batter head to deaden the sound even more . I use this in a Pearl Rhythm Traveler with a 16 " kick , and it is perfect for that ! My studio kit ( Peavey Radial Pro 1000 ) is very boomy , so I switch out with a pillow per application . It depends on the sound I 'm going for at the moment . I would recommend having one , even if you need to swap it out every once in a while . The design is where it counts the most . Look at some YouTube videos to see how it works before just shoving it into the drum .
5 #### Great sound and ear protection , while at the same time having the ability to listen to music so you can play along and still hear your drums as you play along , or just use them on their own to protect your ears . It 's a bit bulky , and fits tight to your head , but they 're still comfortable .
5 #### As you know Zakk 's old gear were Boss pedals , he used to play with the SD-1 Super Overdrive . I compared both pedals and this one from MXR is better , you get less noice into the signal and a great tone and sustaine from it . The only thing I can say the SD-1 is better is the quality of the switch and the stompbox .
5 #### Put it in the firewall of my car to protect from the new headers I 've installed . They do the job very well , the adhesive is really good .
5 #### Excellent looking piece , hope it holds up as good . Fast shipping ............
4 #### i bought some load bars used that did not included the end caps , so i had to purchase these off amazon . they fit perfectly and do their job , but some pieces of rubber should not cost $ 9 =(
5 #### I have not actually used them yet but I must say for appearance and physical feel I must just say WOW ! They look great and feel very substantial compared to my old Warn ones that I have now .
1 #### Does n't last . Turn to rags in less than a year . I would think they could use better material . But then , it was inexpensive . Tried two of them in case it was a fluke , but the second one wore out faster than the first one .
5 #### Great sound . Good bass . You can hear things I did n't hear before on some music ( specific back - up vocals , instruments , etc . ) I would recommend getting an portable headphone amplifier if you 're using a phone or MP3 player because it does n't get that loud for me . It works great on a Mac or PC .
5 #### Good quality . It was a great price for it . A + + + + + + + + + +
3 #### I bought this 5 years ago from Amazon . I use it at home and once - in - awhile gigs . I ve used music stands since I was 8 years old I 'm 41 yrs now . The pictures show the cheap plastic breaking apart . It happened 6 months ago but it finally broke to where its non - functional . Sure , 5 - 6 years of having it but not using it professionally . I do n't abuse instruments or equipment . There s also the plastic piece shown in my pics that always falls out that stops the bolt from denting the tube frame . I ve seen the newer model & it appears in the photos this problem was fixed . However , the joints remain plastic . I m going to the hardware store to buy a 3 way pvc schedule 30 or better piece . I m guessing I can make a new joint for $ 10 I do n't think I d buy this again & I definitely would nt use it for weekly shows .
4 #### Works as expected . Bought it because of the price . It is small and that makes it easy to keep in the car at all times . It does n't stick very far out of the outlet and you can charge two things at once .
5 #### I 've actually bought a couple of these over the past 2 years . Mine finally broke after 2 years and I dug out my wife 's unused 510 as a replacement . Tried a Jawbone 2 and it just did n't work properly with my Microsoft Voice Command software - must be something to do with the delays in noise reduction . Also could n't get the thing to stay in my ear . For some reason , this one had tons of problems with background noise and essentially was unusable in the car . So just now I called Plantronics and they offered to ship me a new one , no problem . So even though the product is great the service is even better . I was so shocked by the spectacular service even though the headset in question was well over a year old and sitting in a drawer . If you 've had problems with fit on other headsets , try this one . It 's magic .
4 #### it 's made of plastic , which might make you wonder . However , I tried it on my boat today , and it worked 100x better than the 12 volt extractor I used for a few years . Silent too ! I was really surprised at the amount of suction it gets . Once I got the hang of it I found it was easiest to get suction going with 10 or so pumps and then every 10 seconds or so give it another pump to keep it flowing at maximum . Sucked all the oil out with no problem . And unlike the my previous one , not a drop of oil was spilled because it pumps straight into the container ! Definitely recommend it to anyone that is performing the occasional maintenance .
5 #### Still good . Nice response with open phones for studio work .
5 #### I connected my brother printer with this wire to my laptops and computer . It works flawlessly . The 10 feet wire length is useful to position my printer far away from my computer and hence desk saving space over and below it .
4 #### I bought this cute model by eBay two months ago for my 9 year old daughter , and is excellent cellphone controlled by parents , She can just call the list of people I add to the contact list + 911 . It has excellent reception with AT&T ( h2o wireless pre - pay ) $ 10 every 90 days . Good for my budget too .
5 #### I do n't know if they still come with a lifetime warranty but I 'd buy them over again even if they did n't . It 's hard to find a pair of in - ear headphones that are rated 16 to 23,000 Hz . And if my memory serves me correctly , this design was groundbreaking and every one else copied them . I 've always enjoyed the isolating aspect as well as the bass response from them . I 've used the lifetime warranty a few times over the last 10 years and have had no problems .
5 #### Finally a surge protector you can use every outlet without having to skip over one or two because of transform plugs
5 #### If you really do n't like your electric guitar strings rusting , get these . They last much much longer than regular strings with no coating . The coating does not interfere with the feel or my playing in any undesirable way . Maybe they feel slightly slicker than a normal string - but I 'm not sure since I wo n't use any other kind of string anymore .
5 #### Great Tone , Great Price . Elixirs are the best Strings I have ever used so far . Their nice tone lasts and lasts and lasts ....
5 #### Bought the stand to hold an electric guitar . It is adjustable to fit different size guitars and it can go smaller to put away easily . Great addition to any guitar collection whether it is one guitar or you have a collection to display .
5 #### Quality 5 star , ease of use 5 star , delivery as promised 5 stars , using it on a regular basis . will buy again if needed .
3 #### Bought it for my Android phone .. got tired of having it in my pocket and thought this pouch would be the solution . Well , it works pretty good . It has 3 holders ( 2 for a belt and 1 clip ) . The clip is strong and firm but it did n't last with me more than 2 weeks . Took a lot of abuse and even thou the clip still works it became dislodged from the pouch and now i use it with the 2 belt holders . So far , so good . I recommend this pouch .. just do n't abuse the clip and you 're all set .
3 #### I bought these to try on my classical instead of nylon . They turned out to be not as good . However they turned out to be very balanced , sound wise , with no one string overpowering the others .
5 #### I prefer this kit to the other one on Amazon . This one has plenty of screws for a vent installation and plenty of butyl tape as well . It worked great for our purposes and I 'm happy with the purchase .
4 #### Arrived very fast , and product is as described . Would gladly buy again from this seller !
5 #### Had the old stamped one and was upgrading all the chrome some I put one of these on . They work perfect and look good . You get 2 in package ( with screws ) so I have a spare . Update I only had one on E / B but went ahead and added one for G / D. Works and look great ! ! ! google " stratocaster string tree placement " if you are unsure of where and how to install .
1 #### Did n't find much use for these after getting them . It is easier to " take your time " and punch the numbers than to use these things . They were useless to me after getting them , so I gave them all away .
4 #### The film is excellent becuase it is Fuji Film , however , the company is promoting the film as Super HQ Speed and it is not . It is regular 200 speed film when it arrives . I was given a full refund and was told to keep the product .
5 #### had before worked great have not used this one as yet
3 #### works great hard to put on cause the instructions were messed up but it works great no scratches
3 #### had hard time using it , had to format every time it was being used
4 #### Had the product for only a day so durability is not part of my rating . Setup is pretty easy , just plug in your cables , and plug it in . It appears to be fanless ( at least I ca n't hear a fan ) , and the power supply is internal ( no brick ) . Speeds are Gigabit range from my informal file transfer tests . I am knocking one star off for the lack of documentation . The only aggravation I have is that there is a switch on the bottom that is labled EEE+ that is not mentioned in the documentation . After a bit of Googling I found some promotional materials for the device that seem ot indicate that this turns off some of the green power saving features . Delivery was silly fast , got it the next day using Amazon prime free shipping option .
4 #### I had ordered another case & holster & was quite dissappointed . Had heard many positive comments about the OtterBox Defender with Holster , so I bought it . I am very happy with it . Of course , it adds some weight & bulk , but small price to pay for protection . The holster has operated well allowing me to insert the phone facing out or in and providing an easy , secure & handy way to keep it with me at all times . The only slight drawback is that the film covering does not fit firmly against the keys contributing to errors in typing sometimes . ( But I 'm not a perfect typist anyway ) All said , I would n't give it up & would buy it again in a minute if ii was necessasy .
5 #### Heavy duty construction will hold hoods up whether the lift dampers work or not ! Even if they 're not there at all or you are replacing them . The press locks grip instantly , and the radiator support end of the prop has a large rubber knob tip to grip . I put the prop in a decent crevice and wedge it in and it ai n't going anywhere ... unless the mechanic bumps it real good when he 's working ! ! Another selling point : USA manufactured product ( at least the one I got was ) . Okay that 's it .... So prop it up and ... play away under your favorite tree this Saturday ... and this part of it at least ... will be made in the shade
5 #### It came on time and it fits perfectly . Good purchase .
5 #### I bought this to plug in my portable HP POCKET MEDIA DRIVE . It did not work on the drive so I hooked it up to my printer and it worked fine . I had to connect a 6 ft . cable to my HO POCKECT DRIVE and then it worked fine and my computer reconized fine .
5 #### This duster is the best . We have lots of hard wood floors and it works great . I would buy one again ! !
3 #### I had this for one day Samsung Transform Ultra - with a rubber case PROS : This stand fits really good with my Transform , with the rubber case . The rubber / non - slipping padding on the bottom the other areas that touch the cellphone is a GREAT attribute . For $ 13 its well worth it . Plastic seems sturdy , not too thin . This stand is compatible with a lot of phones , just compare our phone 's measurement with the motorola droid ; that s how I bought this . Cons : No universal or any input for power cable(if there 's such a thing .. maybe i should invent one .. lol ) . The back support is not adjustable . I recommend this product to anyone . For the reviewer who was wining about the right angle adapter , that 's the reason this stand is cheaper . Nothing more annoying , un - useful review .
5 #### Excellent product for leather goods ! Good add on price also !
1 #### Hard to use & it cracked while putting it on .... it was cheap , but save your money
4 #### Amazing strings , they last longer feel better on the bends than any other . They have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound .
1 #### Incorrect item so frustrated . Thought I picked the right item
5 #### This product really works . I 'm doing a lot of camping in remote location and the biggest problem is the Internet . I have Verizon and in the past 2 weeks I was in 2 different locations , NY Catskills and NH White Mountains . I was very surprised before I had 2 bars- 3 g on my phone and on rt 16 in White Mountains around Mt. Washington I had no service , zero bars . With this tool is got 4 g - 1 bar , I was able to Skype in the middle of nowhere
5 #### This is the most useful book on Lion I have found after 7 months on a new macbook pro . I have read many of the other intermediate level lion books and found them wanting . Ray 's Lion covers the useful stuff without losing you in detail , humorous side journeys , rush - to - press errors , or leaving out essentials . If I upgrade to Mountain Lion in 6 months , I will buy Ray 's book on that . Other os x books that have helped me switch back from Windows are : Iwork 09 portable genius for Pages and Numbers&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/iWork-09 - Portable - Genius / dp/0470475420 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">iWork ' 09 Portable Genius</a > ; Iphoto 11 missing manual ( but I am buying Jim Heid 's iphoto 11 for review)&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/iPhoto-11 - The - Macintosh - iLife - Guide - to - using - iPhoto - with - OS - X - Lion - and - iCloud / dp/0321819519 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">iPhoto ' 11 : The Macintosh iLife Guide to using iPhoto with OS X Lion and iCloud</a > ; ipod missing manual which covers the touch . I need books that accurately cover what most users NEED to know for effective use . Anything else is fluff or dangerous errors .
2 #### Tried it many years ago . Hoped it would have improved . Did half the windshield . When driving under street lights at night in a light rain , the RAIN - x half looked foggy , and the untreated half was clearer .
5 #### What more can I say , but this is the best guitar cable I have ever used . If you are serious about live performances buy this cable ... you wo n't be dissappointed .
3 #### This protector is too rigid and it 's impossible to apply it without getting air bubbles . Do n't buy this stuff .
5 #### These are very well made maintainers and are set up to protect from electrolisis because it will not work unless both common and ground are connected . Will not work with hot and common only . needs all three .
3 #### This product commits more than 8 hours of battery usage , but it starts draining in 4 hours of usage . But its really awesome product .
4 #### Moves easily . A little thick as you go up the frets .
4 #### I like it , especially for the price . I had purchased a cable at Wal - Mart for about the same price , took it home , opened the package and it was a piece of crap . It looked like the connector would break off , after I 'd unhooked it from my laptop 4 or 5 times . This one I saw on Amazon is FIVE TIMES BETTER . Nice design , nice weight , does what I need . It does have a different type of connector that hooks to the computer . You put your finger kind of in the center of the connector to detach it . At first , I thought it was kind of weird , because of the wings , but it 's great , because it really protects your actual plastic connector from breaking or bending . Thumbs up on the design .
5 #### item arrived quickly after a few days to CA . I got a size B for a 99 accord lx 4 door . nice fit with ample string and one needle . i chose to use a cross stitch so i used two needles , be warned installation is time consuming . i took a total of 3 hours . instructions are included and adequate . effort though is worth it . really recommend doing a cross stitch , looks better going around the steering wheel braces . every for holes i would tighten the stitches and apply a ziptie . very nice to hold the tension . nway this is soo much better than a tacky slip on cover , feels nice and looks it will last the remainder of the life of the car . good buy
5 #### This is a very nice Mixer , for the price this ca nt be beat , what I like is the effects , you can tweek the mixer , along with the small equalizer , which I run through a large equalizer , sounds awsome , love it ! defently recommend this unit , works perfect nice size too UPDATE ... 10/2/2015 . I have had this mixer for a year and it still works great ! i will tell you this , this mixer adds depth , it brings music to life , I run i pods through it , along with mini disc , then running mics through it sounds wonderful , special effects really makes this thing rock ! so much you can do with it , fun toy to play with .
5 #### No joke , this speakerphone is awesome . I do n't know why some have had negative comments , perhaps they have not used many speakerphones to know how hard it is to find a good one when they finally get one . This is by far the best I have used and for what it cost it is an incredible value . None of them are perfect but this one is close . I have had mine for 9 months now . Use it every day and charge it once a month . Has never ran out . Very clear and great volume . No , it 's not as powerful as a stereo speaker , but for the size it is very clear ( I even have fairly severe hearing loss in one ear ) .
2 #### The plastic sheath came undone from either end , although it still works .
5 #### They are Ernie Ball strings , would anyone expect anything other than excellence from EB ?
5 #### Very sturdy spring compressor for the price . Had no issues of threads binding up though I did lube them before use . This is a life saver if you are unable to use external spring compressors . If you do much suspension work , this tool is a nice addition to your tool collection .
5 #### I needed to connect a 50 ft and a 25 ft cat 5 cable in my basement . No notice of loss of speed , latency or noise .
5 #### Great quality product , I truly did not anticipate the thickness and feel this product offers . Worked greatly for our project and gave our printed presentation a professional look and feel .
5 #### You drop the bead , tilt your horn , and pull the swab through . It gets the moisture out , and you do n't have to leave a giant rod in your horn ( which holds in the moisture . This is the stuff I do for a living , take it from me . Choose this over the ' padsavers '
4 #### I changed the transmission fluid in my van with it . After re - adjusting the tightness of the various plastic fittings to stop vacuum leaks , it worked well , if a bit slowly . ( It took 15 minutes to siphon six quarts out of a cold ( 70 * Fahrenheit ) transmission . ) With some basic assembly and approximately thirty pumps of its handle , I placed the unit on the ground to allow gravity to assist its suction . I used my transmission 's dipstick and a Sharpie marker to indicate the length of tubing required to reach the fluid inside . The unit did not collapse on itself and it was a mess - free procedure , but I wish its greenish plastic was more translucent , to allow easier viewing as to how much fluid had been vacuumed into it . I neatly and easily poured the siphoned fluid into a disposal container for recycling . I would recommend this tool to other users who prefer to not jack up their vehicles and lay on the ground to drain their oil .
1 #### The telephone would not recognize the sim card . I would like my money back .
5 #### Keeps your stuff secured . Effortless . I just want to see how the ratchet holds up after multiple uses . Especially after a few rain storms here in Fla. I will periodically shoot it with some lubricant for longevity .
1 #### so far it has not helped my signal strength at all . I still have no signal
5 #### Fit perfect in DHs Siverado and stopped the cargo from sliding around .
4 #### The bag is pretty cheap , it is large enough for my XSI , kit lens . 55 - 250 mm IS , 50 mm 1.8 , and 580ex Flash . I would recommend the bag , although the zip is not very well designed .
5 #### I have an Embroidery Machine that I purchased at the end of 2004 . I did a lot of reading before using it and found out that SanDisk brand flash cards were highly recommended to use when storing purchased designs . They are the ONLY brand of compact flash that does not lose any of my designs ( I had this happen years ago on a different brand of compact flash ) . I have bought almost 3,000 designs over the years and I always trust using a SanDisk Compact Flash card over anything else on the market !
5 #### Yup ! It came very quickly by mail , .. and , it 's an excellent charger with a USB 3 cable ! .
5 #### Man these things make my Tele come alive ! Highly recommended to get that Bakersfield Sound !
4 #### I bought a LS7730 " On - Stage Stands Backline Lighting Stand with Truss " . And these fit good was able to hang my lights how I wanted . I would buy these again and over any c clamp .
5 #### Removed stains that I thought were permanent . There were a few stains that took multiple applications of product , and a large stain or two that did n't come out completely ( they were in carpet for years , so understandable ) , but they were made faint enough to be barely visible . This is a great product , and will constantly be keeping a full can on my shelf . Glad I found it .
5 #### Unless I 'm using the m - steel version these are my go to strings .
5 #### No comparison ... this is the best bluetooth headset on the market . The noise shield is incrediable . I called my husband to test and cranked up the radio and he could only hear me . Almost weird how it works . We bought him one too . Zero road noice . Make sure the devise touches your cheek - which is simple . Con : The ear plug works well , but is very hard and not comfortable after wearing for a short period of time . Problem solved when I bought a package of Jabra Ear Gels at Radio Shack for $ 5.00 . I would give this 10 - stars if possible .
5 #### I have 4 Martin guitars ( one is a backpacker ) but I really slowed down on playing . 10 years ago I played for 3 or 4 hours a night , and now I got to the point where I would pick one up every 6 Months for 20 minutes . I lost my calluses , so these stings are helping me get them back without hurting too much . I will get there again .
5 #### Bought this replacement to learn on how to change my iPhone screen learned step by step and now looks like I can do it myself but I would not change it again took a while kind of hard
5 #### Excellent sound . Volume control and treble / bass knob are easily accessible . Just plug them into the back of your PC . I 've had the same speakers for at least ten years . I used them with the first MYST game , so figure how long ago that was . Every time I get a new PC these speakers get used and the new speakers go into the closet . The Labtec 's are dented and banged up , scratched and dinged , but I wo n't trade them for anything . They 've got the best sound around . I do n't have to crank the volume button to its highest setting just to hear something . They do take up some space on my PC desk , but it 's worth it . The wider apart you place them , the greater the stereo sound .
5 #### It looked nice but never made it to my place . Had to get a refund .
5 #### Very good acquisition to recharge your phone in the Car .
5 #### These strings sound incredible ! I have tried Fender , Gibson , Ghs , Dunlop and Dean Markley BlueSteel . None of them come close to sounding as good as these strings . I used the blue steel for the last five years because I thought they were the best ones that found , until now . I play mostly songs like Matalica , Guns N Roses , etc . I even tried a few songs playing without distortiion and was soooo nice sounding . Sweet Child O ' Mine sounds great with these strings . I definitely recommend these strings .
4 #### The big appeal of this car dash mount is that it works with both iPhone 3GS/3 G and with iPhone 4 . Very few devices can do that . There are two joints . If you adjust both ( do n't force it ) you can mount this on a van windshield . It has stayed in place for days ; the iPhone is a lightweight GPS . It will only adhere to glass or smooth plastic , not vinyl . For any other surface you need to use the adhesive mount , the suction cup will bind to that . It is lightweight , and so is the phone . So they 'll vibrate , you may need to mount so the phone rests on something . The side grips spring out ; the button and apparatus feel fragile . I try to only close them as much as needed . Works well with a standard Apple power connector . Note an iPhone will get hot when used as a GPS in this cradle . The cradle does n't carry heat away , it is an insulator . You will want to let the windshield air conditioner run to keep the phone comfortable .
5 #### I bought mine used three years ago and it works great . It works for a Metallica , Pantera type sound . You can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq . adjusted .
4 #### I am a new guitar owner so my evauatiion is not based on many different types of strings but it worked well for me . I broke the first string while attempting to tune it but it could have been as much my error as the string soooo go for it .
2 #### Case was too bulky . Made the buttons on the phone hard to use . If you are really rough on a phone or drop it alot then this may be the case for you .
5 #### very happy with them , I will be purchase again from this buyer
5 #### For the price it 's perfect ! I keep a few on hand since the price is so good . The Wife has broken 2 sets .. At this price , she can break as many as she likes :) Though I have n't found one yet , it would be nice if the headset could mute calls , but that 'd be asking for waaaay too much :)
5 #### I live in a major metropolitan area , surrounded by cell towers . But my home is at the bottom of the hill , and I 've always had problems with cell phone reception . It 's very common to see me or one of my neighbors outside talking on the phone , trying to find better reception . No more . The installation instructions on this device are pretty demanding . So I wanted to test it out before I installed it , to make sure that it worked . Installation does require a penetration through your house for the coax cable . This was n't quite clear in the instructions or the description . Cell phone coverage at home is now a necessity for me , because I 'm running my business out of my house . In fact , my office is in the basement , where the reception is the worst . So it was either find better reception or rent an office . in my test installation , I just kind of toss the antenna onto the roof . So it was facing more up than towards any cell tower . When the correct cable through an open doorway , plugged everything in , and viola : 3 bars instead of 0 or 1 . Fantastic call clarity . I 've now made a more permanent installation , with the receiver antenna aimed per the instructions . Now I have 4 bars ! I would say this is a fantastic device for improving cell phone reception in urban areas .
5 #### Got it for my daughter 's car .... she displays it with pride .
4 #### Fits much better than the one that came with my Otterbox . Almost seamless . The only thing is they are anti - glare , and after looking at my shiny AMOLED screen it will take getting used to . All around unbelievable deal . No better price on earth . Thanks !
5 #### I have used this product for several years , and have never been disappointed .
5 #### An attractive price , nice picks . They have a very nice feel to them and a very nice color too . I recommend getting a pack to go in your guitar case so you will never be without a pick .
5 #### My son needed a Capo , expensive at music shop where he takes lessons . At Amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price .
5 #### Great case will protect your phone from almost anything that it will come across in a normal day . Great for short drops , Bumps and Scrapes . All of my iPhones have them .
5 #### Had to return because I could n't see past the stock mirror . I used to have these fender mounts when I towed back in the 70 's . Today 's stock mirrors ( at least in my case ) blocked the drivers side view of the mirror . The quality is great and at a good price .
5 #### Everything is clear , even and true . I wear headphones everyday to check mixes . At the end of the day , they 're an industry standard for a reason and I dare you to find a bad review on them .
5 #### bought this so my roommate in college could watch tv with headphones while I slept .
5 #### I 've had this tripod for 7 + years until it finally crapped out on me because of my heavy use . The pan head is extremely fluid for video heads out there . Very light weight , durable . I would avoid bringing this out to the beach which can suppress a lot of the extensions on it . This was the main reason why mines got bad quick . But with normal outdoor / indoor useThis tripod is fantastic for anyone ; amateur and mid - pros alike .
5 #### I looked at radio shack and could n't find an adapter that works . This fits my keyboard perfectly AND it was right on time , packaged well and is constructed well ... and for the price ... more than I expected . Do n't hesitate to use this adapter ...
1 #### All I got on this cam is Yellow Orange Images . It is so grainy that it is hard to distinguish what is being shown . I am very unhappy with this cam and I am returning it today .
5 #### I love this little lite , I clipped it over my computer to shine down on my key board that way I do n't turn on the bedroom light and wake my husband . it is wonderful . It really does light up enough for me to see the keys clearly . It was free , although I have no idea why , but nevertheless its works and I am happy . Also it adjust so very very easy .
5 #### Great resonant skins . These re what John Bonham used as his resonant skins with Emperor batters . So these are great sounding , durable skins
5 #### Cleaned filter with cleaners around the house ... then sprayed with this cleaner and WOW . All the dirt that was missed came out with a simple rinse ! ! ! Never use stuff ' round the house again ! ! ! Great stuff !
5 #### These are very nice I do n't want to use them yet because the color may chip off ... I am trying to use all my other sticks before i break these out .
5 #### it connects my jazz bass that i built to amp correctly and delivers good sound . lifetime warranty .... it 's monster .... i ca n't expect anything more ...... thanks
5 #### This head is not a " touch " head , so if you play jazz or use a lot of brushes , get something else . This is for the hard rockers but still lets the ring come through if that 's how you want to tune it .
5 #### Item arrived as pictured . Installed on a 2000 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor .
5 #### I 'm a professional piano technician and part - time musician . I use this mic ( plugged into a Boss Micro BR recorder ) for recording band rehearsals and gigs . It has a very nice clear , " transparent " sound quality and handles high volume levels with no problem .
5 #### Best bang for buck headphone out there , especially if you can catch them on sale . I picked up a pair for $ 15 ! Not equal to my Sennheiser 598 but not that far off either .
1 #### The packaging was nice , but the part that holds the power cord in is just a cheap plastic clip that does n't stay locked in place . For the money , this purchase was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT ! Do not buy this item and waste your money like I did ! In addition , Amazon has started outsourcing shipping to cheaper companies to save money . I received this package from Prestige shipping . It was delivered by a guy and his daughter in a black unmarked Dodge Caravan at 8:00PM ! I paid for next day shipping and that is what my money bought . Bye Bye Amazon ! ! !
5 #### I like D'Addario 's coated strings . I like the way they sound and more importantly , I like how they do n't rust in a week . Of course your mileage may vary based on how hard and how much you play . If you beat the guitar soundly for hours on end every day , then you 'll want to order a 10 pack of strings and change more often ...
5 #### I bought one of these for my laptop and we liked it so much I bought one for my son 's mac book pro . he says it really works well for it , too . one of his friends noticed it and he bought one ! Good product .
5 #### i am allergic to the rubber stuff on in ear bluetooth , this last longer then any one on the market . I lost it or i would n't need another . Easy to set up and hearing is very clear . this is the best one avail
5 #### I replaced my Holley blue electric fuel pump with this one . I do not have to use an external fuel pressure regulator with this one and it works fine on my 1981 Jeep CJ7 with a high performance 401 CI with a turbo 400 trans
5 #### sometimes you need this kind of cable . works as expected .
5 #### Just like I remembered Hellas from the 80 's . They have that sharp horizontal line on low beam which helps you get them aimed up fairly high .. right up to the bumper level of oncoming cars . They throw a good bit of light off to the right shoulder and wood line ... good for noticing deer before they bolt across the rd . High beams are way out there . Running standard 55w bulbs for now . Like that I can easily increase that to 80w to 100w bulbs if I want to . They sparkle more than sealed beams and have an attractive nearly flat glass face and look good on my Wrangler .
4 #### Love my pad . Makes my car shine like new ! Thanks amazon for your service . Makes my life easier with my product purchases .
5 #### I definitely recommend that you take the time to put the rubber feet on the bottom of this when it arrives . I did n't do that , and I think it scratched my desk a little . Totally my fault . I have bought more of these because they work great . What they are not great for is moving files . If you pick this up and move it around with files in it , if they are n't perfectly centered , they will fall down into the center . It still holds them , but they tip to an angle and stuff like receipts can fall out . I rarely move mine around , so I just make sure everything is centered before I pick it up .
5 #### I know there is a lot of fluff and stuff when it comes to ' which ' cable goes into the 3.5 mm stereo jack on your camcorder or DSLR . Well - this is the one . My ONLY complaint ... the 1 ' ( 12 " ) one includes the 4 " of XLR tip ( meaning the cable itself is not 12 " ) , so buyer beware . Otherwise - they do what you 'd want and expect them to do !
5 #### First used the $ 5 other branded strings and they were awful . Lots of squeaks and mellowing too soon . Then got these 2 - 3 yrs ago and have been only using this brand . They really last a long time . 10 - 12 months I remember not changing to a new set , maybe could last even more but $ 15 a year is nothing . These strings certainly give less squeaks while sliding on my acoustic electric guitar . Now next change will be in Dec2015 .
4 #### The shades were delivered quickly and were well packaged . The kit was complete including alcohol wipes to clean around the door frames before installation which went very smoothly . Good buy .
5 #### would recommend very easy to put on and very easy to have no air bubbles on screen which is great
5 #### Husband loves it ! His office is his truck , so this works perfectly for him !
5 #### Put on my bass guitar gaves the right sound I like will made .Yes I recommand this product to you .
2 #### These sound great when you first get them , but just mild bass over the course of a couple weeks has apparently blown them out a bit . Not entirely , but there is a small but noticeable clicking sound any time that any bass plays . I do not turn them up very loud , so I 'm not sure why this has happened . The other problem is a common one in headphones . If you plan on using them as " portable " headphones ( their explicit purpose ) , be aware that the wire / plug connection will start breaking down over time . You 'll plug them into your smartphone or whatever and carry them around , the plug will get little bits of torque put on it here and there , and over a few months the connection will become intermittent . One or both sides will start failing . The warranty is great , but you do have to pay to ship them to Koss and for return shipping . In my case , they just sent me a brand new pair , which proceeded to blow out after a couple weeks . I swear , I do n't drive them very hard . I 'm not hard of hearing and I do n't like particularly loud music or noise . They just break with normal use .
5 #### Monster MP AV600 Power Protector So much better than cheap units . Our electric service is suspect , no more holes blown from cheap units into the carpeting !
2 #### PROS : Easy to setup . There 's a short cable sticking right out of the back of the dual radios this module is made for . Easy to pair up and pairs really fast . The music is crystal clear . Even clearer than my CD 's or HD radio . CONS : the phone is on the low end of bluetooth . You can hear fine through the speakers but the person on the other end often has problems hearing you . I 've had complaints of muffled , bottom of a well , and windy ( especially with AC blowing full blast . ) Also , when you switch from bluetooth back to radio , it does n't play the station you were on . It 's just silent . You have to choose another station and then go back to the station you want to listen to . It 's kind of annoying . OVERALL : I mostly use it for the music because I got tired of people complaining about the sound quality of the phone . I use a HTC Touch Pro 2 phone btw .
1 #### the sound is really bad , wondering if I had a defective cable , for the price I not even bother to return .
3 #### Seemed to go dead pretty quickly . These sounded good immediately after I restrung the guitar , but by the next gig ( a week later ) they already sounded pretty dull .
3 #### They are okay . i like the sound , but i find the treble strings too slinky after a week of playing . I prefer regular slinky .
2 #### I had great expectations for this , but I am more than disappointed . Like many others have reported here , the unit is FOREVER dropping the connection and the re - connecting . Just a plain pain ! As others have also said , the " instructions " are USELESS .. at best . And , most irritating to me of all is that I 've not been able to figure out if this thing allows you to initiate OUTGOING calls . If it does , can someone please tell me how ? I 've had two other car Bluetooth speaker phones and it has been simple to make a call by pushing one button . Maybe I 've missed something in the " instructions , " but there is nothing even remotly user friendly about this thing . Based on my experience to date I can not recommend this unit and I would likely never purchase another Jabra production in the future .
5 #### I 've had a ton of different headsets , mostly BlueAnt and Jawbone . Both of those are ultimately better , but I 'll take one of these any day of the week for the huge delta in prices . The Motorola runs solid and I 've had several ... my first one years ago lasted a long time and it was a Motorola . Great units ! ! !
1 #### I 'd completely skip the Seagate lineup . Run . Seriously . I had three Seagate drives fail ( the next replaced it 's predecessor ) in about a year 's time . If you 're wondering , I work at a university and we 're encouraged to buy through purchase orders locally . And that meant Seagate . So three drives failed . Yes , that counts as a statistical anomaly . It deserves a fine googling . Some people tried to tell me my computer case did n't have the proper air flow or that my external casing 's power supply hurt the drive . ( NUH UH on each account ) . Other people pointed me out to a firmware problem with a large group of Seagate drives . The drives can enter a limbo BSY state that bricks the drive even though physically there is nothing wrong with it . It can be cured with a very technical low - level serial com with the controller board . ( Which I actually did for kicks . It 's kind of cool . ) Seagate acknowledges the problem . They have a serial number search . Armchair quarterbacks estimate the failure is on 25 % of their lineup . Not sure . Would n't take the chance . They wo n't fix OEM drives . They will do the low level repair thing for retail drives if your serial number comes up in their search page . This kind of mass failure of hard disks happened once before oddly enough . It was with Hitachi / IBM 's DeskStar lineup , properly monikered " DeathStar . " Google it if you 'd like . But anyway , for the time being , Run Away ! Run Away !
5 #### I really recommend Incipio hard shell cases with silicone insert because it really keeps your phone protected . This product is simple to get on and off and looks nice on your phone . I am a person who frequently drops their phone so it is nice to have the corners covered because that is the first place you start to see dings . These cases are nice because you can interchange the colors if you buy more than one , and I have a Verizon iPhone so their accessories are outrageously expensive so it is nice to purchase them at a more reasonable price on Amazon .
1 #### Very low - grade metal . The notched spring tool broke the first time I used it . I was n't expecting snap - on quality , but this might as well have been made out of play - doh .
4 #### I was using this mount with my iPhone 4 with a Switcheasy Trim case ( made from Super tough Scratch Resistant Hydro Polymer material as stated on Switcheasy website ) The mount comes with 2 sets of arms for different size phones . The arms click into one of 3 different mounting grooves in the back to handle different widths & thicknesses . The rubber coated arms holds the phone via grip and tension of the arms . This creates a very solid hold on our cellphone . Unfortunately , the rubber arms may leave scratches on your phone case . The rubbing of the arms against your case as you slide your phone in and out of the mount will cause friction . This may leave marks on your case as it did on mine . The flex neck is short and rigid so it keeps shaking to a minimum . Very easy to set into position . The phone mount is attached with a swivel with preset detentes , so rotating the phone is quick and easy . All plastic construction , but does n't feel cheap . Very solid mount .
4 #### After I wrote my first review , and 10 days after I bought it , I accidentally dropped my Iomega hipzip onto a cement floor from a height of about five feet . It struck right where the purple lid opening contacts with the metal case . It rendered it useless . ( It no longer registered when disks were in it and it emitted all sorts of whirring , clicking noises trying to find them . ) I figured the warranty was as void as I could possibly get for such carelessness but I contacted Iomega anyway . Even after I told them ( twice ) that I had dropped it , they swung into action , faxed me out some forms , told me where to send my unit and oila ... what looks eerily like a BRAND NEW replacement unit arrived on my doorstep just FIVE days later ! ( It certainly was n't the same unit I sent them as it was missing an obvious scratch I had added . ) Now that 's after - sales customer support you ca n't beat anywhere . For this alone I have to give the unit an extra star . Had I dropped any other brand , I 'd be looking mournfully at a pile of expensive junk , with no recourse . NB : The unit was replaced through the south - east Asia / Australasia / Sydney branch of Iomega , but I am assuming that this company philosophy translates elsewhere . As customers , I think we should support companies like this which do the right thing -- and more -- for consumers , instead of always being solely after the almighty buck .
4 #### Installed and doing it 's job . Cost was less than I could get Locally .
5 #### I love the versatility of this hand held radio . I use it mainly in the tethered mode ( no dry cell battery ) and it has delivered a powerful , clear operation .
5 #### These pedals work very well for my Yamaha drum machine .... and they last for years if taken care of ..... :~ )
4 #### For a portable antenna , this will work well with strong signals . To reach out and get more distance signals , you will have to move up to a more dedicated antenna .
5 #### I loved using this clay on our Subaru Forester . Did the whole car with it , crevices , wheels and all , and it still produces a clean face when remolded . That 's using a quarter of a bar ! It is not difficult to mold , works very well , gives good feedback on bumps and does not scratch the paint one bit . I used it in coinjuction with Optimum 's No rinse Wash & Shine as a lube .
5 #### Nice product . Works great & fits in any bag or purse . I have never needed the light or laser but they 're good to have in a pinch . I have purchased multiple chargers & keyboards from New Trent & all of the have met or exceeded my expectations .
5 #### I buy Ernie Balls electric guitar strings for my Jazzmaster guitar , and I 'm very happy with them . What can I say ? Earthwood Rock and Blues are terrific ! ! Great clear sound and warm where they should be . You ca n't go wrong with any Ernie Ball strings ! !
5 #### The best atrings I 've found for my Breedlove American OM / SM . Not too bright , not too mellow . Accentuate everything I love about this guitar . Last a good while too , and for the money they are a great value !
4 #### Does exactly what it needs to . Black high and running light with a dual filament bulb . Housing made out of plastic , I do n't see it lasting more than a couple years . Bulb replaceable .
5 #### Excellent ! This is a beautiful instrument with great capabilities . Perfect for travelling as it comes inside of its own case !
4 #### Worked without any problems outside of the box . I had to invest a bit in having it unlocked from specific carrier in order to use my sim but that was a minor issue along with minor scratches .
3 #### I already owned the Anker 5600mah external battery and wanted another one for my wife . The price , feature set , and reviews were great so I got this . It works fine , but I think that Anker is a better device . Pros Comes with a laser pointer and flashlight Works fine so far and appears to be well made No shiny black plastic Cons The only real negative is the size of the unit . At 400mah less than the other device , it is considerably bigger . It just feels much bigger than it has to be . Also the single button is a bit annoying to use since it controls 3 different functions on the device .
5 #### Boy I thought I would never need these again . Bought an older Baby Lock embroidery machine that saved its files to 3.5 floppies so found myself on Amazon.com looking for them . Needless to say they work perfect !
5 #### Excellent ! Great price and connects the radio to the car great ! !
5 #### This is excellent work like a charm if you have problems with the hdmi cable this will help a lot
5 #### What can you say , it is a CAT5 cable , has quality molded connectors , works , and was cheap . I carry 2 - 3 with me on trips to plug into the connections at my hotel in various lengths , and Belkin always delivers with quality cables .
5 #### Product as expected . Plastic construction , no pin included . Would buy again . Lights up when brakes are applied .
5 #### I ve been a pro drummer weekend warrior 22 years . I have put my har dware in army duffle bags . On stage mic bags and others because I hate hard cases and all the soft case cases ( and hard cases ) were too expensive . I researched all the offerings on amazon reviews and found this . Finally ! Been using this product for about a month and no problems . I 'm always scared of zippers scrapping out . 8 gigs later . No problems . Carrying 4 cymbal stands , 1 mic stand , hi hat stand , music stand , snare stand , throne , 2 speaker pipes for woofer inserts . All good ! LOVE THE WHEELS . My back thanks you amazon reviews . Be advised . If this thing falls apart I will be back to punish ! Lol
5 #### This pedal is fantastic -- I use it to switch between 2 effect chains before my amp ( effectively the same as switching between two guitars into a single amp input ) . Switching is noiseless , even with high gain and distortion boxes emitting molten metal . This box is significantly cheaper than most ABY boxes out there . It 's a little small and the buttons are kinda close together , but it 's not a problem for me and my size 14 shoes . It seems sturdy and well - made . I 'm not thrilled that it requires a screwdriver to change the battery , but hopefully the battery will last for eons as all it does is fund an LED ( the switching circuit is passive ) . I 'm hopeful it will operate fine without a battery , but I have not tried it . NOTE : Read the enclosed short and simple directions . I have seen several online reviews where people complained that the switch did not work for them , and they obviously did not read the directions ( you have to reverse ins / outs depending whether you are switching 2 inputs to a single output , or switching a single input to 2 outputs ) .
5 #### Netgear makes great products and this one is no exception .
4 #### Does its job and boots signal . Gets pretty hot though .
4 #### The only reason i give it 4 stars it 's because i only paid about 8 bucks for it but it 's a toy ...
5 #### Bang for the Buck , a beautiful Guitar at a Great Price , Good construction and nice action , nothing like Epiphone ( Gibson )
5 #### I love Elixer strings - just great sound and they last a long time . Hard to beat these . I do n't hear or feel much difference between the Phosphor Bronze and the other type but I 'm sure there is one - you probably need two guitars of the same make / model strung up with the two types to really figure out which one you prefer .
5 #### I 've actually started using a thumbpick recently but aside from that I exclusively use yellow tortex picks . After all these years of playing it 's probably familiarity at this point but they are hands down the best feeling picks I 've used .
3 #### This review is for the Black Silicone Case / Skin / Cover for RIM BlackBerry Bold 9650 . The item was easy to place onto a Blackberry Bold 9650 phone , but does not work with charger . On each attempt to plug the cell in / charge it , while in this case , the plug would not connect to charge and because a part of the case prevented the cord from fitting properly into the port . Perhaps it can be cut out , but that should not be necessary , it should be made to fit properly . So , very disappointed since it indicated it would fit < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Black - Silicone - Case - Skin - Cover - for - RIM - BlackBerry - Bold-9650 / dp / B003Y3DCGE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Black Silicone Case / Skin / Cover for RIM BlackBerry Bold 9650</a > .
5 #### I am a sax player . I first started using La Voz reeds when I was in high school , at the suggestion of my teacher . I like them better than any other . When I recently picked up a clarinet , I knew exactly what kind of reeds to get . I love La Voz reeds and recommend them to any woodwind player . One note - the product I am reviewing is Medium clarinet reeds . The product pictured is Medium Soft clarinet reeds .
5 #### Good clean optics . Bigger on the mirror than I hoped for . Learn from my mistake and put them on the outer bottom corners .
5 #### I ordered this via Prime and it came within two days just as advertised . A great simple CB for my truck . I wired it to a basic fused cigarette plug and a magnetic antenna from radioshack , once I tuned it with my buddy 's SWR device , it worked great ! Great youtube videos on how to use an SWR thingy , I never used one before , very easy for anyone to do . No doubt this radio will work for years .
3 #### They have a clear bright sound on my Guild D-150ce . I did n't think they stayed bright sounding as long as other D'Addario strings I have used . I now have switched to J16 as I prefer the way they sound , but sound as one knows is a personal thing .
5 #### Excellent product ! ! ! Well worth the price extreme heavy duty and very well made . Only problem , it came in the exact opposite color that I ordered . Although I really did n't care so it did not matter to me ; although this could disturb some people .
5 #### If you 're into washing your own car , you must own one of these ! ! This is great ! I have a SUV and this by it self does the job great ! No need to have multiple towels ! I love this product ! This would be a nice gift and for the price , it 's well worth it !
4 #### item was perfect to my taste . just what i wanted for my cellphone . it is very handy espcially when you are driving .
3 #### I thought I 'd like the feel of these but I do n't like them at all . The surface feels slightly rough and should give a good grip but they just felt awkward . It 's very much a personal taste thing . The seem well made , I just prefer the celluloid picks .
3 #### This does a decent enough job of from getting your phone from being all scratched up and protecting it from short drops . The tabs that snap the case onto the phone wear down or break easily . I do n't expect these to last very long but they are so cheap I buy a few of them in different colors to make sure I always have a back - up
5 #### This is a great pedal ! I truly can not live without the auto on off function . Great sound(much better than a vox IMHO ) .
5 #### Great item . prevents thins from sliding all the way in the back of the truck bed
4 #### My second gator case , and again provides the right amount of protection for light mobile use . I think a good $ 30 investment to protect about $ 400 worth of mics of the SM 57 and SM 58 ( wired ) variety . I can only get the 4 mics and their 4 mic clips to fit in the case , the latter in the zippered pouch in front . Not sure what I will use the internal square cut out for , it could hold another mic . There is no storage area for " cables " if by cables you mean microphone cables . I removed the shoulder strap and intend to set the case inside the cable crate I take to gigs . No doubt it will provide years of dependable service . Please note : this Gator GM-4 Microphone Case is EXACTLY THE SAME BAG AS Musician 's Gear 4 - Space Microphone Bag , but at twice the price . I bought the musicians gear case for $ 15 from amazon , and the only difference is the gator branding . Buy the cheaper one instead !
3 #### Garmin eTrex case is a nice neoprene case providing a little protection for any eTrex handheld GPS , but not a necessary case . It provides some protection for the screen , but at the same time making the screen more difficult to read when the unit is wet . It does not provide its own tether , relying on the tether attached to the eTrex , which must be threaded through a small hole in the case . But I still think it is worth getting just to give your eTrex a little extra protection .
1 #### If I did n't I canot see why so many people like this camera . I have gone thru 8 BATTERIES , in 1.5 days and I have n't even used it that much at all . I figured that the batteries it came with were just cheap so I bought a pack of 8 AA ultra duracels and after about 10 minutes total use , the thing dies on me . And when it was working it kept asking me to format the card . I take 5 pictures and by the way , you have to wait like 10 seconds between shots ( too long ) , so I take the 5 shots and then the light on the camera which tells you the reader is reading the card says it MUST format the card again . Now I lost my pics ! ! I am REALLY disliking this camera totally . I also own a AGFA 780C which I also purchased from AMAZON.COM and this thing works SOOOOO MUCH BETTER , just the picture quality is not nearly as good as the KODAK DC3400 . Amazon.com get ready for incoming junk , it 's being sent back to you . John PS : It just aggravates me so much , I waited over a week and half for this camera to get here and then I get these problems , if there problems . I really needed and wanted this thing for the holidays . I guess it 's the AGFA or a roll of KODAK 800 Max film again .
3 #### Guitar came with damaged strings and it wo n't stay in tune and also a couple of scratches , still not sure if its the strings causing it so i m debating if I should return the guitar .
1 #### I bought this for my mother who ONLY uses the phone for emergency calls . It lasted her 3 uses and I had to buy her a replacement due to cheaper than dollar store quality . I guess yiou get what you pay for :(
5 #### great sounding mic ! ! .i had one of " those sounds as good as a shure mics " no @##$@ # way , shure is the best , and they last
3 #### The Cardo Scala 600 is very lightweight and comfortable . The ear loop bends so that you can form it to your ear for a more secure feel . This Cardo model does not have an ear bud , which I actually prefer . The sound / voice quality has a little bit of an echo . The function and volume buttons are easy to use . The only down side is that it does not have noise cancellation . However , this does not seem to affect the sound quality that much and people can still hear me even though there is a little bit of background noise . Except for the lack of noise cancellation and average sound quality , this is a good inexpensive headset and worth a try .
5 #### I ordered the wrong battery . I ca n't actually test the battery . It arrived quickly . Did n't bother to send it back , it 's inexpensive , not worth the bother . Assume it works fine for the right phone ! I did find and order the correct battery . All is good
4 #### My previous rating did not include the fact that customer service is extremely helpful and pointed out that it takes 3 to 4 weeks before any noticable results . Also the lights are night lights and has nothing to do with the operation . Apparently when plugged in it is working . I will followup with a review in 3 weeks . Not a clue if this is doing anything other than lighting up . If anyone figures out how to test these things pls let me know .
4 #### If you 're looking for the highest quality cable , this is n't it . If you want a good quality cable at a great price , you found it .
5 #### For some reason could n't find high bias cassette tapes around town . Amazon to the rescue . No problems or complaints with this product .
3 #### There is one major caveat to the use of this product that all potential buyers should be aware of . You MUST have at least 1.3 ft or so between the front of your vehicle and where the unit is mounted . It will not be able to register closer than this distance . If you 're purchasing this b / c of a " tight " garage , this could be an issue , as it is for me . This seems a little silly , but I thought the point of this unit was to help you park close to the front wall in a tight garage but not bump the wall . However , the instructions clearly state that the range is 1.3 to 16 feet . " We recommend that you never leave less than 1.3 feet between your bumper and the wall . " This , of course , is kind of ridiculous since if I had 1.3 ft between the front of my car and the front wall , I would n't need a parking assist device . When properly parked , my garage allows approximately 4 " of clearance front and rear in total ( e.g. , 2 " up front , 2 " in rear if centered ) . Thus , I have .25 ft . The unit simply flashes red about 1.5 ft before I get pulled into the proper position and then goes off . This may be fine if you have lots of room in your garage and need to park in a very particular position among the piles of stuff , but if you have a particularly tight garage , it may not serve your needs .
5 #### It works as described . I was kind of bummed though after I ordered it to find out that I could do the same exact thing with my earring . I did n't really have to spend money on this . So if you have an earring at home , save your money .
5 #### My wife got me this as a Christmas gift , and put a picture behind the back so I always have a picture of my family on the back of my phone in addition to the digital one on the front of my phone !
5 #### The nook tablet is great . I have used it to check e - mail , browse and look at books , and also transferred one from my p.c . I like the way it will sync with the direction its rotated , and I love the touch screen . Thanks Amazon !
5 #### I used the original Mophie Juice pack for about 6 months with my 3 G until I wore it out by cycling it twice a day & it no longer took a charge . Worked pretty well but it looked kind of funny ( a little big & the iPhone sticks out of the top ) . I 've had the Juice Pack Air with my 3 G & now the 3Gs for about 2 weeks and it 's been great . It has a little less power but a much better form factor . It just feels like a larger iPhone . While the original Juice Pack has a mat finish , the Juice Pack Air has a very smooth finish which makes it a bit slippery . It slipped out of my pocket once already & I almost lost my iPhone . So the improvements I would suggest : ( 1 ) more POWER and ( 2 ) mat / non - slippery finish .
2 #### I am a huge fan of elago iphone cases . I have 8 different elagos from my iphone 3GS . So naturally I thought this one would be amazing . While it looks great and fits fine , the whole " breathe " aspect is achieved by holes in the case . Wholes that end up allowing dirt , dust , and other particles in the case . They then scratch the back of the phone , which is glass , while it is being moved around on a table , or in your pocket , or wherever . I got a case for my new iPhone 4 in order to prevent this . Now , even though I had a case on it ( I stopped using this one ) , I have a scratched up iphone back .
5 #### Nothing to get excited here but its OEM and it works as it should . Cheap routine maintenance for a good running vehicle .
4 #### The grip is excellent . But I prefer the 1.14 Sharps over these . These are sturdy and look like I wo n't be needing another set for quite some time
5 #### works fine , build quality is just as good as factory . I found out that these type of horns have to be rubber mounted , they have to be able to vibrate in order to produce sound . Rigid mounting will prevent any significant volume .
5 #### I purchased this phone as an upgrade from a phone with just a keyboard . I needed a phone that had more organizational features but still allowed texting . This phone delivered above and beyond my needs . There are so many features with this phone . It has a very responsive touch screen and is very very user friendly . The stylus is a great feature with a touch screen This is my first Palm device and I am getting around in it very easily . It also is very compact , a lot smaller than it looks in pictures . If you are looking for a versatile phone that helps you keep your schedule organized with spending a great deal of $ $ $ this is the phone . The keyboard is small , but so is the phone . I do n't have any problems with texting or entering information . Why spend more for the same or less ? Definitely a great buy you wo n't regret getting this one .
5 #### This stuff is Amazing . The 1st time I used it I put it in my girlfriends 2002 Ford Escape that the transmission was slipping in . Within 5 miles it stopped slipping and have n't had a problem since . The 2nd time was recently in my 1994 Ford Bronco that started slipping bad . After putting it down the dipstick I had to drive it for about a week and it stopped about 90 % of the problem . Saved me money I did n't have to repair it . But our auto part store stopped carrying it so now with shipping the price has doubled
5 #### I absolutely love this case for my evo . I received it fast , and the quality is great . It fits snug on my phone and looks great ! ! ! I would definitely recommend buying from this company .
5 #### It works great I just wish it had one cable for the signal and power so it only takes one USB port , but great for the price .
3 #### This is a pretty cool pedal for the price . I 'm not all that big on vibrato , but I did the cost free and easy mods and its far more useable .
5 #### I have two 580ex i use in combination with it and it all work like having my portable studio lighting system .
5 #### i have bought 3 of these and all have been nothing short of amazing ! I build cooler radios and use these to charge the battery . This is a live saver .
5 #### Bought these to expand our intranet . Easy to set password . They work very well .
5 #### Excellent remote . I wanted one of these for my camera and saw that Amazon had this one . Works well and easy to use .
4 #### It 's a factory part so it fits . Not a lot else to say about it .
5 #### This case is very good and at a great price . You no long can find good quality cases for gen 2 or 3 ipods . This one clips on very well and is impact resistant .
5 #### These strings are the BEST . Great sound , long lasting ... look for them on sale and buy several sets
5 #### It 's price has dropped to $ 49.99 for those who do n't have a contract . I wonder what the price is when you already have a contract . This looks like a really cool phone and probably way better than my enV2 .
5 #### I 've been using the P - Touch PT-80 for over a year and just ran out of tape . The product works great for labeling files , wires , or anything else . I noticed some reviewers said the tape was hard to peel . The PT-80 has a tape peeler feature ( just a little slot ) that gets the peel started and works like a champ .
5 #### This is a great large trackball that was discontinued after a few years by Logitech . It is however , very much a vintage collectible -- still functional as a trackball -- but not current cutting - edge technology . THE REVIEWS START IN 1999 , PEOPLE . * There 's no way Logitech will provide a Windows 7 driver for this . Still many users believe this is one of the best trackballs ever made , comparable perhaps to the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Microsoft - Trackball - Explorer / dp / B00005853Z / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Microsoft Trackball Explorer</a>&nbsp;-- also no longer made . A new MSTE one will set you back hundreds ; they 're scarce . * Amazon says they first stocked this in 1973 ? What is that , 22 years before Amazon launched ? Was n't the web called ARPANET then ?
5 #### Works great for streaming ! have not had any stutter or lag issues since I upgraded to this
5 #### these are great headphones . I have had $ 20 sony ones for years and these are much better for 1/4 the price
5 #### Great for walking with Run keeper or Zombies Run app , also simply a good way to keep the phone nearby when chatting with friends or listening to a book on tape while cleaning house , cooking , or gardening . Love it ! Have dropped the phone a couple times while in this rather than my old otter box , and so far no disasters have occurred .
5 #### This pick holder works for me . It holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed . It fits my Jasmine well . Buy it from GO - DPS since they have one of the best customer service and quality products !
4 #### These lock the guitar strap securly but stand a little high off the guitar body . They are solid and detach easily when you want to remove the strap .
4 #### Loved it . Great read , great story , well written . A question of who betrayed the family was n't answered in the book but it does n't take away from the story in any way and it 's answered in another book . Well enjoyed .
5 #### The 5.3 LM7 truck engine is very restrictive from the factory , THIS kit is perfect to unlock some hidden horse 's I personally believe i gained more HP than the kit says it will give due to my custom exhaust , BUT that s not all it gives i GAINED almost 5MPG City i mean come on how can u beat that it will pay for its self in less than a year , i have estimated about 18 city and almost 26 highway ( IF ) i keep my happy hot foot out of it , ( harder than u think when u can hear ENGINE roar from the front and the rear ) especially when if u are like me LOVE performance street machines yet want to keep the driveablity .
5 #### It is very easy to plug into your WII and into your TV . It works well , and the quality is good . It is definately worth getting .
5 #### It 's a muffler , makes the shop vac quiet , stays in place , does n't stick out too far . one two three four .
4 #### Assembled the mount today . Have n't ridden my bike yet , but it seems very snug and sturdy . At first I was so upset because the Mounting Cover did NOT fit over my Garmin eTrex Legend HCx due to the bulge of the Micro SD card slot . Was getting ready to return it . There was nothing in the bracket instructions to use the mounting clip that originally came with the GPS . Luckily I suddenly remembered one reviewer 's advice about the clip before I purchased this mount , as I had to return a previous bike mount ! ! ! I am so grateful for that helpful review so I 'm " paying it forward " . It 's a good thing I saved the clip and still had it , as I bought the GPS several years ago . So all I really needed was the bracket that goes around the handlebar ! The cover is useless for my model ! If your model comes with an SD card slot , make sure you have that mounting clip ; if it does n't have the slot , then this cover should be fine .
2 #### I bought this one along with the other green one . It 's cheap made with a cheap color . Just do n't waste your money .
5 #### I have 4 of these . I use to protect and transport the Peavy PV10 mixer . Seems solid enough quality . I 've have a couple of them for 2 years and still holding up great .
5 #### The Ultimate GS100 Guitar Stand is well - made , well padded and works just as it should . I also have a GS200 stand which also is very impressive . I had tried an On Stage GS7465 Guitar Stand which was very disappointing , lacking in quality and protective padding . I immediately returned the On Stage and went with another Ultimate Stand . I was not disappointed . Both the GS100 & GS200 are made with the excellent attention to detail and work perfectly , protecting your guitarsfrom scratches and drops . I 'm sold on the Ultimate stands - They fold nicely for carrying yet do n't take up much space at all when opened . In fact I keep mine opened and ready to hold a guitar in my music room . These are nice stands that I highly recommend . I would not trust my guitars to a lesser stand .
2 #### I dropped my phone MANY times before the original screen finally cracked , then I bought this one from this seller but cracked within a week ! ! ! I wanted to make an OTHER purchase before I was told in a retail store that I could upgrade to IPhone 4 for less than $ 50 , so I wen ahead and forgot about ordering a new screen .
5 #### These are the best cord sleeves I found .. I had to return several different ones because they were not large enough to accommodate my flat panel tv cord .. These I was able to fit the 3 prong tv cord , 2 hdmi cords and a coax cable .. It was perfect and I had enough to use left over pieces for another cord for my fireplace ... I was able to easily paint them to match the wall color and when I had to remove a cord they opened easy enough to take the cord out and close them again without breaking or bending . Would get them again anytime .
1 #### I bought this radio to listen to AM when I ride my bike . The station I like to listen to is less than 40 miles away . I get constant static and have to play it as loud as possible to hear the voices . I have to keep it turned just right or the station fades . It may be all right if you live in a city with a radio station you want to listen to but it is worthless out in the country . I remember when Panasonic was made in Japan .
5 #### I use this camera at work to produce newsletters and stuff . Previously I used film and scanned the photos ; this makes an incredible difference to my productivity . And the results I get are much better than before . No matter what I ask of this camera , it does the business , makes me feel like more of a pro than I am . I love the ability to twist the lens and look down on the screen ; all cameras should be like this . You 'll need to spend quite a bit of time getting used to the many different screens if you want to use anything other than auto . It 's all a bit complicated , but you eventually get used to it . I would have preferred a wider wide - angle too , and the on - camera flash is nothing special . And it EATS batteries ! Also , my example occasionally refuses to switch ; the only way is to open the battery cover . It 's not exactly small either ... BUT the pictures it takes can hardly be faulted - even blown up to A3 size !
4 #### Have n't used this yet , but i 'm still using up what I have left . The product is easy to use , I have an old filter that I put in for a few days to allow the spray on oil to dry before use .
5 #### This worked great . Just foloow the directions and you ca nt go wrong . I had so much left I did my friends filter too . Save yourself some money and get this before buying a new filter .
5 #### These really work . Love the scent , not overpowering or perfume like at all . Cleaned 2 phones , 2 pc 's and tv screen with just one wipe .
3 #### I wanted to listen to music on my HTC Diamond [ Sprint ] while exercising and around the house , without wires . This unit has good sound , and nice controls - I can activate voice command for hands free dialing , and I can change music tracks without pulling out the phone ; Nice . Unfortunately , the thing is really uncomfortable after a while , especially while wearing my glasses . Note , however , that I have a large head , and the unit is not adjustable [ like that would have been difficult to design in ] . Additionally , and I knew this before purchasing by reading other reviews , you can not carry your phone in your front pocket while using these outside . I put the phone in my rear pocket if walking , but I 'll have to wear a fanny pack or some other trick to get the transmitter within line - of - sight of the back of the headset . This is another pain - in - the - rear [ no pun intended ! ] . I will say it 's really cool to be out for a run when the phone rings and the auto - answer is turned on ; the unit picks up and I can talk without having to slow down . I can dial out , as well , with the voice command . The bluetooth technology is limited , but I think the designers could have made this more friendly . This unit may just be the best available , for now , but it seems likes it should still be in " beta " to me .
5 #### Made my spare tire happy and me glad so no one can steal it .. Great Price and Fast Shipping ..
5 #### Drum sticks for an electronic drum set . Not sure I can tell a difference with regular sticks , but these are good .
4 #### The price is right ... at under $ 1 ! ! Must note that when scratching does occur the under plastic color that shows through is white .
5 #### I agree with other reviewers that Yamaha really needs to make their products compatible with others . However , this cord does exactly what it 's supposed to with no hassle . I use it with my Yamaha ypt-310 ( a pretty basic keyboard ) and Cubase . It works fine but the latency is definitely there . This is probably my computer more than anything . Would recommend to anybody with a Yamaha product . I mean there 's really nothing else out there , right ? ;)
5 #### Good deal and got me back in business with labeling .
5 #### These speakers are absolutely wonderful , they sound better than our living room surround sound setup ! Do n't let the size intimidate you , the speakers themselves are very small , and very professional looking , I specifically use them in my home office . The sound is superb from Mp3s , DVDs , CDs , to anything else that would make a sound out of your computer speakers . I keep the subwoofer on the floor , works well there . The volume and bass controls are well - placed on one of the flat panel speakers . The cords are a good enough length to position the speakers and subwoofer anywhere around a large desk . I must say that I recommend these speakers to anyone that asks for a quality 3 piece set such as this one . The quality surpasses any other sets that I 've listened to , especially in this price range .
3 #### the cover was shipped fast that s good , y looks better than expected but it does not fit my blackberry perfectly , the left side looks kinda popped out .
4 #### Great piece of equipment . Works well . Cost much less than local music stores .
5 #### Perfect fit for 4 needles and headshells .. just as pictured . I need my needles protected for plane trips and this case is SOLID . Not sure if its waterproof but it feels like it is .
5 #### I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes . I used d'addarios for many years . I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable . they sound great too . The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating .
5 #### I put this micro sd card in my new phone and it works great and fast shipping and attractive price .
5 #### Holds my headset perfectly and protects it nicely . Magnetic snap closes securely and fits nicely in my purses . Highly recommend for those buying the Voyager Pro .
4 #### works great and charges ipads , tablets , smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets . I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger .
5 #### I 've been operating heavy equipment and cranes for over 30 years , now own an excavation company . Made the mistake of going the ' cheap ' route and buying some home depot crap grease guns for my equipment . Nothing but frustrations and they would only last a season . I got my original Lincoln grease gun in 1987 and it still works as well as the first day I used it . I 'd expect the same from these .
4 #### These guides were different from what I expected , but I might have been mistaken . I found these guides too low ( they sit too close to the wood when installed , I had some fender basses for comparison , and the guides on them were " taller " , the strings had less angle and pressure over the nut ) . The finish is not good too ; albeit being a fender product , these guides look like made in a hurry , with tooling marks , no polish whatsoever . Again , in comparison to the ones in the fender basses I had for comparison , these look too " vintage " .
5 #### Best value in wall mount and is of excellent quality . Have purchased many of these now , andd will only purchase these in furture .
4 #### One of my mainstay harps . They ai n't so pretty to look at ( subjective I know ) but they last well , play clean , and have replaceable parts . Ca n't ask much more for the price .
5 #### I love these tuners . When I tried these on a kit guitar I use to test various pickups and electronic experiments and practice luthier skills like replacing frets ( why tear - up my good guitars ) , I was hooked . Now , all my guitars have these tuners ... fabulous !
5 #### I 've had this iPhone holder for about a month now and I love it . My iPhone is in a black rubber case and the Kensington Car Mount holds it easily . There 's a button on the back you press and the arms spring open . Because of the low price I did n't think this would hold but the suction cup has held firm and the arms fit snuggly around the iPhone . I could n't be happier with my purchase .
4 #### Hey , a simple tool that does what it is supposed to do better than anything I 've used before ... an appropriately priced ! What more could you ask for ?
2 #### This is a rock solid shock mount . The mike screws on tightly , and is held very securely . The materials & construction of this mount are top grade , and it has a heavy , quality feel to it . The pop filter is in exactly the right place and is mounted on a very sturdy arm which is fully adjustable .
5 #### I bought this holster for my evo 4 g which is in an otter box case . This product fits it perfectly allowing me to carry my phone on my belt instead of in my shirt pocket . If you 've got an evo 4 g in an otter box and are looking for a holster this is the one to get . You ca n't beat the amazon price on this item either .
2 #### Yes , it fits . Although it is n't as pretty as the pictured cover . I am disappointed , I expected more . If it does n't frustrate you that you are unable to easily access the buttons on your phone ( mute function , volume controls , power button , etc . ) , and you do n't care about high quality merchandise with a fat wallet to buy another phone when it breaks while using this product , be my guest . Buy with pleasure . As for me , I will be buying an Otterbox . I 've used 3 , each have survived me dropped it on the kitchen floor , my toddler dropping it in her cereal bowl , and the dog attempting to use it as a chew toy and my phone remained in near mint condition .
3 #### We live in a valley in the Blue Ridge and the nearest cell tower is behind a mountain to where we only get cell coverage in one corner of the house , and then only 1 or 2 bars . Based on the good reviews , decided to give this a try . Installed it on a temporary pole ( we 're in a short term rental ) and pointed it towards the tower . The signal strength improved , sometimes 3 or 4 bars , but we still need to be near that same corner of the house . We still ca n't roam around the house and talk . Perhaps it would work better if it was mounted on the roof as recommended , but that really was n't an option in our case .
4 #### Looks cheap but works . Lasted a long time . Easy to install . Installation was easy and looks stylish . I would purchase again .
5 #### This was the thing my 8 - year - old wanted for his birthday and it is awesome . It came right on time , beautiful guitar and sounds great .
1 #### I had this bluetooth for about three weeks . And it does not work anymore I had the motorola headset which was great . Just wanted something new and up to date I will be taking this back two radio shack tomorrow . To get another plantronics another try . But if you buy make sure you keep your reciept .
5 #### Keeps stuff from rolling around the back of my jeep . From water botels , tools , extra clothes , a blanket , or groceries , keeps them put . If I 'm going to be bouncing around , I put caribeaners on to keep things from bouncing out of the net . For onroad adventures , gravity does the job .
1 #### the mirror looks good but when you turn the phone on it has a rainbow color hard to see the screen i would not get again
1 #### [ EDIT ] After using this for several months I 'm lowering my rating considerably . If you only have to use it once , it 's a good tool for a good price . But as others have said , the plunger does not seal . All the grease slips past the plunger ( inside the gun ) . When this happens , the gun stops working entirely . Cleaning it out is a nightmare . It 's a messy , messy nightmare . If it broke today , I would NOT buy another one of the same . All the cons I listed below are still there , but the added problem of the leaky plunger makes me lower my rating to one star . [ /EDIT ] It 's inexpensive and it works good enough . With every pull of the trigger some grease comes out , but then it keeps coming out until pressure equalizes . It 's an air pressure thing - if you have any air in the system ( and I do n't know how to get all the air out ) , it 'll keep leaking grease until the pressure equalizes . It 's inexpensive and works ok . If it broke today , I 'd buy another one of the same .
5 #### I 'm a blues guitarist . I 've used these Jim Dunlop Nylon picks for 28 years . I use this thickness for electric and sometimes acoustic . I also buy the next thickness up for acoustic as well . Great price and worth wait . Amazon is using USPS to deliver a lot of items like this . I stopped paying for Prime as I can afford it . $ 35 or more and you get free shipping . This item was part of a $ 35 plus purchase .
5 #### We got this phone for our 12 year old middle schooler and she absolutely loves it . She fell in love with it at first sight , loves the white and green color combo . She says texting is so quick now with the keyboard and she loves all the applications and extras . In fact I 'm a bit jealous of all it 's features compared to my Balckberry Pearl . For your money it 's packed and good buy compared to more spendy phones like the iphone and the Pantech Duo she was also looking at . My only complaint is the lack of accesories such as cases right now ..... but it 's new and I 'm sure we will start seeing them .
3 #### Do n't forget how you pushed the button , off or on tee hee .
5 #### I used to use mink oil until I found out the dirty little secret that mink oil is just a good marketing lie for PIG FAT . Yes that is correct .... pig fat . I researched the best conditioners and Lexol was rated # 1 . I agree . Excellent product .
3 #### It does everything it 's suppose to do except in the wind . Outside , it is about useless .
5 #### I run a backpack program through my work where we give away backpacks to organizations who work with families . We bundle the backpacks by the handles in bundles of five and use zip ties to do it . I 'd bought a few hundred of these at a hardware store for beaucoup dollars last year and decided to try to hunt them down online . Lo and behold , Amazon has a bag of 1,000 . I ordered them and they came in great condition . For zip ties that supposedly have 75 pound capacity , these are very small for their capacity . They 're extremely well built and we 've never had one fail in the few hundred that we 've used and abused since last year .
4 #### One thing is it wo n't accept picture messages on ATT in the US , but can find solutions online . It is an overall good product . It does what its supposed to and does it well . No complaints , it showed up on time , is good quality , and packaging was sufficient .
3 #### UPDATE : After a couple months , it started to squeak , but not quite as badly as the other throne . Minus two stars . Original Review : ---------------------- Made the mistake of getting a $ 30 Spectrum throne first . Nope . It was a squeaky , uncomfortable piece of trash . This PD 700 throne is the real deal though . If it does n't have enough padding or sturdiness for you , it 's time to go on a diet instead of blaming a throne . I have no doubt that this could accommodate the biggest of butts while they rock out on drums . It does n't squeak . It 's comfortable . Get it .
5 #### Perfect just have tool for your guitar case . Very easy to use .
3 #### It 's versatile ... but the string winder squeaks something awful and the cutter hinge is so tight that it grooves out the metal where the two sides rub together . It saves space and it 's not awful for the price ... but I think most people would be better off getting a good cutter and a good string winder as separate items .
4 #### i ve used this product about twice and do n't really have any major complaints . my pictures came out great . i used it at a drag strip and needed it for taking pictures of the cars flying by at nighttime and i was able to capture them nicely due to no camera shake ( using a tripod of course as well ) . the only thing i do n't particularly like is that it goes into the lock position quite easily taking extra pictures that are n't needed , and also the small hole for the wire to be inserted in for packing does nt really hold it that well and the wire just kinda unravels , but i would recommend it to anyone who has a need for it .
3 #### After about a month and a half I have noticed some corrision on the A and D strings at the 4th fret . That is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than " regular " strings . I like the way they sound . They are a little harder to play than the D ' Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar , and the Martins that I have used in the past . If I still have to change them every 2 or 3 months they are not really worth the extra cost .
5 #### This little guy has saved my bacon on more than a few occasions . It 's small enough to fit in your pocket , yet packs a whopping 5000 mAH battery to rescue your power hungry smartphone or any other usb powered device ! Ideal for anyone who travels and needs extra juice to get them thru a long flight , or drive . The construction is solid , and the button is NOT hard to push , as some reviewers have said . I would buy this again without hesitation . Hope this helps .
5 #### Best picks I 've ever used ! ! I will never use anything else . Great for playing metal guitar , makes pinch harmonics super easy !
4 #### Very nice , really like the size , and easy to hook up .
5 #### Although I have n't actually purchased any of these picks from Amazon , I have been using the Jim Dunlop Nylon picks for years . I prefer .38 mm for simply strumming an acoustic , though I lean towards the . 60 mm for almost everything else , but if I want a sharp , bright sound I go with .88 mm . rather than a full mm . because I still like to have that flex . Frankly , I do n't know why one would use any other guitar picks than these .
4 #### Works great but loud as hell . Wish I would have spent a little more and got the Upper scale Holley that is less noisy . Bought the Billet Holley Prefilter and after pump Billet Holley filter as these are expensive but reusable . Bought cutoff electrical switch that will cut off pump in case of . Accident . Installed Holley fuel regulated also
1 #### No help at all . I live in a mobile home with weak signal , tried everything I could think of , no help , worthless .
5 #### Needed two of these for my eight string . Love these .
5 #### Need this kit with your K&N filter , so there is n't to rate about it . Buying was on amazon was cheaper than buying it at a automotive store
5 #### When my dad decided he wanted a smartphone , we were really concerned about protecting it because he works in a hot factory where he welds and runs machinery all day and has mangled and melted parts of a few cheap flip phones . He also sent one through the lawnmower blades when it fell out of his pocket . So after ordering his first smartphone , mom and i decided to get this for him as well as a heavy duty case and a screen protector . He has the samsung exhilirate phone with a bulky ballistic case and a regular screen protector ... so far his phone has been well protected for 8 months in this along with the case and screen protector . Alas , the clip on the back of this belt holster finally ripped away from the fabric and he has it super glued on for now ( which is working ) . He wants a new one though , so I 'm getting him a second one . He 's really really rough on everything when he 's working so this should hold up for a while under rough conditions and for much longer under normal circumstances . It 's also roomy and fits his bulky case .
1 #### I did everything that the instructions stated for prep . I wire brushed and used steel wool to get as much rust off as possible and clearly see where the rust was , then I cleaned the area with cleaning solvent and let it dry . Finally I brushed possibly 4 coats ( every few minutes)using the cross etching technique to the various parts of the pinch welds under the car and the wheel wells . This was done during the Wisconsin summer months and all seemed good so far . It was n't until the fall with the rain and cold temperatures that I started to see the rust come through and begin staining . Now that it is winter the rust stains have only gotten worse . Beting that it is well below the stated temperatures to use Rust Bullet I will can not apply another coat . Surprisingly on the pinch welds where I DID NOT use Rust Bullet but had black Duplicolor Undercoating aerosol there has not been any sign of rust coming through the paint ( I used the same prep methods ) . For this I will not buy another Rust Bullet product and will try POR-15 in black .
1 #### For $ 5.00 I was n't expecting much and that is just what I got These headphones are : 1 . Sound quality is poor ; the volume is very low 2 . Not compatible with my HTC One S ( Android ) 3 . Very , very cheaply made 4 . Not comfortable at all Cheap is dear . Spend your money on quality items and do n't waste your time with these .
2 #### The overall product quality is good . Just 2 negatives , it is loose fit for nexus one . The magnetic clasp messes up the internal compass on nexus one .
2 #### The ear pads on my old , $ 10 Sony headphones rotted away and these Panasonic headphones were less expensive than buying replacement pads for the Sony headphones . But I found these Panasonics to be very tinny , and the right angle jack was too large to work with my iPhone when in its case . Two stars since even these headphones are more comfortable than sticking something in your ear . But in terms of sound , they 're pretty lousy , in my opinion .
5 #### This is a disposible camera so obviously the photos are not of the same caliber as those taken with a true underwater camera . Photos were OK - a little dark and mostly greenish and unless something was up fairly close , did n't look like much . But the camera worked without incident so I give it 5 stars for that reason alone .
5 #### they work and are cheap so why not . I ended up giving half of them away but i would order more
5 #### Very worth the mess avoidance . Simple and easy to use . I will not miss not having to jack up my vehicles to get at the oil plug .
5 #### This little amp sounds much bigger with nice tones and dynamics . I 've tried some of the other little practice amps that sound like transitor radios . The Pignose is a real guitar amp . I highly recommend this for a small carry - along amp for small rehearsals or vacation .
5 #### If you need a new SIM card for an old AT&T wireless phone , you can not beat the value at this site . No shipping charges either . Saved me $ 23 vs buying at the store , but had to wait for a few days for it to arrive ! So if you are not married to the cell phone , you have a deal at this site !
4 #### This is the only mic that is practical for use with my ( apparently discontinued ) Panasonic stereo cassette recorder ( the onboard mic is monaural ) . Ignore the cord and simply attach the mic directly to the machine for a package that is scarcely any larger , heavier or less convenient than the original machine . Surprisingly , Panasonic offers no mic for the recorder , even though it 's seen at least two editions . With the cassette machine I notice no improvement in sound quality with the higher - priced , stick - shaped Sony stereo mic . Having had a couple of misfires with a digital mini - recorder ( admittedly not " mechanical " breakdowns ) , I 'd still recommend a cassette machine , if only for a back - up .
5 #### Ernie Ball strings ! What else can I say ? They 're great !
5 #### Cover is easy to put on once you warm it up as instructed . If the item is cold , installing is impossible . The stock steering wheel is plastic and very slick , this cover helps the grip .
5 #### Was comfortably able to tune to drop b on a 25.5 " scale .
5 #### They are great ! Absolutely nothing wrong with them ! Can always use extra ones ! Thank you so much ! ! ! Always keep protected ! !
4 #### This is the 440MLa . An excellent sound , with plenty of clean , high frequency detail . I do n't find it too bright , but there is lots of variation , depending on the record . Good records really show up nicely . Much less tracking distortion that I 'm used to and not the warm sound of the Grados , which I do n't miss . My only gripe is the low tracking force ... 1.4 g means it is easy for clumsy people , like me , to bump the stylus out of the groove .
3 #### So I purchased the phone , and all was well for 5 months . One day I was using it , and the screen went completely back . I could n't even get past the apple icon on the home screen . I tried to reset it , and everything , and did the system restore ... nothing worked . I finally brought it to the apple store . Apple looked at it and said they circuit board fried itself , and would cost just as much as a new Iphone 4S to fix it . So I let them recycle it , and I went out and purchased a Samsung Galaxy III
5 #### I bought a cheap camera from Agfa , sent it back . I read a lot of reviews and decided on the Olympus D-360L. It takes great pictures for Web publishing . I have n't even used the maximum resolution setting on it yet , as only two photos will fit on the 8 MB card , and I compress the photos for the Web anyway . I do n't print pictures from it , since 35 mm is so much cheaper , but I 'd think 5x7 photos would look great with a good dye sublimation printer . I bought an inexpensive SmartMedia USB reader from Sandisk ( $ 30 ) , so transferring pictures is quick , painless , and does n't eat batteries . As far as I know , the USB reader will work on a Mac , but I do n't own a Mac . The only thing I wish is that I would have bought the D-460Z instead , as I really miss a zoom feature . The digital zoom on the 360 is not worth using .
5 #### I have gotten myself into DIY car jobs within the last few years and everybody who has been doing it longer than I have has always recommended Seafoam to me . My gas mileage increased more than five mpg the first time I poured a can into my car and I have been a firm believer ever since . It 's also good for cleaning catalytic converters . I recommend looking up this procedure on the internet before attempting but if done correctly , you may not need to pay for that brand new catalytic converter that your local repair shop is saying you need .
5 #### I 'm an experienced bass player with nice vintage basses . I needed a decent guitar for songwriting and recording purposes in my home studio . I 've always had a low opinion of Squier instruments and never considered buying one until now . I have no other Telecaster experience to compare this to , but it 's a well - built guitar . No blemishes that I can find , and it arrived with a good setup . I 'll probably replace the pickups but it suits me just fine for now . It 's become one of my favorite guitars next to my Ibanez Iceman .
5 #### This is simple in design and construction and works well with a good , solid stainless u - bolt and big 3/4 " nuts . It 's nice to look out the back window and not see the bike flap around . A little expensive for what it is . But I think it will last a while .
2 #### Its funny that , as I write this , there are 2 5 - star reviews and 1 1 - star . I do n't think its as good as the 5 - star reviews let on nor as bad as the 1 - star . Yes , it is loud -- louder than the Firth and other pads that are wood or composite bases with a rubber pad on them -- those have little or no sound , unless they have BBs or other objects designed to mimic a snare sound like the Pro - mark X - pad . On the other hand , this pad is about the same or a little quieter than the Firth stock pad and slimpad -- ones designed to mimic the feel of a marching snare . I own several pads , including this one . This Remo pad is the one I do n't use . This would be a better pad if it were still built as it was in the ' 70s -- more or less the top of a snare drum with padding under the head . The older ones had metal rather than plastic rims and was tunable with drum keys rather than a screwdriver . If you can find a cheap one used , get it . Its size and light weight are a big plus . Throw it in a backpack with some sticks and you can practice on the road . But make sure you are all by yourself or in another part of the house .
5 #### I received the wrong size color caps ( my fault ) . Customer Support was very helpful in getting me the right size for my lighting system . I will recommend this company to my musical friends and will use them again .
5 #### They work as well as any Dunlop pick ; they do n't crack , which is a big plus if you use the general Fender variety . I go a little thicker than I would for regular plastic picks , because they get flimsy after a while . Take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost - it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store .
4 #### Its a nice adapter . I use it to plug my samsung behold into my car stereo . Only annoying thing is i have to unplug it to answer calls and when i receive calls music stops but i ca nt hear my ring tone . Overall it gets the job done and its not expensive .
4 #### These are great . Easy to open and install . They operate very well , my guitar has not fallen . clever design and all you need is a phillips head screwdriver . I gave a four star because they are awfully bulky . They are quite large and will take some getting used to .
4 #### These headphones sounded very good with linear sound and excellent detail . Unfortunately , the left cannel would intermittently drop out . I would have to wiggle the plug at the earpiece to get it to work .
4 #### They really do last longer . 4 months later it still has that " Bronze " tone . All others that I have used last only a few months before that bronze tone is gone and they sound like reg strings . .
4 #### The cord fit and has worked well since pur hase . Appears to be good quality on the metal ends . No negative issues to add .
3 #### These did not fit a 2012 jeep Wrangler , the opening too narrow to fit the arm width . So I just removed the blade and installed it into the bracket I already had , so I used it as a " refill " . Other than that , I 'll have to see how long they last . After 9 months , they are streaking and need to be replaced . Not the silblades I remembered lasting years
5 #### same as purchased 1 week before at verizon for 24.95 for a fraction of the price . Excellent value hard to believe .
5 #### awesome they still have these around . works great , shipped really fast .
5 #### Excellent quality as expected . Tonal quality is equal to the heavier strings that this new guitar was shipped with
1 #### garbage but the only thing they got for it , I 'm at their mercy ... got ta spend $ 8 every year or so and a half a day putting them in ... made in taiwan crap
5 #### Love the sound of these strings . Sounds perfect on my acoustic electric guitar . I m really pleased
5 #### Its sturdy , holds my tv really good , its adjustable & really really easy to install . An excellent product . I would definitely recommend it . ] I bought this mount on Feb , 2014 . Today is 20 Nov , 2016 ! ! ! I never thought I would write something for a TV MOUNT again , after 2 & half years ! ! ! Well , here I am ! Amazed AGAIN ! I was watching a 32 " Samsung LCD . Its a old TV , today I replaced it with a 50 " Samsung 4 K LED . I did n't use those 4 extender arms on my 32 " TV , so I kept it on my basement store room . Today , fortunately I found them with all necessary screws ! ! ! Mannn ! This thing is amazing . Within this price , they delivered a very sturdy , swivel mount with all necessary screws & washers ! My 50 " TV needed a different & bigger screws and I found it in this wall mount 's box ! ! ! This is awesome , this THE best ever $ 30 I 've invested . The mount holding my bigger 50 " TV without any problem ! & I can adjust it easily . Once again , I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this inexpensive yet amazing wall mount to any one .
1 #### I 've played EXL110 for years and loved them , using hundreds of sets , but I think something most have changed with the production . I 've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month . All three were on gigs and now I 'm stressed a set wo n't even make it through a whole show . Come on D'Addario .
2 #### This underwater camera was a big disappointment . I took it to take pictures under water on a cruise . The operation was very simple . You wind a knob , you take the picture . We stuck this thing in the water to take pictures of different fish and after we got them developed almost every picture was blurry or unrecognizable . The camera remained water proof but just did n't take good pictures , not even recognizable . The water clarity was in the caribbean and very clear as well , so I do not believe that was a factor . Go with another brand .
4 #### I love these headphones for what they are . They are Semi - Open , great sound , etc . I would n't " record " with these , or listen to them in a room where a lot of people are do to the fact sound leaks . But for gaming alone , and especially for monitor phones they are really good for the price .
5 #### Love JP ! Got these recommended to me by a guy who has at least 4 or 5 instruments worth 30 plus grand and god knows how many other super nice ones . They are wonderful strings . Sound great and last a super long time . Do n't have the nice bass of bluegrass strings or the cut of elixirs , but they are extremely well balanced all around . And most of all , these will last 2 or 3 times as long as others . They deteriorate so slow you do n't really realize it 's happening until you 've gone waaaay to long without changing them . These are the best bang for your buck .
1 #### Mine was DOA X2 . I told Amazon they are defective , and should be pulled from sale .... but here they are . Skip .
5 #### Takes the dust off my car without leaving any streaking that some report with other brands . Just do n't press real hard .
5 #### I bought this for my Martin guitar because I wanted to make certain the wood did n't get too dry in the heat of the summer . It works just as advertised and I have no complaints .
4 #### I purchased this product for my Mini Cooper S sport seat . Product went on well and protect , shines and preserves the leather well . Read and follow the direction and be sure to see what type of leather you have .
5 #### these were a gift for my son ... he loves the sound int these
4 #### This simple usb extension cable seems to be very well made . It has heavy molded connectors and a flexible insulation on the cable . Extended my tablet charging cable and works just as it is supposed to do .
5 #### I am an intermediate cello player still looking for what works best for me . I took the advice of the 5 star reviews especially , " take the chance and spend a few extra bucks " and " works well with carbon fiber bows " . Maybe it 's psychosomatic but I really feel and hear quite a difference between this and the less expensive rosin . I 've tried the light , amber and even gold flake and like the dark the best out of all .
5 #### I bought the Motorola H681 to replace a plantronics Bluetooth that I lost . I was comfortable in purchasing this item because my aunt has the same Motorola bluetooth as well and she uses it all the time ! It feels very comfortable in your ear and the battery life is superb ! You can hear people very clear when having conversations and the pairing to your device is very simple . The one thing you might have to do is change the rubber ear piece , it comes with an additional ear piece that makes it comfortably fit in your ear . The one that they have on there when you take the bluetooth out of the box did n't fit well in my ear and my bluetooth kept falling off of my ear , but once I changed it I have had no problems . I would highly suggest this Motorola H681 to anyone ! It was a great purchase with a great price .
4 #### Everything you could want in an iPhone case is designed into the Commuter EXCEPT for a membrane cover over the silent / vibrate switch . Otherwise , it 's GREAT . You still feel like you have an iPhone while it 's in the Commuter case - not so for the Defender series . BUY THE COMMUTER !
5 #### These were great . I ca n't brag on them enough . I AM however an electric gitty player primarily . I just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting .
5 #### I bought one of these and installed in a cabinet wall on my wife 's side of the bed in our RV so she could plug in her iPad and iPhone for charging overnight . Her side of the bed lacked any electrical outlets , so she had no way to charge her electronic devices . This fit the bill perfectly and she 's one happy camper . I wired it into the 12v system in the RV by tapping into a lighting circuit found nearby .
5 #### Product has great color and package came with no problem . size was accurate and quality is on point . recommend product
4 #### Appears to be well made . Easy to fit . I wo n't give it 5 stars though , because I think that $ 12 is a lot of of money for a small plastic bracket and a slightly modified battery compartment cover , especially when the eTrex only cost me $ 108 over five years ago .
1 #### After two weeks of using the Garmin Carrying Case I put it away , probably for good . The reason for this is that it just simply is not ergonomic . As you can see in the picture , the case butts right up against the menu button and also enter button for the Vista HCx making these buttons very difficult and frustrating to use . It is also very difficult to get the gps unit in and out of the case . It would have been better to have made a ' hard ' case in which the unit was meant to be removed to be used . I bought a small ' fanny ' pack to use instead for geocaching and just put the unit , sans case , in that ; that works out better . I can not recommend this case at all .
5 #### I needed to add another computer to our LAN network at home . I ordered this and it came as notified . Getting it setup was easy and no problems . I have had no problem with this switch and very happy with the performance . I now have four computers on the LAN and this switch keeps on going .
5 #### This lightweight but quality unit has the clarity and features I need to stay in touch with fellow Jeep dudes on our trail runs . The tiny speaker in the Midland handheld I 'd been using just got too frustrating to listen to ; this is a much better way to communicate . Combined with the Firestik Fire - Ring stud and cable and a 3 ' Firefly antenna it 's a rock solid two - way , for not much more total investment than a quality handheld .
5 #### I 've owned quite a few $ 1000 - plus headphones , including the Sennheiser HD-800 's . Available at a very attractive " street price , " the HD-600 are a completely respectable headphone , especially when paired with a good dedicated headphone amplifier . The HD-600 's are not the " last word " in detail , transparency , spatial character or bass reach and definition- but they are VERY GOOD , fairly neutral , having just a slightly dark presentation with good detail and unexaggerated , taut bass . They are also fairly comfortable , well made and pretty rugged . They are nice for classical , acoustic and electric jazz and - unless you are a BASS HEAD and require exaggerated bass- good for rock , techno , hip - hop , etc etc .
5 #### I bought this kit to add an aftermarket stereo to my 1999 Ford Expedition with the Mach system . The instructions were a bit vague , but luckily the color of the wires matched up to the stereo I was installing .
2 #### was unable to have the parts stick correctly on the phone backing . I got worried it would fall off and lose or damage my phone The adhesive was not strong enough to stick on to the cell phone
5 #### I think I am sticking with Marine Band . I recently took up the Harmonica and started with a Special 20 then got a Lee Oskar and a Suzuki Pro . All 3 are good harmonicas and was always iffy about getting the Marine Band version due to all the complaints about the 2 hole draw and stuff . Well one day I finally pulled the trigger and ordered it . After just doing one single note song I found this as my favorite harmonica . Right now I am not using it much for trying to wear out the ones I bought before it . But once they are worn out my intention is just to use the Marine Band .
5 #### Good quality aux cable . Not much to say . The flat cable design allows for tangle free storage - the reason I bought the cable . The connector easily fits into an Iphone with a case . Recommended .
5 #### been using " the abosorber " for about 10 years now , and recommend it to anyone . My last one has seen better days so had to trade in !
5 #### I use these when i am building PCs to keep the cable clutter to a minimum , nice black color blends well inside computer cases .... but you can basically use it to tie down anything you want ...
4 #### The charger is a good idea ... Allows me to change the battery dock to support other batteries from other devices . Hope seidio continues to support this as well as other devices . -1 star for Build quality , although functional seems delicate and flimsy ( Is that correct ? ) . I do not plan on using the USB charging for it , so my model should last longer than most .
3 #### Its OK , takes some getting used to . But otherwise is OK
5 #### Tone and " feel " are often subjective to the player 's ear , so I wo n't comment on those . However , few will argue that Elixir ( either nano or poly ) offer the best longevity . Your strings will sound great throughout the expected life ( how hard you play ) . If you are a professional this review may not pertain to you as I 'm sure you have developed your own preferences by now . However if you are an occasional player ( 3x a week or less ) longevity matters as much as anything else . Asides from that some of the other objective reasons to buy elixirs are : - Easier on fingers - Brightest sounding strings compared to other Coated including D'addario , Cleartones , etc ... - Prevents fret board stains - dampens chord change squeeks or sounds . I 've been playing for 14 years and do n't have a problem switching strings manufacturers . But in my opinion until someone builds a product that sounds as good and lasts as long as Elixirs I will remain a happy customer of theirs .
5 #### Absolutely necessary if you 're using a guitar with the TC - Helicon . Easy to assign functions .
4 #### The ring is a bit too big for my fingers . I put the ring on my middle finger to get the perfect length for my thumb and index finger to hold on to the pick . I got 2 right away . This is such a ingenius design , it 's so easy to hold the pick now without the fear of dropping it in the middle of a song . Before I got this , I used to put a couple of picks in my pocket so if I did drop it while playing , I did n't have to bend down to pick it up . The silicon material is very nice . It does n't scratch your palm or fingers . Very easy to put on and it retains in your hand without any effort . The pick is of medium thickness . Which is molded into the silicon ring holder piece . I like the medium thickness even though I usually use thin ( but breaks often ) . The price is worth it ( even though for just ONE pick ) . The material of the pick itself is very durable and wo n't break easily . The only thing prevented me from giving it 5 star was I expected a green color pick but they shipped me a red one instead . If you switch between finger picking and strumming , this pick is a must have . Highly recommended .
5 #### Just like all the other eggs out there . I shoes these because they are not black . All of my other equipment is black and in black bags etc . so they would be hard to find . The audience tends to hang on to these after I pass them out . I will put promo info on them . Good thing they are so inexpensive .
5 #### Beautiful ! Very lifelike especially since we live on a lake with lots of real mallards !
3 #### If one puts the cover on correctly the first time , they do a decent job . Use it for my GPS , Camera , wife 's phone and flat touch panel on new microwave ( I know ... extreme ) . To cover most of our phones , I 'll only use the Zagg brand .
5 #### Shooting Sporting Events ? Well make sure this lens is present . Pleasantly surprised by the picture quality ! MUST HAVE
5 #### This is an exceptional , portable battery . It is lightweight and provides optimal battery backup . A definite must have . I use my to use the hps function on my bike rides and runs .
5 #### I ordered this item because I needed something to protect my Galaxy S II but could n't find a otterbox or comparable case for my phone . I decided I would just get a simple TPU case for now , and then figure the rest out later . This case fits my phone perfectly . It makes the phone much easier to hold AND the volume / power buttons are much more usable . One issue I had before having this case was turning my volume up on accident when trying to turn the screen off with the power button . If you are looking for a simple case to protect the phone and provide more grip - this is a great choice .
5 #### BEAUTIFUL . This instantly transforms your IPhone into a thing of beauty . I have theone with the white bwe , too . This is just great when you want a little color on your phone .
5 #### I stumbled onto these by accident at a small music store that does well to have picks . I bought them and put them on my National Style O resonator which I play with bare fingers . The sound and the ease of playing was drastic . The sound is clear and the volume fantastic . My fingers slide off of the slightly slippery coating with ease and although it may be wishfull thinking , I think I play faster with fewer mistakes . I would recommend these to anyone who plays and accoustic . For myself , I wo n't be buying anything else for awhile . A word of caution though , allow some extra length when winding these up on the machine head , as they are coated and slippery and need and extra wrap or two on the pegs to keep them from slipping .
4 #### Dose what it was designed to do . Pleased with adapter .
4 #### loved this mouse the only thing i would add is a bluetooth locator for the ball kids are 3,7 , and 8 . so i do n't even know where to start looking
5 #### This thin rubber case is perfect for my use . It keeps the phone from sliding when I set it down , and it 's thin enough to fit within the DLO Leather Holster on my belt . The stand that comes with it is a plus , letting me watch YouTube , etc . Nice product that has protected my phone very well , and held up very well to two years of constant use .
5 #### Works as advertised , does the job of winding the strings , also cuts off excess string after wound and lastly it pulls the pegs on acoustic guitars ! What a great idea in a tool , and it works ! I 'm glad I purchased ! ! ! Also it arrived in 4 days from order date , ca n't beat Amazon ! Thank you again Amazon for another satisfying purchase ! !
5 #### Great headphones ! ! ! Clear and precise sound , very comfortable fit . Sony quality to boot ! ! !
5 #### Great fit and well made product I would recommend this to all . Fit my E-450 great
5 #### Nice color which matches my red and black seat covers . Easy to clean because you can wash them . They do not get so messy like the other ones which are not plastic . I totally recommend them .
5 #### Keeps stuff in the bed of the truck at the tailgate .
2 #### I was so unpleased with this case it went back . First it left a scratch on my phone , then it was nearly impossible to get off . When I finally got it off , it would never stay locked back on . Bottom part kept just coming off in my hand . What drove me the most nuts though , was that being a smooth case , if I set my phone on anything with even the mildest slant , my phone took off . * woosh * Thank goodness for the rubber body glove !
3 #### I tried this lens out when looking for a low - cost telephoto lens for my Digital Rebel XT , side - by - side with the USM version , the IS version , and several L - series lenses in similar focal lengths ( the latter being but a pipe dream and way out of my budget at the time ) . In short , if you want a lens with a long reach and have next to nothing to spend , this might be the lens for you . I 'd suggest spending the extra money on the USM version for the slightly - faster focusing -- it 's really just a pittance more , unlike the IS lens ( although not appreciably sharper than this lens ) . Photos are remarkably soft , particularly toward the 300 mm end . If you want this lens for nature and sports photography , be prepared for a lot of work in Photoshop to get something sharp enough to use ( and forget about professional - quality prints ) . The focus is very slow , and the lens itself rather slow throughout its range -- and particularly at 300 mm , where you 're going to be locked into f5.6 . This means longer exposure times and/or requires better lighting , which limits its usefulness for capturing action at any distance . Personally , I 'd save up a bit more or else rent a better lens if you immediately need something in this focal range . However , if you 're okay with the softness -- perhaps you 're only doing portraiture and want to put your camera halfway across the room?--and can deal with the other limitations , the lens is very affordable .
5 #### Good cover will protect your device against drops and scuffs .
5 #### All of us in the boat shed use this product . Does a very good job .
5 #### Finally found a case for my Motif ES6 . I never had anything other than SKB hard cases , however they were too heavy for local gigging so I went through a few Yamaha Motif ES6 bags which Yamaha does n't make anymore . I loved those and they lasted for a good 2 - 3 years before tearing . When my last one broke I did n't want Gator because the cases I had seen at Guitar Center had absolutely no protection / foam on the inside and I was I was like why would I put my expensive synth in this ? So I bought the SKB equivalent which had way more padding , but the quality was not the SKB quality I had known . The zipper holder / puller broke off within the first week . The bag started tearing within the first 2 months , and the actual zipper lining was bad within 4 months . Worst keyboard bag purchase ever ! ! After some periodic searching and not wanting to spend $ 200 on a soft case I went to reading tons of reviews and found this case . This case is excellent ! ! Plenty of protection and fits my Motif which there are barely any soft cases for out there . I now have a new found respect for Gator ! So glad they upped the quality from when I first checked them out 10 years ago .
5 #### I have another SHURE mic that I paid more for ( the 48 model) ... this one is much more sensitive and works great ! Highly recommended !
5 #### This is one of those things were you say .... why did n't I think of this ! It is a very simple thing but does exactly what it is meant to do . I use it on my bedside table and place my iPhone in it and use the phone as an alarm clock . I have also used it on a plane on the tray table to watch a movie . It folds up and can fit in your wallet .
4 #### These things are fantastic for the price and portability . I bought them because I hate ear buds and wanted something with more oomph but without the clumsiness of wrap around headsets so I could walk and listen to music on my cell phone . Very nice bass and treble with a little loss on the mid range . I have always loved Koss and these are no exception . Recommended
5 #### Solid and compact built , fits into the narrow smart - switching panel built in the wall of my laundry room . Always runs cool , so far with no heat dissipation issue .
3 #### Product works but does not " feel good " in hand and response from the touch screen is only fair . I continue to use my fingers for easier data entry and screen selections .
5 #### These headphones work great and are inexpensive ... it 's a win - win for me !
4 #### This is a very nice recorder . It came in a clear protective case , which is great . There were some very , very brief instructions that I could not understand at all , so I 'm going to have to go on the internet to look for better instructions . This is why I 'm not giving it 5 starts .
4 #### Works very well on my cloth convertible top . Follow directions and you should be all set . No offensive odors and it worked to remove some bird poo .
5 #### For the product I leave a lot of stars for it because it is a very high quality string . This is my first time trying this brand and I am so pleased with the quality . I think the sound of these strings for my guitar is not the best fit though , for the tone I am trying to get out of it ( music nerd stuff ) . The strings really bring the mids out of the guitar with a more Mild tone that provides good sustain and a nice warm sound . The guitar I put them on has a maple back and sides , maple being good a reproducing treble sounds . And this guitar soars on treble and mids . Not so much with bass . If it were a primarily basswood ( mahogony , rosewood , etc ) guitar I guess the strings would sound great on the guitar and I 'd continue using them . But as it is I 've lost that High end awesome tone that made me stop using coated strings because they reproduced less of it . So I was using plain non coated strings before of a different brand and just heard these and their quality . Well I found out the quality of these is GREAT , but just not the reproducing the tone i want for this one guitar . I would try them again on my other acoustic for sure . If you like the Milder tones and Warmth , etc these are a sure bet !
3 #### kinda clunky to use and the cutter is n't the best .
4 #### These headphones are great , but I could have saved $ 90 if I just kept using my , Panasonic RP - HTF600 - S Stereo Headphones , instead of looking for " a better " pair of headphones to buy . Also , these Sony headphones have the heavy coil wire which gets to be a little uncomfortable . The heavy coil wire makes it feel more tense as if the headphones are being pulled off your ears .
4 #### Works exactly as advertised . Great for conf calls at home to keep hands free . Mute button works great . Use it on my home cordless phone and my blackberry with no problems .
5 #### Bought this about 60 days ago and it 's been my primary lens since . This is by far the sharpest lens we have and with the biggest aperture . Just yesterday was at our daughter 's dance rehearsal and no flashes were allowed . I tried to use the 28 - 135 telephoto that came with the camera but it 's was just way too dark . Moved back a few rows and slapped on this baby and everything became so much brighter and I got some really good action shots at 1600 ISO . By the way , the Canon 40D is so good that 1600 ISO shots are useable . As to the macro function , it 's great . For small insects you will need a monopod , a steady hand , and manual focus .
4 #### This barrier is perfect for my ford escape and allows me to bring my dog anywhere easily without having to lug his huge crate around . He is a year old 65 lb black lab and this barrier works well to keep him in the back of my car . I gave it four stars because the instructions were hard to follow and we found some typing errors which meant we pretty much had to put the thing together ourselves . It was fine but took a bit longer . Once it was put together , it was easy to install in the car with two people and does n't effect my driving .
4 #### Good strings , use them on my Taylor and always sound good while lasting a long time with moderate play .
5 #### Air bags work very well , with a long wheel base truck and a 36 ' fifth wheel the head lights were either coon hunting or blinding on coming traffic , the air bags leveled my truck NICE
5 #### gift for my father inlaw perfect fitment on his highlander
5 #### Sound great , very comfortable and good price . Have held up very well over in and out of my pocket and briefcase . Recommended .
4 #### I normally use the smaller recharge kit ( white bottle ) but since i ran out , I bought this spray and the bigger oil can to match . I used it on a k&n filter I had never cleaned and unlike the other white bottle cleaner , it did not completely remove the oil , so it is hard to say I 'm 100 % satisfied . I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter . Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be , but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it wo n't be for a while . Since i do n't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular ( non synthetic ) k&n filter cleaner , if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that . In this case the problem could be the filter , I have bought a few of the white recharge kits so I know how to clean filters . Time will tell
5 #### Very good quality . I measured the edge diameter of my spare tire ( underneath the bed of my pickup ) . Came in at 30.5 " , so I thought this cover would fit . Found out later that the ' center ' diameter of the inflated tire was greater than 31 " and the cover would not fit . I returned this cover and ordered the " XX - Large " cover ( for tires 33 " in diameter ) . Waiting for it to arrive . Note to others , when you measure your tire diameter , make sure you measure across the tire from the center of the tread .
5 #### Heavy duty . I used this to lock my fifth wheel plate to the mount . It took 4 locks and I metal stamped the keys to match the lock position .
5 #### i like this blue tooth head set , i had it before . good price . it does give me any problems , i can hear perfectly fine on this .
5 #### I 've had a change to try these as well as some 80/20 Elixir Nanoweb strings . As expected the Phosphor Bronze sounded warmer and richer right from the get go . They squeak less than uncoated strings which is a nice side benefit . Guitar strings do n't seem to last me long enough to make the investment in longer lasting strings worth it . When they break I change them .
5 #### They 're perfect for me . So far they appear to be sturdy and the sound is great . They 're comfortable , but I have n't worn them over an hour yet so no idea how long they stay comfortable for . Getting back to the sound quality , they sound great , I 'm very pleased with them . The Higs are hih , midrange is very good and the bass is adequate , for the price you wo n't go wrong .
5 #### I thought " non - laminated " mean dull surface . It is pretty high gloss . Silver has slight pearl color shift to it . Very nice !
5 #### My first Shubb Capo has lasted 30 years . I bought this new one for a second guitar . The quality of these capos has remained robust and I could not be more pleased !
5 #### The Natural Keyboard is a great if not the best egronomic keyboard out there . Its easy to use and get used to and once you get used to egronomic keyboards , regular keyboards are terrible to use . There are 19 completely programmable hotkeys , including 7 internet , 1 mail , 8 media and hotkeys for My COmputer , Calculator and Sleep . The Hotkeys are very easy to get used to and are fairly easy to set - up . As said before they are completely customizable so any hotkey will open up an program you wish .
5 #### My company ordered a couple of these for use in our prototype motorcycle . It was easy to install and is sufficiently loud for a motorcycle . The horn uses simple 1/4 " FASTON style connections for easy installation , and comes with a mounting bracket .
5 #### My teen daughter has been learning to play guitar for almost a year and the capo that she previously had was very flimsy . Her teacher recommended Dunlop brand so I ordered this hoping it was a good investment . We are very happy with the quality and the way it holds the strings ( I also play guitar ) . The grip is comfortable and easy to move at any time . Definitely worth the price , it looks like it could last a while . Very pleased with the product .
3 #### A good read ! I would read it again if I had time . A lot of adventure and excitement . Great read for on the train .
2 #### The idea of a case and holster combo is great , however it just did n't work in my case . The slider case fits well over the iPhone , however when you put it into the holster , then try to remove it , the slider case comes apart EVERY TIME . It seems that the locking mechanism on the slider case is just poorly designed . It is possible that I just received a defective one ..... if that is the case then I would highly receommend this product . If the one I received is typical of this design , then I would not recommend this product .
5 #### I have the other types for my acoustic guitars . For my Strat this works great . It has ends that keep the guitar from sliding forward . I do n't know what they are called , but the come off and can be adjusted . Great guitar hanger for electric . also keeps close to the wall
1 #### The horn failed after about 3 weeks . It was a particularly rainy 3 weeks . I suspect that it is not as water resistant as the OEM horn . The original low tone horn lasted 8 years , and the high tone is still going strong .
1 #### RECIEVED ON TIME BACK COVER WAS BROKEN ASKED FOR ANOTHER ONE AND THEY SENT ME A PINK COVER SERIOUSLY WTH THE THE HONE IT SELF STOP WORKING WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HORRIBLE DONT WWASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ITH THESE PEOPLE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL .
5 #### A must for small two stroke engines . I mix it with fuel , plus if needed for a fouled cylinder / plug , drizzle a little into the spark plug hole reinstall plug and crank up for a clean out .
5 #### Great price and great product . I 'm a big fan of these KC slim lites and will order them again if I can find more space to mount additional pairs . Installation was easy and their light pattern is perfect
1 #### I 've had mine for a year and here 's what we got . It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me . This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed ( according to this GPS ) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead . There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half ( of about 50 ) have crashed to an un - recoverable state . Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time . Really ? it 's a truck driver GPS . We have one driver with a $ 2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road . The companies response was to update the unit . I 've had mine for a year , I never noticed one update that corrected functionality , they only seem to keep messing the tools . I want a GPS that routes , if I wanted tools I 'd buy software for my computer . My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen . My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks . Wayne
5 #### This little gem was exactly what I needed for my 6 year old daughter . Previously I purchased two other digital metronomes . The first had an annoying beep instead of a click sound . The 2nd was way too difficult to actually change the tempo quickly . You had to push a series of buttons even to increase the tempo by one bpm . This one sounds right and is extremely easy to use . My daughter increases the tempo with one hand as she progresses . It feels sturdy too !
4 #### Its alright , not much legnth from the sensor to the gauge . Its a tight strech if you have a truck or suv . Worst part about it is the bracket , its awkward and hard to mount the screws unless you have plenty of room .
5 #### Works great and the long flexible spout tube reaches where my fingers ca n't ! !
4 #### This is a quality network patch cord that should prove dependable through the coming years . I have purchased patch cords from this manufacturer in the past and found no issues with quality before . I would recommend for purchase .
4 #### Not that great ... of course they are original , but I use a lot of bends and these make a little noise when I do them , I tried a lot of solutions but its just the design :/
5 #### This is the industry standard microphone for a dynamic microphone . Very tough and it can stand daily use for a year now and it still looks like new . Worth the extra money over similar microphones on Amazon . This is the real deal you see on stage at concerts .
3 #### worked ok for a few months then started bugging out
5 #### Please note that for 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan , do not buy the item Metra 70 - 6522 . This is the correct one . Installation notes for sharing : [ ... ]
5 #### If you do n't have a voltmeter in your dashboard , this is a good way to know beforehand if your alternator is about to take a dump , so you do n't get stranded . The device takes a minimal amount of space and could n't be easier to use . For the price it does the job perfectly .
4 #### Great sound ! Clean and nice bass . Works with iPhone 6 , but there seems to be some connection issues that produce statics .
5 #### todo muy bien lo recomiendo es mejor de lo que esperaria empresa responsable y llego tal como el vendedor me informo y funsiona muy bien con todas las operadoras en venezuela muy contento
5 #### Great picks . I used to love Planet Waves with the little grips . Every one of them broke . I have played guitar for 20 + years and had never broken a pick before . I have gone back to Fender .
4 #### I still ca nt get it to fit properly , even though I have tried all of the provided sizes , I bought two , my friend is having the same problem .
5 #### This bag holds my nikon FM3a with a Tamaron 24 - 135 zoom perfectly . There is just enough room left inside that I can squish my neck strap in there too . I 've also found that the outside pocket has room to hold three film canisters . This bag is great if you want to fling your camera over your shoulder for a quick walk to the park or a trip to a ball game .
4 #### A bit small for a DSLR with a couple kit lenses . I 've outgrown it . I will go bigger soon .
5 #### Got this to polish my Glock internals . Works as advertised .
4 #### I have had them before . So I knew what I was getting . It is hard to find these at Walmart or even better , Radio Shack .
5 #### We love it-------it keeps the loaded log trucks coming down our icy , mountain road from smacking us . It has over a one mile range on a twisted , turning road thru a canyon . Clear reception is impressive .
5 #### Been buying guitar strings a very long time ... these are some of th best ever ! Beautiful tone ; No buzz ; very little break - in time for stretch & tuning . Over a month later and still holding tune extremely well ( minor adjustments only ) and no oxidation has started at all . Highly recommend these high quality strings !
5 #### If you like to listen to AM talk radion , sports or news this radio is unbeatable . I have the Sony ICF SW7600GR and the AM section ca n't hold a candle to the Superadio III . Personally I think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found . I am amased that this unit gets the job done for $ 40.00 . It does what it says . Hope this is helpful .
5 #### shielded , and fast better than a usual RJ14 phone cord . For the feed to the phone modum it helps o keep what signal u have
4 #### Very nice phone , only that it does not carried wi - fi . I brought this phone for a friend of mine , who had asked me to get him a phone , he is very happy with it and has no problems
5 #### This is awesome . I got the effect I wanted . Very well made .
4 #### Good . It is a little long for my Epi Les Paul 100 . But the strings are in place correctly
5 #### not much to say , good ties for organizing cords either behind or inside PC .
5 #### Rating a DI box is like rating how well your fork and spoon work . It does what it is supposed to do without issue , dependable . The ' lift ' switch is great for those venues where buzz becomes a problem . It eliminates the nightmare for the sound guys !
5 #### Bought this because I lived on an area that had no to one bar . This boosted it to a solid one , two and sometimes third bar . I was able to send text and make phone calls .
1 #### I knew going into this product it may be just one of those things . This was an acceptable loss . This does nt make a difference . If anyone finds anything please let me know , thanks .
4 #### Replace my GMCs 1975 old quad jet , and now runs good .
3 #### Needed it for overseas travelling and it worked great . Until , I forgot I put it in my back pocket , which I never do , and sat on it .
5 #### I LOVE THESE ! ! I can check my makeup while at my desk , on a date , or anywhere ! ! There 's a glare when your in the sun , but WHO CARES ! ! Lol ! ! If you want to turn your phone into a mirror because you have it in your hand all the freaking time anyway , PURCHASE THESE SCREEN PROTECTORS . :-D
5 #### Used it to hide speaker cables and now it looks like its just part of the floor boards .
5 #### If you decide to purchase this camera , understand that you are not selecting a point - and - shoot digital camera . This compact camera is a full featured package designed with the 35 mm photographer in mind . It comes with a complete set of controls -- everything from fully automated exposure to manual control , autofocus and accessory lens . As a result it reacts to your needs and requirements in much the same way as a Nikon 35 mm SLR would . Therein lies the rub ; to fully exploit the 990 's features and capabilities , you have to work with it . The more you use it , the more you will like it .
5 #### Great for inside the travel trailer and the tow rig !
4 #### We have the old Nook reader , which we love . We purchased this Nook at target for the same price as Barnes and Noble and Amazon . This Nook is smaller , which is nice . It has a built in light , which is really nice . And , it is touch screen , which is awesome ! The only flaw I see thus far is that you ca n't resize the letters . Apparently the letters are a standard size , I assume because of the size of the screen ? Anyway , I would like to make them smaller so that I can read more before turning the page . However , that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new Nook tremendously .
5 #### This is good because it does n't have to be stuffed into a console . It works very well .
3 #### Does what I need and what it was mad to do . I purchased this radio to communicate with traffic control people ( i.e. flaggers ) on gas well access roads . My second need was to be easily interchangable between vehicles . Not a whole lot of distance using the 10 inch Rubber Duck Mobile but more than the antenna that comes with the radio , Amazon makes you believe that you need an antenna adapter with this radio . ! ! ! You Do Not ! ! ! Also the radio pickes up a lot of engine noise for the lack of a proper ground to the vehicle but in a slow moving vehicle it works just fine .
5 #### Although it took a while for me to get the device to pick up the satellites , once I did it was all it promises to be . This one is great because it fits in your pocket
5 #### This is the perfect inexpensive pump for bike tires . It works great . I bought it for my grandchildren who have managed to break every pump I purchase in a short amount of time . This one works great , and did not break the bank .
5 #### I bought this and plugged it in and have been using it without issues ever since . I 'd buy this again .
5 #### The adapter function is exactly what was needed to bridge the gap for the earlier Sidewinder flight simulater control stick game port connector to using a USB port . This allows one to use later computers without a game port .
4 #### Not as bright as elixrs but much better steel composition . More durable .
5 #### This is just the right size for putting my photos in for gift giving .
1 #### This tool is poorly made . The gapping portion is weak sheet metal that bends immediately . Feeler gauges would be a better choice .
4 #### good item , just sticky enough to hold items without them moving around on the dash of my car . Not soo sticky that the pad picks up everytime with the item you want to remove from the pad .
5 #### I already had one of these units , the motorhome had a power surge and it got fried . This unit was the replacement , the unit at the RV place was $ 1100 and on amazon it was $ 650 . If you do n't have a amazon prime accout get one it is worth it .
5 #### Bought to replace the green filters oil and it does a great job .
5 #### I 'll never use any other strings . Nobody can change my mind .
5 #### Esta camara la he comprado por que puedo grabar todas las fotos en discos flexibles , solo es cargar en el carro una caja de discos y tienes para cientos de fotos , una buena idea de la marca . Me ha gustado mucho y la he disfrutado mucho .
5 #### I bought this item for my curved soprano sax and it does a fine job of cleaning moisture out of the horn . The weight has enough heft to get through the horn without getting stuck . You can use it with the neck of the horn attached , if you wish . Drop the weight through the bell and pull it out through the neck . You may find that some pads still have moisture on them . I use strips of a paper towel to get the last drops of water from a few pads that tend to get the most moisture ( like the left - hand palm keys at the top of the horn ) .
3 #### Nothing wrong with this OEM filter - but does not fit a 2006 E450 V10 - even though this is what the owner manual calls out . Can is way too large to fit into the filter holder .
4 #### One star off because the packaging picture looks like condoms AND there 's no cure for the string buzz you get no matter what , but they 're still really good . I ca n't believe how long they stay tuned , too .
5 #### It does the job . Get one can for each wheel well .
4 #### They shipped fast so receiving them quick was a plus . But the screws are cheaply made and did n't stay screwed in my car . Also they bend permanently after some time depending on how low you install them . I ended up just taking them off by hand since the screws are crap . They looked nice while they were on though
5 #### Got this lense with my dslr camera I ordered for those long shots . Mounted up perfect and was able to put it to use right away
5 #### Work great on my tablet or Iphone . Ca n't believe they are this inexpensive . Work just like as if I 'd paid full price .
5 #### I bought this for my son 's Nikon . He has been using it for several weeks and is very happy with the results . Great flash for the price .
5 #### This strap kicks butt i m a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if I have it to max its TO LONG that never happened to me and i m 6 4 300 LBS so if your tall buy it do n't waste your time with the Planet Wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage
1 #### this was a waste of money . used these on a snorkeling trip in catalina island . I should have just purchased a water proof camera and returned it to target or something when I was done with it . the quality of these pictures were horrible . do n't waste your money on these if you think you are going to be preserving memories .
5 #### This card is easy to install and it 'll work right after you install the driver and restart your system ( 95 , 98 , 98se) ... Don't fall with the [ inexpensive]NIC , go with BUS MASTERING ..... it 'll make you happy !
5 #### I really like the clear and bright sound . Looks pretty durable compared to traditional reeds . This is not PLASTIC but coated with some plastic - y paint .
5 #### Very happy with it , and data transfer to my printer is fast on my older computer . Belkin makes a good product ; I have had a Belkin 4 - slot flash card reader for some time and love it . The price was almost too good to be true but it 's great , most places wanted a lot more up to $ 30 for a 10 " USB cable . The first one I bought had the wrong kind of connector ends ( another vendor ) . My bad , did n't do my homework well enough . Delivery was fast . I 'd like another one for my other computer so I do n't have to pull it out of the back of the tower but just the printer slot to switch and print from my other computer ( my two are networked to get on the internet thru a router but wo n't " talk " to each other ) . But for many print jobs , I can easily find a way around that for now .
3 #### This operated as advertised . It 's quite small ( a bit bigger than a hockey puck ) and light ( no batteries ) , which made it a little hard to make it stay put in some cases . The sound quality is not perfect ; if you wanted to make business calls , I think you might be disappointed .
5 #### This is a standard USB A to B connector , the type that is typically used for printers or larger peripheral devices . I 've been using it for a while to connect my printer , seems to work exactly as intended . Unlike most USB cables this one is a dark gray , makes it easy to identify in the mess .
4 #### Ca nt find this in stores anymore . Camera works great and have film for it to use in my daughter 's class .
5 #### Good quality hose for less money / ft than local parts stores . Nice to have plenty on hand not just 3 ft in a plastic bag like often sold in the stores .
5 #### Coleman makes pretty good cables . I bought these because everyone should have jumpers in their car . My car luckily died twice at home , but next time I might not be as lucky . These will revamp your car quick . Its a decent guage too .
2 #### Did not like this at at the phone is small and looks very very outdated it can with a charger that ca nt go in the wall . I really was an unsatisfied customer .
5 #### This bag is designed for the smallish Apple Creek dulcimer . Do not think it will fit other instruments . It protects the dulcimer well and has a zippered pouch to put your tuner , picks , and other items in . I really like it .
4 #### Very Good for the price . Will buy these again , for sure ! Decent audio bandwidth , too - Good base , good highs , too .
3 #### I would say that product did its job very well . I have 4 stars because one needs to really press and hold for sometime in order for the homebutton to get clicked while using phone inside cover Also its not easy to type while the phone is inside the cover as the edges of the cover really prevents from selecting the right key pf apple on screen keybpard I just remove the phone from cover if I have to play games and or text ... But its a good protective cover and provides adequate cushion for the phone . I have dropped my phone twice while it was inside the cover but did n't affect a bit even when it was a fall to a rough ground
5 #### These are great , I have them on all my guitars . Of all the styles of strap locks I 've tried , this style allows the strap to move with you , which is nice . The U style clips have a more restrictive feel to them , but not these .
5 #### I love the Jim Dunlop Tortex Picks , and use nothing else . So much better than regular plastic . They seem to be impervious to sweat , and do not lose their grip when you sweat . They are smooth , yet somehow allow you to grip the pick gently without it slipping or turning . Great to be able to order them in bulk on Amazon at much better prices than retail .
1 #### These are not elixir strings they are n't coated with anything ! ! !
5 #### I am an earbud fan for portable use and after buying quite a few sets of earbuds in the last few years these are easily my favorite earbuds . They sound very balanced and clear , and provide very good bass for earbuds . The MX500 are also comfortable to wear for long periods of time . Using the RadioShack foam earbud pads helps the bass and comfort quite a lot .
5 #### I 've had these for some years ... Ordered them off of Amazon awhile back to use while PC gaming . Rediscovered them last night for use on Xbox 1 gaming , WOW .. they 're still crisp after all this time . Definitely worth it if you are a wired headphones kind of person .
4 #### Nice texture . They do n't slip when your fingers get damp from sweat . A little more texture would be even better .
2 #### Not the real deal . You would be better off to get an early 70 's silver face and have a tech black face it . Just a few component changes on a early 70 's silver face and you have something far better than this reissue model .
5 #### I was told i had to get some sort of mud flaps for my truck to pass inspection next time . Because the tires stuck out of the fender wells too much . So I did n't care what type of mud flaps i got . However Since i have a Ford F-150 . I decided to get these ford Logo mud flaps . Now they are simple and flat , but they are made with some sort of rubber and fiberglass construction so they are stiff ( a good thing ) . For the price I do think these are higher quality than i expected . So good buy at a good price !
5 #### Perfect size funnel . It is great for adding Transmission Oil . I recommend it to others .
5 #### Easy to order and seafoam is amazing for carbs etc .
4 #### I bought this one in 2004 ( 7 years ago ) . I still use it every week , and it works just like it did on Day 1 .
3 #### I am sad to say this product only does half of what I was told it would do . Unless mine is just messed up , it charges with a USB cable to your computer but does not sync . Also is also another minor problem ... there are no 2 color LEDs to show charging or fully charged . The front LED is white and stays that way as long as it is plugged in no matter if the phone is in the cradle or out of the cradle , as well as if it is charging or fully charged . ( I thought that this might be because I was charging using the USB cable so I tried the plug and still white ) . Overall it looks good but the 3 stars are because it does n't sync which even on the BB site it says it will do .
4 #### I really liked this story ........ the country star falling in love with the cook was really a good storyline . The only thing I did n't really like and the reason for the 4 star was the lyrics from a made up country singer and the recipes from a made up cook after every chapter . It really was n't necessary and did n't add to the story .
5 #### Thie cable is so affordable and so rich for its price . It works great and i was very impressed by the packaging !
3 #### I ordered these and recieved them a day after the estimated time given , i was n't so mad about that . As always i 'm glad to reiceve any packages in my mail slot , i opened up the cute packaging for the screen protector and immediatly applied them to my iphone 4s , the protectors are cute a little akwardly . The screen protector has to be placed at a certain angle for it to fit the correct holes on the phone . The bottom keeps lifting up due to the screen protector being cut strange . It 's a sharp angle cut on the bottom corner instead of a rounded out corner so it lifts almost immediatly .
4 #### Works . Keeps a call miles beyond where I usually lose calls into the mountains . A little tricky to set up the cradle
4 #### I canceled my ground phone service as many people did . However cell phone is a radio and it is unstable in some week signal areas . This Booster is alternative to Microcell of AT@T ( which required Internet ) and does not require any additional connections . It just boost your cell phone signal in limited area in radius at least 30 feet from antennas . Here what I did . I had no idea where is the cell phone transceiver tower so I found most powerful spot with maximum signal bars with my cell phone near window , mounted cradle antenna with logo sign facing window , mounted cable from this antenna across the room to amplifier , connected " on board " antenna ( cable about 4feet with desktop antenna ) to the amplifier and moved away from amplifier as far as possible facing logo on this antenna in opposite side to first one ( back to back ) . I got green light immediately and 6 - 7 bars instead 2 - 3 . It works great if you are between antennas in direct sight . When I go to another room I have 3 - 4 bars and only one wall between cell phone and antennas . So did it solve my problem - yes for 90 % but still there was not stable sound when I talked on the phone but much clear though . Did it boost in 15 times - no . It can help but not for 100 % . So IMO the price should be adequate OR 100 % result . PS It worked with AT@T , cell Nokia 5800
5 #### Rock solid , no leaks , no problems with the connection leaking .
5 #### AWESOME , PERFECT SIZE , WELL MADE & AWESOME PRICE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I can only repeat what everyone else has already said : this Kyser capo is designed and built very well . It 's easy to put on and adjust , and just as easy to take off . There are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier , but this is still pretty stylish . And the price makes it a real bargain .
4 #### This helped to get my Honda Rebel running again after what I suspect was a clogged carburetor . It 's not going to take the place of an actual cleaning of it , but it is a start .
5 #### these strings are great . I play 35 ( or so ) times a year in an acoustic trio and one set per year has done it for me . love the hex core , and the coating never ever separates from the winding . love these strings .
5 #### this kit is great it fixes a door that is wore out . the bushings wear out and the door sags . i replaced mine in about 1 hr .
5 #### Works as it should . Turns the inverter on and off in my camper . What more can I say . Oh ! and the status lights are a good visual aid also .
4 #### I picked these headsets up today at my local Comp USA(Tiger Direct store ) . I needed them because Apple came out with 3.0 for my i Touch which turned on the Bluetooth . Now I can listen to music directly without wires . these headsets paired up with my HP xv5220us laptop , Acer Aspire one , and my i Touch easily . The sound is good and the range is 25 to 30 feet away . I have been wearing them for over an hour and they are comfortable . I only charged them for about 45 mins so I do n't know yet how long the charge lasts . I paid $ 29.95 for them which is a good price .
5 #### Being a former ham radio operator in the 60 's , I appreciate the features GE put back in their " SUPERRADIO " that used to be standard . The best is the tuned RF stage that pulls in distance stations with ease . Second is the dual power feature : a line cord comes built in , and in battery mode , it takes 6 " D " cells so they last a very long time . Third , Two loudspeakers give amazing sound quality and volume . It 's hard to believe you can buy this for under $ 50.00 ! This is a great radio and I will be buying more for Christmas presents .
5 #### good product but if it is too close to the exhaust it will want to melt
4 #### I 'm surprised how much I use this . It seems like kind of an iffy item . I originally bought this so I could watch videos on my iPhone when I travel ( rail or air ) . I rarely used it for that -- it just seemed too lame to bust it out on a flight . I use it almost every day at work though . I listen to music on my iPhone ( mostly Pandora ) and like to see the contents as the songs change . Then if my phone rings , I just leave the earbuds in and talk " at " my phone as if it were a speaker phone . It 's much easier for the caller to hear me if my phone is perched in the iZel . So is it the coolest thing ever ? Not necessarily . I do n't even want anyone to see it , because the idea seems kind of lame . But I still end up using it almost all the time . NOTE : The price was lower when I bought mine . I 'm not sure I 'd pay the current $ 24 .
5 #### My mother recently lost her Rugby II charger while on a trip , so she was reduced to only being able to charger her phone while in the car . I nabbed this for her and they 've done the job admirably . The build quality is decent , definitely better than some of the other cheap chargers you could be stuck with at this price point , and they 've all done exactly what they were bought to do . For the price paid , you could do a whole lot worse .
5 #### This strap is value for money . I was surprised when I got it - I did n't expect something so good at this price ! The material is shiny , blue and does n't look cheap and the strap is generously wide . The ends are leather with one side having a golden EB logo . Goes well with my black Squier Strat . Highly recommended !
5 #### These feel great to me . Buy them if you like a heavy pick that is n't super heavy .
4 #### I am a huge fan of the Chromebook . This book is good , if you want to know more about the Chromebook this little book is packed full of information .
5 #### A good power extension . It 's color coded for easy use with TV & DVD , cable , but we just use it for other needed extension cord . The connections are snug , which is good and on /off switch lets you turn off at night to save electricity . Monster brand is good , Buy with confidence .
5 #### Works great and is a cheap alternative from having to try and find and buy specific nike+ shoes
3 #### I ordered these based on one reviewer stating they were short , 3 inches . All four were 3 FEET long . Other than the length not being mentioned in the description , these are good cables . For me shorter would have been better .
1 #### One charger did n't work and the other ( the car one ) fell apart soon after I bought it . Waste of money . Only useful thing was the usb cable but I already own a bunch of them .
5 #### Arrived quickly , it fits and was very reasonably priced . I have only had it for about 6 weeks so I can not speak to its durability .
5 #### Works better then the wireless version the wireless version has lag and audio some times is laged behind also I think with with the wireless version there must be some compression going on or signal loss because the wired version the quality of picture is ever so slightly better with high quality files
3 #### The unit itself is fine . Everything works except my unit is stuck with the daylight savings time schedule from the last century . For instance , when the rest of the world changes to Daylight Savings time on the second Sunday in March , I have to MANUALLY adjust the time . Then when the first Sunday in April rolls around , the stupid clock jumps forward an hour , and I have to set it back . Sort of annoying . Otherwise , it 's a good clock radio . And of course , The website in the user manual ( [ ... ] ) does n't exist .
5 #### Does wonders ! I work in an area that has patchy or no signal . As long as I have my phone ( Verizon - iPhone 7plus ) in the cradle , I always have a signal and am able to make phone calls . However , data sometimes is slow . But I bought it for phone calls .
1 #### I saw the TV commercial for WeatherTech floor mats and was intrigued by the " custom fit to your vehicle " claims they made . I went to their website and ordered what was supposed to be mats for my 2004 Lexus IS300 . I paid nearly $ 100 and basically received a universal set of rubber mats that had to be cut - down with scissors to barely fit in my car . Even after all the cutting , they still did n't fit quite right . The worst part was that last night , my accelerator pedal got caught under the mat lip and was stuck in the floored position . I was going 60 mph in a 25 mph zone . I quickly had to throw the car into neutral , slam on my brakes and reach down to dislodge the pedal from the mat . Had I not done this , I could have seriously injured myself or others . These mats are coming out of my car immediately and I will never order from their site again . Not only do I feel ripped - off by their deceptive advertising , but they also just put my life in danger .
5 #### I 'm not sure what is special about the detergent or the oil , but the cleaning and re - oiling kit works as promised . I clean and re - oil my K&N filters only about every 10 K miles , but could go longer I think . I like knowing my engine is not starving for air so do n't let it go longer .
5 #### I drive a car with well over 200,000 miles on it . I frequently end up under it trying to break bolts free . These stands easily and securely hold the weight of the car . The extra pin to lock the stands in position gives you that extra piece of mind when trying to get those stubborn bolts . A quality set of stands are a must for anyone who works on cars and these are a nice safe set .
1 #### Sent it back in just under a month as the phone stopped taking a charge . Got my $ back at least .
5 #### I 've always made do with carrying around or hunting down wrecutters and a separate string wonder . What a hassle carrying around 2 items seems after using this little guy .
5 #### These are my strings of choice . I use these on my Taylor acoustic guitar and they give it a nice warm tone without being too bright . They last quite a long time depending how much you play and how well you take care of them . They are a bit expensive but with guitar strings it makes all the difference . They will drastically improve your sound and you will know when they need replaced because your beautiful sounding guitar sounds dull and unimpressive . You do n't need a new guitar , just a new set of good strings . I highly recommend these .
5 #### Worked well to connect my microphone to my camera allowing me to film and record audio and video for interviews .
5 #### If you have any of these bikes , you need this book . I use it for everything .
4 #### Not my first set . They sound great and last forever as long as you are not a really forceful strummer with a heavy pick .
5 #### The E fork is a good reality check for me on all of my string instruments . So is floats from one case to another and is used as needed .
5 #### I bought this to use with my Droid phone . It works great with the existing charger and to sync files on my computer .
5 #### Turned a 20 minute weekly job on the RV to a 5 minute job .
5 #### Perfect companion to my Samsung Galaxy 3 . Use them all the time , so much easier than using your fingers .
4 #### works as advertised , needs a different off /on voltage so as not to have chatter when in the single voltage zone
5 #### These were my first online stick purchase but they were balanced ! Normally I go into the music store and whack the floor to test for vibrations and tone but these were a matched good sounding pair as expected .
5 #### these strings made my Taylor fun to play again ! I did n't really like playing my acoustic after playing my electrics , so If you 're struggling with your acoustic try these strings !
5 #### Replaced the Ventshades that had been on the jeep for 14 yrs . More than got our moneys worth with the old ones .
4 #### This neck strap seems to be a quality product but it did not work for me . I ordered the regular which is fine for someone in Jr. High , but I 'm an adult and this is too short for me and my tenor sax . I wish the write - up would have been clearer and gone into more detail . I have ordered , and received the XL version which fits nicely for me and I have some length to play with . I like the neck strap very much .
4 #### I bought this because I did n't want to install a hard mount cb . I park on the street . When I park at night all I do is slide it out of the holder and take with me just like my radio face plate . Volume output is barely adequate . I like how the acc plug and exterior ant are integrated into one piece . Makes it easy to talk feel like you have mike on regular cb . I like the buttons for Dual watch and scan which are easy to press by feel when driving . It will beep when sw is made . The receive seems to be good and TX is good . You ca nt do much with 3.5 watt output ! ! So much for freedom of choice ! ! Uncle Sam wo n't let me up the power . ;) Everyone is abiding by that rule :)
4 #### I like the extra length and it works as advertised . There are some longer cords on the market for substantially more money . I find this length to price ration to be good .
4 #### Used by connecting to the car battery and wired with 10 AWG to the 7 - pin trailer connector in the back . Used a 30a fuse . Looks water tight .
5 #### Purchased cable to hookup Xbox 360 ( still waiting for delivery ) to router . The price of the Cat5e cable was extremely reasonable especially for 75 ft length and was surprised at the low low price . Highly recommend purchasing ethernet cables from online vendors especially this vendor . After ordering , I received multiple emails on the status of the cable , professionally done . Cable arrived in box well protected . If you purchase this cable from stores like Best Buy , you would probably pay from $ 20 - 30 easily . Price was well below $ 10 plus shipping . I would n't hesitate to purchase cables again from this vendor .
5 #### Love the design and it is very reliable to know that it wo n't move and it will be very tight . I also love how it is cheap .
5 #### I bought this battery thinking it would fit in my 2006 Saturn Vue 3.5L. Unfortunately its too small though it may be so powerful enough to rum the car . I wrote to the seller and he processed for me a refund . I thought that was outstanding
5 #### Buy this . It will cure all your problems . Very high quality part . My refrigerator has been working great since I installed this .
2 #### As the title states , this is a lightly padded duffle bag , nothing more . If you 're toating between practice with an instructor , it 's okay . I purchased it for that reason ... and I 'm an adult , so I can be careful . This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage . I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag . It will prevent my guitar from scuffs , dings , dent & dirt , but that 's it . There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price .
5 #### This item checks to see if the vehicle wiring is connected to a 4 - way female plug correctly .
5 #### I use computers a great deal ( and used to work with them on a professional basis ) and this led to my developing wrist and hand pain from operating keyboard and mouse . Part of the fix for me was to replace my ergonomic mouse with a Logitech Trackman Marble . I LOVE this pointing device ! It is comfortable and " falls readily to hand " as it were , it never gets jerky , jumpy or stuck since it is fully optical , and it is incredibly smooth . My wrist / hand pain went away ! As a bonus , I LOVE playing games with this device . Manipulating your character in games like Quake , Heretic or Ultima IX is so much more natural using the thumb - ball on the trackman than it used to be using a mouse ... It 's easy to feel much more directly connected to the game , to be less conscious of the presence of a pointing device . As a last note , the quality is great . Mine is now three years old and going strong , with no degredation of any sort . If anything , it is better with use -- the ball and the surface on which it rests have become more polished and more silky over time !
5 #### I use a lot of different headsets for music , video , gaming , & of course editing . For some reason I always come back to sony studio monitor headphones . Especially for my editing work , as these headphones are nice and flat when it comes to sound . Even to music I love these cause I always hear what the audio or music really sounds like . If your looking for a good pair of headphones without breaking the bank for editing your video 's then these I highly recommend or for casually listening to music . Reason I say casually is cause they could be more comfortable for long periods of time if you want to listen to music . With that said you really get to hear what your audio really sounds like . These headphone or the more expensive or cheaper one 's are great for their purpose .
5 #### The oil is made for the air cleaner and works if not over saturated . I did a little experimenting and took their process a little further . Spray the oil on lightly but consistently , then use a heat gun to dry it a little . Then it coagulates so as not to drip . I 've done my process twice now with outstanding results .
5 #### With all the electronics people use , this is the perfect surge protector to keep behind the couch or take on trips . Awesome design with colorful plugs ! Kensington is the only surge protector I will purchase . ALWAYS quality product and workmanship . I researched surge protectors on many internet site and 90 % of the time , Kensington products were listed in the top 5 or 10 rated !
5 #### Without a doubt the first purchase for all my vintage cars . Focused , crisp accurate lighting . Nexp purchase is a new windshield .. try it . These two make you forget you drive something antique .
1 #### This product is crap . I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail ( I am a very methodical person ) and it did n't remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more . I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions , but I am not willing to do that ; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work . Following the instructions , it ruins your CD or DVD even further . Do n't wast you time , money and your CD / DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it .
5 #### Perfect for people like my daughter who like to record their favorite shows to watch after work at night . With up to 8 hours on a tape , you can get quite a few shows on one tape ( of course I do n't recommend recording on slow speeds if you want to keep a quality recording . ) A perfect solution for those who do n't want the expense of Tivo or similar devices .
1 #### Very disappointed with this product . As other have noted , the fit inside the lighter is NOT tight at all . So if you 've got a phone with any weight , it spins every time you take a turn . Turn left and it will smack your passenger in the knee . Turn right and it smacks against the steering wheel .
5 #### This is great stuff . I use it on black trim that 's faded . Trim looks new again and it lasts . Not greasy or sticky .
2 #### I bought these for my son because i wanted some headphones to go over his ears like they have at schools , but for a good price . The price is really good for these , but , The sound quality is horrible have to wiggle the cord often , and the packaging all I can say is wow , glad they was not broken .
5 #### A real good case that fits my Nuvi 1450 perfectly . I have n't had it long enough to testify on it 's durability but it certainly looks sturdy . If you buy a 1450 Nuvi I sure recommend this case .
5 #### Armorall leather care is one of the best leather conditioner / cleaner / protectants that I have ever used , although this is more of a protectant and conditioner than a cleaner . I use this product on all my leather products including my leather couch , my leather car seats and leather jackets . If you use this regularly , I tend to use it every change of season , like winter to spring and summer to fall to protect and condition my leather . This product does an excellent job at protecting your leather from the elements and prevents the leather from drying out and cracking which happens over time when exposed to heat and/or sunlight . Highly recommended .
5 #### I 've been playing for a lot of years now . I was an active guitarist when Wes Montgomery , Antonio Carlos Jobim & Eric Clapton were young men . I believe I 've tried every brand of string on the market and these are the best sounding / playing for my electrics . They have a bright sound yet maintain a mellow character . Great for Blues , Rock & Jazz ... on the solid body & archtops . I recommend you try them , at least once .
5 #### The best value for a set of 12 strings . Be aware that Martin 's " extra lights " ( .010 - , 047 ) is the equivalent of some other brands ' lights . Go by the actual gauges when replacing strings , not by the name ( light / extra light / medium ) .
5 #### Arrived timely , appears as advertised , functions as intended , this is a good little unit . I got it to swap out the Realistic that came with an 85 CJ-7 Jeep . I dropped the firestick it came with and ran a new cable to a Wilson flex antenna . I m not a radio guy but I had it peaked and tuned and I am glad I got the unit with the gain control as it does seem to bring that distant signal in just enough to make it out .
1 #### TOOK UP SO MUCH DESK SPACE , I NEVER USED IT . ADD DON"T SHOW REAL SIZE
5 #### Great looking covers ! ! And they are well made . They also have a foam insert to keep the face smooth and flat . I bought these for my Apollo lights but found the fit my Rugged Ridge 11025.10 Black Quick Release mirrors . I use these as mirror covers when the mirrors are off .
5 #### I 've had this case for about a year now and it 's held up very well . There 's also extra room for additional items and the front pocket is great ! I would definitely recommend getting the plastic cover for the controller to protect the buttons and knobs as the walls are n't reinforced and the case allows room for you to install that on the mixer and fit in the case .
5 #### Just right . The right size . Did nt know how how bad my others were until i lost one and had to get a new set . Fit tight
5 #### Good quality at a great price . However , I think It was a closeout .
5 #### these are my go to strings . They sound great , have some life to them and they 're affordable .
5 #### I usually use Dunlop big stubby 2.0 picks . I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today , and I just had to order two more , because they 're so amazing ! ! The attack is second to none ! ! At first the pick felt a bit strange as I 'm accustomed to the thicker Dunlop , and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava ; but in no way has my playing been hindered , if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly , and by far these are the most comfortable picks I 've ever used ! ! What a find ! ! UPDATE 6/6/14 : Still the best pick I 've ever played . If you 're worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings , do n't worry , they wo n't ( at least not from what I 've seen ) . Also , pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks !
5 #### This replacement is for my Lenovo T61 , and it fits perfectly . I 've had it for about 2 months now , and I waited that long before reviewing it because I was skeptical about buying a knock - off brand replacement . But it works perfectly , so definitely save yourself some money and buy this instead of the genuine Lenovo battery !
5 #### Love this charger . Not too bulky to carry around in handbag . Great the have on outings especially for iPhones as they tend to run out of battery power really quickly with constant usage .
5 #### love it . I can protect my phone with class , and carry it easily . when I take it out I still have the thin clean phone without the bulk of a hard case . The phone still fits all of the accessories and docks . this also provides a nice pad for setting my phone down on , instead of sliding around on the desk top .
2 #### Sewn seam was crooked and split when I started installing it . Check it carefully to make sure the seam is centered before putting it on . Edit : The replacement is COMPLETELY different than the defective original . Most visibly , the stitching is hidden . It 's not nearly as tight ( though the box says the same size ) , and half - way through installation was gapping away from the wheel . I wrestled it back somewhat , but then the skip stitching around the spokes gapped . I 'm going to cut it off , re - sew one of the seams ( make it smaller ) and try again . It must be SUPER tight when starting to prevent the end - fold / gapping other people complained about . Temporarily securing it several places around with tiny zip - ties helps too . The thread is n't waxed cord , but common multi - fil polyester , like flat yarn . If you snag it with a needle , it frays .
5 #### I primarily use binoculars for amateur astronomy . And , I am still quite new to the hobby - started in March 2010 . I believe that these binoculars are great for beginners in skygazing . On an exceptionally clear night , and holding still , you can see Jupiter 's moons . You 'll definitely see Pleiades , Orion Nebula , Beehive Cluster , and Venus , to name a few . I have several pairs of binoculars ( including Bushnell 10x50 ) and after reading an astronomy site , I noticed that Nikon 16x50 was mentioned an awful lot . I decided to give them a try , and I did n't really see a difference between the Nikons and Bushnell , so , the Nikons went back in less than 24 hours , and I traded them here at Amazon for the 20x50s . My strong advice to beginners is not to purchase a pair of high end binoculars at first , unless you have a dual purpose for them . Bushnell will pull through for you !
1 #### Phone headset volume would not work . Too much trouble and shipping cost to send it back .
2 #### I got this to replace my current set up of my 12V outlet - based phone mount with my FM Tuner . The idea was to have the two products in one ... which it is . HOWEVER , the arm on this product does not hold its position . I have an LG Optimus 7 ( which is lighter than the iPhone 4 ) and I drive a Mazda Speed6 with the 12V outlet at the base of the dash facing upward at a slight angle . I place the phone in the GOgroove mount , position the arm just right , and it appears to do well . I drive a block away from my house on smooth pavement at a moderate speed ... the arm has straightened out completely and the whole thing has rotated in the 12V outlet coming to rest with the phone at the lowest point possible . Not cool . I messaged the company with the problems , and they replied quickly with some suggestions , which unfortunately did n't help . I tried the handsfree phone and it did n't behave much better than using my phone with my current FM tuner ... I do n't believe the microphone is of any quality , or even there at all . I could hear the person on the phone just fine , but they said I sounded too sharp and " echoey " . The best 12V outlet cell phone mount I 've ever used is the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Kensington - Power - Port - Car - Mount - for - iPhone - and - iPod / dp / B001G7PIDU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Kensington Power Port Car Mount for iPhone and iPod</a > .
3 #### I needed a new charger for my Evo 4g(which i 'm getting rid of soon , but needed a charger ) It works , but for some reason , it takes FOREVER to charge .... left the one(usb ) connected plugged in last nite , woke up , it was still charging ! But it 's ok , it 'll do until I upgrade my phone .
5 #### Worked great for removing the wheel weight adhesive . Some of it was baked on for years . This and a little Purple Power makes quick work of cleaning your wheels .
5 #### Looking for an affordable case for your 5 " GPS with good protection ? This is it ! This case offers perfect fit for Garmin nvi 3590LMT 5 - Inch .
4 #### Nice product ... cd player in car started skipping tracks afet playing 5 - 6 tracks ... ran the cleaner 2x and so far the discs are playing through to completion ...
5 #### Worried that it might be to long to work reliably on our printers - so bought three different brands from Amazon , including this one , that had ratings where reviewers mostly stated that it worked for them . Would not have bought with out those mostly positive reviews . I could have went to a local Office store and paid as much as $ 25 for a similar cable , but that 's not me . But was glad to try 4 of the best rated cables from Amazon for about $ 7.00 each . They all worked fine , including this one . So thanks for the prior reviews from the other users . Perry- Arvada CO
5 #### It was a good purchase . I like the wide banned . It 's comfortable and fit my phone good .
5 #### I got these for my BMW 650I i love them and was a sweet price . must have thank you much
4 #### For the most part - very good cable . Had 1 issue with a kink out of the box that I missed . Cost me about 15 feet of cable because of where the kink was . Otherwise - works great , I 've had no other problems and am running lengths up to 30 feet .
5 #### I am using it on my classical guitar and it works great . It 's easy on the strings and neck , and not losing resilience .
1 #### It is leaving red fibers all over my black interior I will not use it again should I wash it or send it back .
5 #### I 've had three of these on different phones and they are great . You have to be patient and follow instructions to put it on properly , but once they are on your screen is almost bulletproof ... almost . Highly recommended and for the price , if you do n't like it you are n't out much money .
5 #### Did not fit on guitar as well as seen on tv . Still trying to figure it out . A little harder than it seems . Or it was just me .
5 #### So far so good . Seems sturdily built . Time eill tell .
5 #### With a new HP touchscreen computer , I also needed a minimal footprint surge protector - this really answered my need on a modestly sized desk top . Thank you Kensington .
4 #### These lights are great for the money . They 're not " fog lights . " I would consider them more like small high - beams . They 'll shine a few hundred feet on my truck , saying that , they are about 3 ' off the ground on a push bar . Probably wo n't shine as far as well if they 're mounted lower . I still have them hooked up on a switch , but I think I may end up wiring them into my high beams on their own relay . The good : Cheap Easy to hook up Bright Come with covers and rock guards Plenty of wire supplied The bad : My switch burned out and I had to replace it with one that could handle higher throughput The inline fuse holder did n't always make good connection , so I had to install another
5 #### It was nice to find one of these online that was new . I am happy with this as a direct replacement . @doatactical
5 #### Fit perfectly on my head - I 'm 5'1 " , so some headphones are rather loose because the headband is too big . Great noise cancelation without giving me a headache . Great clear sound
4 #### Although the treatment does a good job treating the windows , I have found that removal is not that easy . You have to work at removing the residual haze . I usually have to wait two days to remove the haze entirely .
5 #### It 's a SanDisk , What more can I add to it . I do like the fact that it came in a keeper box with a adaptor , so I can use it in my Note Book Device or My Laptop . It make 's it easier to Transfer Imagery from one device to the other . Especially if I 'm grabbing Images from Google or Bing .
5 #### Folds great , sound is very good ; no need to spend $ 350 on other headphones . These do n't cancel noise but the sound on my iPod is excellent .
5 #### Pricing is so much better than in the stores . Use my P - Touch all the time to stay organized
5 #### Works great , easy to use and keeps my golf clubs from sliding around in the back of my pickup truck .
2 #### This switch is too slow for what I actually need so I wish the fact that such a question might even come up had been made more clear on the page . I get that it 's a knowledge thing on my end but I think if you want consumers to make informed choices so they do n't wind up leaving reviews like this you need to make that more transparent . This switch ca n't accommodate the higher speeds that are available from home providers these days , I am going to wind up getting charged for a service call now ( plus buy a new switch on top of wasting this useless one ) and in my mind it 's reflecting on Netgear . The product page says " Fast Ethernet connectivity " where it should say " adequate " or " suitable for basic setups " or something to that effect indicating I might want to look at the next model . I 'm going to buy a TP - Link on pure principle . This was presented as a home networking solution which means it needs to empower ordinary people with the knowledge they need to make the right choice the first time . This product failed to meet that need .
5 #### Easy to use . Just power up , plug in a spare Ethernet cable and you have extra ports
4 #### I like the product . Good price . I have used it . I would buy this product again . I do n't like having to write such a long comment . I either like it or I do n't and I would buy it again or I wo n't .
5 #### This is probably the perfect iPhone case . The material is quite thin but the phone still sits down softly . The screen is appropriately recessed from the soft edge curled up around it offering protection when its put face down and protecting the edges of the screen protector from curling up . The docking port opening is large enough to let connect to any device , with ample openings for the speakers . The volume and on - off buttons are pressed through elevated built - in tabs which actually makes those functions easier . Importantly , the material itself is somehow both resistant to slipping in your hand but slides in and out of a pocket easily , unlike many protective cases that are so tactile that they do n't want to move anywhere and make you struggle to pull them out of your jeans . This material is a breakthrough . Now if there were a clip that would fit and let me snap it onto my belt , perfection would be upon us .
5 #### The canon 75 to 300 has to be on a tripod at extream zoom or picture blur , other then that top quality photos . Great for nature photos where you can set up for the shot , love it . highly recommended.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Canon - EF-75 - 300mm - f-4 - 5 - 6 - III - Telephoto - Zoom - Lens - for - Canon - SLR - Cameras / dp / B00004THD0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Canon EF 75 - 300 mm f/4 - 5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras</a >
2 #### after arguing with my Gf about it being real or fake we went to the apple store to compare . Its almost the same expect the vibrate and loud switch the gap on this is bigger and wider . No wonder the volume button fell off . but for the price its ok ,
4 #### Have been able to fully recharge my phone ( HTC T - bolt ) at least twice without having to recharge the New Trent , will probably come close or succeed at 3 recharges . I would have preferred that the New Trent recharged itself from the USB connector rather than the round plug on the side but the self coiling connector cable plus mini and micro tips work okay . Also comes with a small pouch to store everything in . About the size of a pack of cigarettes but half as thick or less makes it easy enough to carry around . So far so good . Seems to be a good value . No power supply provided so must recharge from a PC or charger with USB outlet , not a big deal for me and helps hold the cost down .
5 #### looks good have had a chance to use but look 's good , so thank for fast service of the item to me
5 #### I 've been using these reeds for 45 years . They are of consistently good quality .
5 #### Using it to pass this post up . I am using with with cable modem and router , to connect other machines up . Small , and this namebrand backs up their workmanship .
2 #### The picture on the box and the pictures on the Amazon webpage are completely off for the Tan cover . In the pic it looks dark . It is very light in color . The quality seems good so if you are looking for a light tan color , this may be the product for you .
4 #### This appears to be a well made mount for smart phones and will work on most of them . I have n't mounted it on my windshield yet but I sure the suction cup will hold through just about anything . The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that it is a little bulky . No big deal .
5 #### I can plug my bass into a kitchen sink and it will still sound good thanks to this little box . Perfect for going direct into a PA with no amp ( also great for recording direct ) .
5 #### I purchased this cable for my friend and she literally cried . She loves the length . I had no idea that average iphone cable was so short ! ! We love it !
2 #### Just like Morty , I make dirt , and trash . Though there were reviews that said it was to small , I thought I knew better . I wuz wrong . I wish it were three or four times bigger .
5 #### I bought a set of silicone wiper blades about 6 - 7 years ago at walmart , I live in south west FL . I was amazed how long these things lasted and how durable they are . I went back to get another set because the other set started rusting . No one carried the silicone anymore not even the parts stores . I saw these on amazon and I was glade someone was still making blades made of silicon . They work great and are made very well . I know these will last for years .
5 #### The Allsop Ultra ProLens Cleaner worked much better than expected . I highly recommend this product as your first and only choice when it comes to cleaning DVD & CD players .
5 #### The screen protectors I received did not fit my Samsung A877 , the packages read they were for the " SAM A867 " , so beware . I did n't bother returning them , as I have a phone cover that conceals the ill fit . I do like the quality of the protectors , and they have a slight mirror finish to them that is attractive . Update : I left feedback for the company explaining the mistake and they apologized then promptly sent me the correct screen protectors free of charge . They also allowed me to keep the original incorrect protectors as well . Though their initial mistake was inconvienient , they were very courteous and quick to correct the problem . Once I had the correct covers , they fit perfectly and look great .
5 #### Works great ! I was working with a 32 '' TV that I wanted to mount above my fridge . It moves around perfect and lets me do exactly what I wanted . It was hard finding a mount that would let me work in the small area . The arm has a great range of movement allowing me to get the perfect angle and distance for a good kitchen TV .
5 #### Love the thickness of these picks . I have thicker plastic picks for my bass guitar and for some acoustic guitar applications , but for electric guitar these are my ideal .
5 #### I 've had these headphones since nov . 2011 . Before it 's arrival , I 've always settled to using cheap earplugs . It did the job ( i 'm no audiophile ) , but i had been severely pining for over - ear headphones for the longest time then . Now , I absolutely love using it every chance i can get . It 's nearly borderline abusive that i wear them while commuting on foot / car / bus / train . Having these on long flights and lengthy road trips is an excellent escape to an isolated music - listening heaven . A friend recommended buying replacement pads for when the original pads begin to deteriorate , or just replace it all - together with the Beyerdynamic set as it reduces sweating . I 'll probably get to those when my pair wears out then . Without question , I would buy this same set again if the need arises .
5 #### Awesome Beginner all around guitar ! ! I love mine . Learned a good many songs with it and continue to learn more ! Thanks Epiphone for the guitar and the sticker . ( I collect stickers from companys I like ) Will recommend this guitar to anyone I know . Bought me some more strings ( Elixir ) just as a backup in case I break one .
2 #### Was working great for about 2 months before it suddenly stopped giving me sound when plugged in . I had to rotate the cable jack about until I had sound coming out of my amp . I have several Planet Waves patch cables , one custom series cable ( Had it for close to 3 years ) and more recently , the American Stage series . So far none have failed me this badly . My suggestion ? Just get the Custom Series or American Stage cables if you 're gon na buy Planet Waves .
5 #### This cable works great and it 's exactly the same as the original that came with my Aliph Jawbone Prime Bluetooth .
5 #### Must have for your thule set ... kinda a bummer the locks do n't come standard but better to protect your investment than to have them ripped off .
5 #### Muy buen producto y entrega a tiempo , lo recomiendo , calidad y servicio , very good , excelente . .
5 #### There is nothing bad to say about this cable . I bought three at once . They are n't the exact ones shown in the picture , or at least , the ends look different , but they still have the " snagless " design , albeit a slightly different one . Still works just fine as far as functioning as an ethernet cable . I used it with my TrendNet ethernet switch , with no issues yet whatsoever .
4 #### very nice wheel cover , however I would recommend using one of those needle threading tools you get with those small needle and thread kits ( ask your wife or girl friend ) . the thread they give you will not fit in the needle they give you without one . you should also poke the stitching holes open with an ice pick , otherwise it is almost impossible to thread the needle through the holes without a pliers , other than that this is a very nice cover.well worth the price . I have a wheel skins cover in one of my other cars and this one is just as nice for less than half the price . PS . get two or three of those needle threading tools , your going to need them when you make a mistake and have to to re thread the needle .
4 #### This case is sturdy and durable and has protected my phone from several drops . It fits sleekly on my phone and is not sticky and does not collect lint . It slides easily in and out of my pocket and purse . After six months of wear and tear the bottom left corner cracked and and top left corner is pulling away a bit . My husband 's case has been dropped less but is breaking at the same 2 points . However , I am seriously considering getting another of the same case to replace the one that has served me so well for the past 6 months .
5 #### SUPER AWESOME PRICE FOR A WELL MADE CAPO . WORKS GOOD ON MY ACOUSTIC & CLASSICAL GUITARS . THIS CAPO IS NOT FOR THE WEAK HANDED .
5 #### I think the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the BEST bluetooth headset . I 've had three of them ( because I 've lost or broken the other two ) and they are very comfortable to use and work well on both of my phones . Battery life is outstanding . Noise reduction also works well .
5 #### It does what it is supposed to do and does it with style . If you want to save your micro USB port and have a wonderful charging stand for your Blackberry 9700 's bedside mode this product is right for you ! ! !
5 #### more than double what you need to flush the brakes on S1000RR
1 #### no good to me i pecered the can with you kit and it does not fit me car freon line and it just leaked all over i need a new can that will work very very very disopinted
5 #### Really Great Product , soildly built , More than happy with perfomance , and I would ecomend this product to everyone who has a need .... Its all Good !
5 #### If you sing for a living , you deserve a Beta 87 . It captures every nuance , rasp and grain of your voice in live performance , on par with many studio mics costing as much or more . You do n't have to baby it , it 's built like a tank and performs flawlessly in any weather . A built - in electronic bass roll - off circuit lets you set the EQ on your mixer once and forget it . The clarity and quality of your voice remain basically the same . No Bruce Banner when it 's far away , no Incredible Hulk when it 's close , it 's always balanced , warm and clean . To guarantee break - proof operation , Shure offers no switches of any kind on its wired mic line . So you should choose the pattern or circuitry you want by the model . The Beta 87A is supercardioid ( for venues or stages where the monitors are to your side ) The Beta 87C is cardioid ( for club dates , bars or pickup bands , monitors are directly in front of you ) The SM87A has no bass roll - off circuitry , it has a black casing so you know the difference . Not to be obvious , but there 's no reason to use this wonderful microphone unless the rest of your P.A. system or audio interface is of equal quality .
4 #### My fiddle mentor uses this tuner and I liked it . It is a fine tuner to use , though you might have some difficulty getting it to easily fit all violins . It will only adjust out so far . Also the lever on my tuner seems stiff and tough to " slide open " . Nonetheless , all the tuning functions are great and it is a real treat to be able to tune your instrument no matter what noise and clatter , or even other instruments being tuned are present -- the tuner " hears " only the string you are striking .
2 #### Wanted more magnification so we went with a 10x unit . Left ocular would not focus on arrival without wearing glasses , which was difficult given the poor eye relief . Expected Steiner quality as we already have two 7x30 that are excellent with or without glasses . Returning and probably going with Fujion in the 10x50 .
5 #### This is the real deal , not a knock off . I love this detachable lanyard ; i have been using the Reiko lanyard for years , never had a problem . I use it ALL the time , for my iphone . I bought this color to go with my new case and hoped that this was an authentic Reiko . It is ! Very well made , and very safe .
4 #### Had a very heavily oxidized boat to detail and was debating on what to use . I am a Meguiars guy and after watching several video tutorials and reading reviews determined this would be necessary . I read someone stating that it left their boat a yellow color and thought the same thing until I found out the actual color of the boat was an off yellow color and this made the boat look new . The boat had sat for about 4 years with no upkeep and was subjected to Maryland weather . I was surprised how quickly the chalk was eliminated with this stuff and a wool pad on my polisher . A bit hard to wipe off if it sits , to long but just have to be ready to wipe as soon as buffer stops . This boat was so bad I had to shorten the amount of area I was working so I did n't have to scrub so hard to get the compound off and eliminated having the dry spot look . It brought the boat back and made it shine like they had just bought it . GREAT STUFF ! ! !
5 #### I was having a lot of trouble finding a decent gig bag that would fit a 12 " open back banjo . This bag 's not absolutely perfect , but especially with a padded strap like this one:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Neotech-8223562 - Slimline - Strap - Banjo - Regular - Brown - Leather / dp / B0043WF916 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Neotech 8223562 Slimline Strap , Banjo , Regular , Brown Leather</a > it fits really well . ( Not sure how that link will get formatted . ) Like others have noted , the front pockets are kind of awkward . They 'll fit books if you 're ok with the books popping out the top . Overall though , great bag . Enough padding for putting in a car , trunk , throwing on your back and biking around town .
5 #### I 've been using K & N air filters on all my race cars , muscle cars , pickups etc , great products , I instantly noticed the improved performance on my 2004 chevy , which has aftermarket flowmaster exhaust ,
4 #### Let me preface this by saying that I really did n't WANT a bug deflector for my 2002 1500 Silverado as I think they look better without , but i had a few chips in my paint occur at work , not to mention a small rust spot above a headlight . So I wanted to cover these up instead of paying hefty money to paint them . All in all I 'm very satisfied with it . It covers up these blemishes and it honestly does n't look too bad . I have black housing in my headlights and I was afraid this would be overkill , but I think it looks good . Much better than the chips and rust spot ! However , the holes did n't line up perfectly for me . I had to force the screws in on two of the holes , which made me nervous as I did n't want to crack the shield .
5 #### I like these a lot . I like the feel better than round wound . I wanted to try some Jamerson strings , and if I remember right these were half the price of the Labellas .
5 #### Both the keychain itself and the ring are of high quality thick metal and look like there 's no weaknesses in the design that should cause a break in the future . Very happy .
5 #### Great budget guitar strap . I particularly like the thicker edges .
1 #### Garbage product . Cups are hard rubber , deformed by packaging and do n't maintain suction even after a lick and stick . Or wax . Anything tried . I got two twists per suction out of these before they let go . Nothing like old sets .
1 #### well the question of is this an ok lens yes and no . i did 3 events where i needed long focal length and this thing crapped out on me at 300mm/ no flash/ iso 6400/ at f5.6 - 1/150 which gives super blurry pics ... and do n't think of moving the shutter speed this thing looses so much light . but ok i tried it outside in sunny conditions , well it was super dark as well shooting RAW , adjusting exposure in post shows to much grain for an outdoor picture ... in all i was not pleased with this lens and opted for the 70 - 200 mm f2.8 yes it is worth the 2k price but you get what you pay for ... when it comes to a lens on't be cheap or you wo n't be happy ....
4 #### From Pearl . It works with no complaints . Not much more to say about this one ! No issues with it at all .
5 #### Rain will bead even on this 25 year old top . Nice
5 #### Granted a wireless switch is not the most complex of all product purchases , I was more than happy with the setup . Unwrap , plug - in to your existing network and you 're in business .
5 #### I have used this for the past several weeks and so far love it . I charge it over the weekend and keep it on all week . My phone automatically syncs to the unit and allows quick hands free calling . The sound is loud and clear on both ends of the call . This is a great cost effective way to add a Bluetooth speakerphone to any vehicle .
5 #### Everything I needed to make a nice connection for my horse trailer
5 #### I have used this mouse ( model ) for about 4 or 5 years . Absolutely love it always dependable . When on Ubuntu , the task bar even shows the amount of battery power left in the one double - a. Whether wired or wireless ( I have had both ) , this is so comfortable . You only move your thumb to use it . For me , trackball is the way to go - you can just sit it on the arm of your couch or on your stomach when using a laptop . However , it takes a little patience to get used to this type of mouse . I recommended it to someone at work and he did n't like it . So he gave the mouse to me ( bonus - extra one for me ! )
5 #### Straight up an easy clean . The gauze unit was naturally dried OUT OF DIRECT SUN before vehicle re - entry . The recharge unit shall last a long time within this shop .
3 #### Nothing special . Just like every other strap of its kind . I compared it to other poly straps I have and it 's OK . No better and no worse . Price was good . It took a long time to come . Leather ends seem OK . I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint .. I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK . I 'm a little disappointed . I 'm used to a higher quality from EB products . It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone . I do n't perform a lot of antics on stage , it 's just me and the axe . I do n't expect any problems . Hope this helps . Small " thumbs up " to Amazon .
5 #### My SanDisk m230 512 mb mp3 player has an equalizer feature . With it these buds sound great , with plenty of bass . They come with a solid carrying case . Very happy with this purchase .
4 #### Been using for gigs on my midi foot controller and it 's been reliable .
4 #### These items looked to be of good quality and have lasted several months so far . I am satisfied with the purchase , considering the low cost .
5 #### Hi i got the package today . It looks really good and it was on nice packaging so its all good . And its really cute and shiny ! ! ! ! Bling bling ! ! ! !
5 #### Ultimate guitar tool . combines peg winder & string cutter in a well made one piece tool . Every guitarist should have this tool in his /her gig bag or guitar case . No guitarist should be without one !
5 #### If you need more than 21 ' of instrument cable from your axe to your amp , you 'd have to go wireless . This cable is so clean and conducts the signal so precisely I would have no other , ever . A must have .
1 #### I thought it was good enough for Christmas gift , but our son got his dad a larger one , & there was no comparison . Went with the one our son bought , the one I got is not being used wo
5 #### Best deal in town . The stylus are great , light n so inexpensive . I have bought these for friends n family . It takes a while to get here but the price makes it worthwhile .
2 #### I guess you get what you paid for in this instance . These are really bad . First of all , they really do n't fit over your ears correctly no matter how may ways you try to make it work . The length of the plug in wire is perfect for me as most headphones have short leads . And although I was n't worried about the quality of the sound because I was n't going to use them for listening enjoyment , the quality is pretty bad .
5 #### My wife recently upgraded to an iPhone 5C and we 've tried a number of different cases , but this by far is her favorite so far . First off , she liked the topaz color , which was sufficiently " girly " for her . She also likes that it is form fitting on the iPhone and does n't significantly increase the size or weight of the phone . After over a month of daily use , the phone is in good shape and the Belikin Shield Sheer Matte Case is doing of good job of protecting it . All in all , a good case at a decent price . my rating is 5 stars .
5 #### I like APC products and really appreciate how the continue to support their product . While not cheap I like original equipment and this battery is that . I get years of service as I did on the last battery I 'm sure .
4 #### These mud flaps are very nice , not a thing wrong other than they did not fit my husband 2006 Toyota Tundra - I took a guess , and was wrong . I did not ask for a return as it was my error in ordering - I am hoping I can give away as a gift to someone that can use them .
5 #### Very nice kit for easy change out of ball sizes . When you have numerous trailers this makes it easy tow different things without a fuss .
5 #### I had purchased this before and they wore out after heavy use , arrived on time , great product , takes a little time to stretch with iPhone cover but it works well for me .
5 #### A guitar player can never have enough of these things around . These picks hold up well & that says alot because I am not easy on picks if any kind .
5 #### What can I say ? I played these for years ... they work well with non traditional tuning and seldom break . Last long . Everything you want from a guitar string
5 #### These are the batteries that one of my watches takes . They work well and seem to last a long time . I just wish all of my watches used the same battery .
5 #### I love this microphone . I could go on for a long time about its features and reputation , but I 'd rather speak about its usability . Firstly , it is a highly directional mic - do n't expect to pick up much from the sides or back of it , making it a great , focused instrument mic . I also attached a windscreen on it ( also purchased from Amazon ) and I 've found that this mic is surprisingly capable as a vocal mic , too . Do n't be afraid to put this mic in front of very loud sound sources , like amps or snare drums . It 'll handle just about anything you throw at it . If you 're like me and have your own home studio , the SM 57 is absolutely essential . I do n't have too many mics , but the 57 has taken over about 95 % of my recording tasks , even replacing my condenser mic for vocals . I could not be happier with this mic .
5 #### Todo muy bien . Me gusto ... Fue lo que pedi ... llego a tiempo ... Excelente , recomendando 100 % ... Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela ...
1 #### battery goes from charged to dead at the drop of a hat . background switches when it ever it wants . keyboard switched to spanish one day . the touch dial sucks too many irratations there to mention . makes calls when the phone is in my pocket even when supposedly locked I am stuck with this POS until feb 2011
4 #### Not as powerful as I 'd prefer but WAY better than those crappy clip - on or clamp holders . You 'll never go back .
5 #### Harness was a perfect fit for my 97 grand cherokee . Just got a new radio I connected all the matching wires together and plugged it in , and the radio fired right up , no problems at all .
5 #### These short mallets are great for small hands , easier to hit the notes . Wood has a much better tone than hard plastic .
5 #### This is one beautiful quality lens . Gives a gorgeous bokeh effect for portrait photography . If I had to do it all over again I think I would have purchased the 85 mm 2.8 macro for portraits instead . The 100 gives me a bit of distance from the subject and I would prefer to be closer . I have used it for macro and it is AWESOME for that purpose . That being said , just because you buy a macro lens does not mean you will have great pics . This lens even at f22 will not give you the depth of field sharpness for macro you may desire . The only true way to achieve that is to do what s called focus stacking . This lens will give you the right first step if you are looking to get in to macro work .
5 #### These are the best sounding strings that I have used on my flattop . The sound is full and balanced and the longevity of the strings is outstanding . This product performs as advertised !
2 #### Hooked it up to my gsxr 750 hoping it would be louder than the stock horn , no such luck it sounded awful and was n't half as loud as the stock horn . Not sure why i tried it with the bike running and not running , oh well i m sure i can find anothee use for it .
5 #### I love nooks . Kindle fire is OK , but nooks are easy to root and install cyanogen mod foe a full android experience .
3 #### It broke after a few months of use . It was great up until that point .
5 #### Hands down , I think they are the best headphones for the money . I use them at work to listen to mp3 music and love them . Highly recommended .
5 #### Got this yesterday and was immediately impressed with it 's weight and construction . The wheels are n't chintzy . The zippers down the middle seem rugged and well - made . There 's three additional outer , zippered pockets for various " stuff " . There 's also a hidden , inner zippered compartment on the end with the wheels . Good place to stash and keep the shoulder strap which I ca n't see using much when this sucker is loaded with all my hardware . There 's a handle in the middle ( two handles that velcro together , nicely padded ) and three other single handles on the ends ( two at one end , one on the end with the wheels) ... all of which will make it easy to manhandle up stairs , into vehicles , etc . Actually looking forward to packing all my gear in this thing and making a single trip for a change !
5 #### Guitar arrived promptly in great shape . Great value for the price . FH
5 #### I 've used a nook simple touch for a long time now , at least a year , and I 've always loved it but hated that I had to have a light on to read at night ( this is n't the stone age , we have the technology ) so I got myself the simple touch with glowlight for christmas and I LOVE it highly recommend it to any avid readers out there ! screen resolution is wonderful , as is the battery life
3 #### Small thin bucket and the handle will keep coming apart from the bucket .
5 #### It is not only cleaning it is entertaining too , with all that pretty image that you see during the process .
5 #### i bought this for my husbands work lunch box just in case his phone dies . a few days ago it charged up his phone and also charged up a camera i had troubles charging . i do love New Trent this is my 3rd charger from them and i still carry the first one in my purse . the second one is for my iPad . this product holds it 's charge so when you need it , it 's still there and really is n't that what an external charger is supposed to do ?
5 #### Nice size , reasonable quality and good accessories . Just what I needed as a spare radio , or ship to shore radio . Small with good features
5 #### I bought this case for my Garmin eTrex and am glad I did . The case fits perfectly , allows full use of the buttons , and looks good too . Another feature I like is the sturdy clip that secures my eTrex to my belt when hunting .
5 #### This mount costs a little bit more and looks a bit better than some others , but the cheaper ones also get the job done .
1 #### Arrived in a huge box , very little packing materail with a crack all the way up one side of the bucket . In addition , this bucket has an odd shape . Not very deep , and it flares out on the top . Quality of the plastic is not all that either . You can buy a really nice bucket at the local home improvement store reasonably priced .
4 #### So the product listing says " Packaged in Sealed Verizon retail package " and this was absolutely not the case for the one I received . It came with its 3 parts in a small zip - lock bag . On the plus side , the case seems to be of reasonable quality , the droid fits perfectly in it , the clip does swivel and is nice and tight . We 'll see how well it lasts , but I can guy 3 for the same price as the VZ store , so what 's the harm - so far so good .
3 #### The instructions were more complicated than other products out there and required using water on the screen of the phone . Unfortunately after I purchased it other people who have had used this type of product told me that it never lasts as long as they said and can damage the screen when you take it off . Rather than risk it I purchased a three pack of the kind that does not use adhesive . This item may be great but I will never know since I did not use it .
5 #### I 've been a radio buff for years , AM / FM / Shortwave , have tried receivers from bargain - basement level to the $ 1000 + digital jobs , and ca n't tell you the number of times I 've responded to another radio by thinking " pretty good AM receiver , but not quite up to the old Superadio III " If you want the best AM reception possible and demand the convenience of digital tuning , get a CCRadio for about $ 150-$165 . If you listen in an area that gets poor reception , like a basement , you may need a more expensive receiver that can accept an external antenna . But if all you want is the best AM reception and great FM sound at a reasonable price , the matter is simple and clear - get a Superadio III . And by all means run it on batteries - the D cells give the unit a wonderful heft that keeps it stable and even seems to improve the sound somewhat , and are remarkably long - lasting . Hope that helps .
5 #### I 'm not sure you can " love " a product but I AM totally satisfied with the price , quality and timeliness of shipment .
4 #### This radios work great and make an ideal back up to full power radio . It works as backup and something to carry around the boat .
4 #### This product came in a very small grey bottle . When opened it came out as semi - liquid . I followed the instructions on autogeek.net for how to apply this and it worked like a charm . First coat of the Klass All In One , then layered two coats of this product . Be very careful when dispense it onto your applicator . It 's VERY concentrated and a little goes a long way . If you get carried away , or accidentally use too much you will regret your aching arms later as it 's hard to get off and polish to a nice shine without it being streaky . Also be forewarned , do n't set this bottle on top of your car or on anything other than a porous , level surface . I learned the hard way that once it 's applied and buffed off the roof of your car , the bottle will slide on the sealed surface and eventually tip over . This stuff will make your paint slick , soft as silk , and give it a deep wet - looking shine . Better than most waxes I 've used even . The bottle looks a bit deceiving , it 's well designed but much smaller than I thought it would be . Overall an excellent product . Hard to buff off , and do n't use too much .
5 #### This tape is very dependable and durable . It 's sticking ability is beyond my expectations . This is excellent tape for all types and conditions of marking .
3 #### Replaced two shorter cat3 cables using union with this cable , simpler connection but no improvement in performance . Was hoping for better , but meets the need .
4 #### I got one of these before and they are really good . I was going to get one at Staples but it was $ 32 . I paid $ 10 less for the same product , that is a good deal to me .
3 #### This manual is a complex tear down of your vehicle . Nice when you need specifics . Excellent when R&R is needed . Does n't provide for the layperson , that wants to know the simpler things .
5 #### Although this is a great capo , the clamp is a bit stiff which will pitch up your guitar quite a bit . I modified mine a bit to make it loose .
4 #### The texture of this is very rubbery but feels nice to the touch . The texture helps you grip the device . Does n't provide much protection but for around the house use , was more than adequate . Would buy again for a slim case the provides some protection .
4 #### Having recently discovered 3 M automotive products I will most likely never use anything else and it holds true with this product . I recently bought a used Jeep that had several scratches across the hood . After an hour or two and the assistance of other 3 M products the hood looked like glass . Great product .
3 #### Wire gauge of small gauge . Wiring best suited for only LEDs
2 #### It does n't have AM as it says . Very poor quality sound and a lot of distortion . the Shorwave doesn;t work properly . Dotot buy it .
1 #### After talking to their tech from India it was determinded to be defective and I was told to return it to Amazon.com for a refund , But instead I am going to send it to Linksys in peices very little peices maybe they can recycle it ... Tin cans and a string would work better .
5 #### I bought this phone case for my boyfriend . When I received it I was totally impressed , it is has a very good quality material . It fits perfectly to the phone . It shipped very quickly , I 'm a happy customer !
4 #### I received this item in 3business day ! I installed it myself and it work ! The only downside of this product is the screwdrivers that came with it are not magnetic and it took me forever to remove the screws and put them back bc they are so tiny . This is why I give it 4stars . I would highly recommend this product .
5 #### I 've owned a lot of gadgets / devices and tried many many cases , sleeves and covers but diztronic cases are the best bang for the buck . Solid , durable , good quality , sleek , pleasing to the eye and very competitive price . Some people are okay with spending 30 - 50 dollars on a case .... I'm not . You will not be disappointed with a diztronic case . Back has a nice grip , does n't get dirty , leave finger prints , smudges or oil stains . Nice and tight , great fit and wo n't break the bank . The front has a nice lip to it so the lcd glass is protected from scratches when placed face down on a flat surface . Cut outs are big enough to accommodate most if not all plugs for micro usb or headphones . Buttons are easily accessible . Better than any other case at any other price point .
5 #### these are the best for doing scales and arpeggios and generally fast riffs and they glide off the strings , i gave a bunch of old picks to a friend of mine and after i realized these were in the bag(had about 4 of em ) but i can get more and looked them up here and went for it
3 #### I 've tried a half dozen BT headsets over the years , this one does indeed blow them all out of the water for outgoing audio , incoming is average , nothing to write home about , so sound gets 5 stars . Fit , or lack thereof , is around 1 star . AFAIK my ears are pretty average , not too many children laugh or point , and all other headsets have found a way to stay in there , but not the jawbone . And whoever designed the ear buds to change out with a 90 degree turn identical to the 90 degree turn you use to put the headset in your ear , well , not the best system guys , I had to use superglue to make it useable . So averages out to 3 stars , and I am looking for another headset .
5 #### Bought this kit for my 99 Jeep Grand Cherokee . Fits like a glove . Easy install and best of all , no gaps ! One note : this kit does not come with screws that attach the side fins to the head unit .
5 #### This kit worked perfect to cover the cord to a baby monitor . Sticks to the wall without a problem .
3 #### Not sure what else you can say . They are just basic plastic guitar picks . Nothing fancy , no complex moving parts , just a piece of thing plastic shaped in such a way as to make strumming or picking a guitar or even a bass easy ...
5 #### This fuel pressure regulator is the best for use with carburetors . But then , it is made by Holley . It 's a natural combination .
5 #### Great to have a long cord since computer set up is far from outlet by necessity
5 #### I have used this product in the past and I have to say what a perfect product when in the process of detailing any vehicle . It removed so much built up tree sap and over - spray and just made life so much easier when I was detailing the cars in my family . Thank you and OUTSTANDING Meguiar 's
5 #### I got this for distributing sound to my home audio speakers . Works like a charm and have n't had an issues .
3 #### This was easy to install and fit my Mazda CX-5 . I think I received a size C. I put it on but it looked a little cheap and mostly just weird . My sister describes it as looking like intestines . I decided to find one that I can sew on on eBay .
4 #### I changed the oil in my sailboat and it was easy and clean I really like this extractor I recommend it to any one
5 #### Got these for my 2005 escape and really like them . I like the ones that go on the outside .. very easy to install .. Got a pair that mounted in the window channel for my wife 's escape they are a pain .. to close to the window .. hard to wash under them .
1 #### this is the second one of these that does n't work will not stay attached to valve stem.first one bought from auto parts store.my compressor maintains 170 psi- that could have something to do with the failures , but there are no warnings of how much pressure they will handle .
5 #### great protection for iphone . i love the white on white color scheme . a lot of reviewers think it 's bulky , but that is the style of otterbox . that 's why it offers such great protection
5 #### Worked great , only used basic features but sent and recieved just fine while on the trail .
5 #### In my opinion this is the best solution for so many mounting issues for all phones
5 #### I have had this a few days and I love it ! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus ! I have never had a nook before so I 'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power / sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press . Other than that , I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I 'm on winter break from school !
5 #### Had this on my car for a little over a year now and I 'm very satisfied with it . It 's held up in the elements and done its job very nicely
5 #### I use these at work when I 'm busy and need to concentrate . I work in a cubicle with people who like to laugh and joke LOUDLY . That 's great , except when I have a deadline . I put these on and listen to a CD or the radio , and it shuts out the noise to the point where I can actually get some work done . I think the sound quality is great . The coiled cord is about 5 feet long or so and stretches out nicely . Sony 's page says the cord is 9.8 feet long , extended . It allows me to move about a small area in my cubicle without it getting tangled . They are the only headphones I 've been able to wear all day long without hurting my head . I 'd buy them again , especially at this price .
5 #### I 've got quite a few of these and they always work !
4 #### I typed in my brother machine model , this came up . I failed to read it was not for my machine . I have a great results with their labels before so I am sure this will be just as fabulous . They adhere well to many surfaces .
4 #### EXCELENTE PRODUCTO ... NO TENGO NINGUNA QUEJA ... COMO RECOMENDACI&Oacute;N NUNCA COMPREN A " WORLD OF SPORT " EXCELENTE PRODUCTO ... NO TENGO NINGUNA QUEJA ... COMO RECOMENDACI&Oacute;N NUNCA COMPREN A " WORLD OF SPORT "
5 #### I did a lot of researching before purchasing this and I am very pleased . Music just sounds better and I was very much surprised . I 'm not an audiophile , I am a regular consumer . I 've used $ 200 + earbuds and they do n't compare imo to what you can get through headphones . The only negative I can think of is that the padding can get warm if worn for a long time . I bought a replacement earpads ( non Sony ) and now it 's perfect . I use to study because it can be noisy outside of my room . I would buy this if you 're getting your feet wet and want the best for sub $ 100 headphones . I would n't buy this if you care what this might do to your hair .
3 #### I had a problem with it staying connected to my Iphone , but when it was connected it worked great . After around 20 - 30 minutes it would lose its connection with my phone for no apparent reason . I had my phone checked out and Apple assured me there was nothing wrong with my phone , and Parrot customer support insisted it was a problem with my phone . I am not sure what to believe as my wifes Iphone stays connected with no problems . I give it 3 starts because when it works , it works great , and my wife uses hers with no problems , but i have purchased another unit ( Motorola T325 ) that works just as good and stays connected to my iphone .
5 #### worked great for keeping in the car and drying off really quickly after a run through the car wash .
5 #### Was super protective and it was a little snug , so taking it off took time , but it was lovely . I 'd recommend this to anyone who wants a clear case . On the down side , after a while it does get scratched up easily , but for the price , it 's amazing .
5 #### I really like the Ultex medium picks for acoustic guitar . They have better flexibility and texture than your standard cheap picks ( which are like credit card material ) .
4 #### Excellent Screen protector . When placed on the phone it looked awesome with the Mirror look like . But it did n't stay for more than a week . Now it looks like just a regular Screen protector , and the Mirror quality is not same as it was on Day 1 . But still a good product for the Price I paid .
5 #### I tested this product on the face of my Sony Walkman with a foam applicator and it took out most of the scratches and scuff marks without much effort . I then used it to remove the swirl marks in my black window rain / wind deflectors and within a minute or so of medium hand buffing they looked much better . So for the price it works very well .
5 #### Wow , what 's great case . If you want a great minimalist case , this is it ! I usually HATE iPhone cases , and go naked , but this is such a great fit .
5 #### Cable is perfect for connecting my korg triton le to my profire 2626 . Nice and lengthy to reach across my space .
5 #### Ca n't complain about this card , it does the job , no troubles at all ; just plug it in and you are good to go .
5 #### It does fit my 1993 Ford Crown Victoria for the passenger side only
5 #### Amazon basic cables are my go to cable now . inexpensive but still a quality product . no much memory to the cable and the connectors are solid i could n't ask for mor
1 #### Okay , maybe it 's not fair of me to review the Qwik Time metronome because I got it free when I purchased a saxaphone ( I did n't actually purchase the metronome ) . The knob on mine wo n't turn to any setting other than 100bpm . Other than that it seems okay . It produces a tone at A440 , clicks off 100 bpm or blinks a light at 100 bpm . Does seem strange , since it 's sold as a metronome , that no other tempo can be selected . Short of that it works . So , since I did n't have anything invested , I took it completely apart . Battery out , circuit board out , arrow display decal glued to the center of the knob and sure enough , it is one molded piece with no ability to turn , EVER ! I even took to it with a pair of pliers to be sure . It 's just a pretty picture that gives you the impression of select - ability . I 'd be skeptical of any of their products now . So I stand corrected . It is n't a knob . The arrows are buttons which you push to go up or down in tempo . Sorry
5 #### Great for projecting UTubes from computer to flat screen tv
1 #### I had an older Pentium II 400 running Windows 98 when I bought this item . It worked great and I would have rated it 5 stars . However , I recently purchased a new top - of - the - line Pentium 4 from Dell ( awesome by the way ) , which was of course loaded with Windows XP . I have since wasted countless hours trying to get this drive to work under XP . My system will simply not recognize the drivers -- even the newest XP driver downloaded from Viking 's website . All of my other hardware peripherals connected beautifully under XP . After spending time on the phone with Viking support , I was more frustrated than ever . There are much better ( and cheaper ) alternatives at your local Best Buy or Circuit City . I bought a SimpleTech CF reader for $ [ money ] at Circuit City that works beautifully with XP . Go in another direction !
5 #### These are simply the best headphones that you can purchase for an under $ 100 price tag , and they are under 50 $ ! Very full , clear , sound with an amazing amount of bass . The styling is n't the greatest in my opinion , but the amazing sound quality more than makes up for it .
5 #### Unlike headphones intended for listening to mixed music , which often over emphasize low end response , these headphones provide a well balanced response for mixing music accurately .
3 #### These trailer plug caps work alright , but they are both identical . One fits well on the car side where there 's only one exposed plug , but the other only fits loosely on the trailer side where there 's 3 exposed plugs because it 's not formed to match that side . These 2 - packs of weatherproof plug covers should be molded so one fits the car side and one fits the trailer side .
5 #### These were bought for my two sons who are using these in school for music . I had to use them in school and remember using used recorders , and did not want my kids going through the same embarrassment . Very nice product and quickly delivered .
4 #### works fine just have to remember to tighten after 1st 5 miles from house . Get some advise on how best to use . thanks
5 #### I bought this for an older Galaxy Ace GT - S5830 phone , however it 's worked with several other phones including my blackberry 9850 . Very comfortable and easy to put on .
5 #### Months ago I saw a " charging station " in the SkyMall catalog and thought I should build one of those . It was a nice wooden box in which to hide your chargers and cords . While designing my charging station I thought about using one transformer and splicing the adaptors in . Then the old " build or buy " adage hit me and I did an internet search for multi station charger and found Callpod . I now have it and have nearly finished my charging station . The Callpod is perfect for this application . I reduced much of the clutter in my charging station and can charge many devices . I agree with some of the other reviews that it is n't easy to get all the correct adaptors , so expect to spend another $ 20-$40 getting all the adaptors you need . It would be nice if they indexed more camera adaptors , since many of them are the same as the phone adaptors . Its just that without an index you can never be sure .
3 #### I ca n't simply understand nature of such negative feedbacks . Do n't like sound quality / durability / usability / etc ? - Check price tag , scratch your head , try to find same durability / usability / etc for same price , I bet you ca n't . So this headphones perform amazingly well , compared to their $ 12 price tag . So do n't expect $ 100 quality from these . If you still wonder what quality of sound these have , here 's comparison with other KOSS products . This ( The Plug ) , sounds worse than Koss Porta Pro , but sounds better than Koss UR10 ( but you need heavy EQ usage to actually set these " plugs " to be better then UR10 ) . Hope this helps .
3 #### Ordered two of these , one is still working and the other worked for about a day .. now just lights up but wo n't charge .
1 #### this is the cover that i usually use on my car to at least try to protect it from the elements . the first one last me about one year . it really takes a punishment too . for the price it is good enough for me . update : it barely lasts two months in the sun . i do n't think this is for outside use . it just totally disintegrated on the top . i am not too happy about it either .
5 #### Item arrived as advertised on time and I am pleased with the purchase .
5 #### Large 6 " dia each , & heavy , requires 20amp relay , fuse or better and probably mounts . In modern cars they can be very difficult to mount but are better than air horns .
4 #### i loved mirror screen protectors but got very tired after some weeks after not being able to actually SEE
5 #### These pickups produce a great sound . Ca n't beat them for the price .
5 #### You ca n't beat these headphones for the price . I 'm no audiophile or anything but I can tell you the bass and general sound quality is several notches above what I expected . I did n't buy them for music but I have decided they are acceptable for this purpose too . They fit very comfortably and and stay on my head well too . I would buy another one in a heartbeat .
3 #### Camera is a bit bigger than most disposables because of the plastic outercase . Avoid any lotion getting on the lens area because it will become foggy instantly . Pictures are grainy for sure , but ok if there is enough light on the underwater reef and fish . Colors are more bright than Kodak camera .
1 #### it said it would fit but it didn't.sent it back . do n't know if i got credit yet
3 #### I was n't really happy with these . They sound and play decent , but since going to Elixer PB I am not going back . PS : They are a lot cheaper than the Elixers but do n't last near as long .
5 #### I used them on my American Standard Tele and they sound great , I do n't have a lot of playing time on them yet maybe 6 or 7 hours . but they seem very bright
1 #### I 've have two of these and trust me its not about IF the cap will leak but WHEN . The cap is made from plastic that gets brittle when it comes in contact with oil ! ! Why Rhino will not change this easy to fix solution is beyond me . Even the large main cap on the top does not close securely enough to carry the container on its side without oil leaking out . Do NOT buy this .
4 #### This case fits my Voyager Pro perfectly an makes it easy to carry when traveling . I like the belt tab but wish it had a bit of a hook on the bottom so that it would n't fall off my belt so easily .
5 #### very nice binoculars . Good all round use . Easy to focus .
4 #### I used it for hiding speaker cable , remember that the width only support 2 speaker cables ( I m using for bose speakers ) and hard fit for 3 cables , for 3 I rather go with " Wiremold C210 White Cordmate II Kit " which is same concept but better width For 2 cables this is much better and quality is great
5 #### Great little switch panel . I have not had any issues as some other reviewers . ( good ) Got it for a single purpose , has not had heavy use . A venue has some spotlights whose only control is plugging them in ( one plug ) , so we use this as a light switch by plugging the spots into this instead of the wall .
3 #### I 'd think this could be shorter / smaller it is about three quarters to an inch long and works well .
5 #### Great replacement for a rearview mirror . Big for a large car perfect size . I do n't know how night mode works or whatever but for sure its just a normal rearview mirrors
4 #### Tool looks to be good value but I have yet to use it
5 #### I absolutely love the nanoweb strings . The are a quality product , have great tone and simply play extremely well on my flattop .
5 #### We ordered these to put in an area of our church that gets regular use , and needs a PA system that is easily turned on / off by novice users . We also wanted great sound quality . The switch is nice , as it allows our users to just use the on / off switch on the mic to turn it on and off , rather than having to mess with the sound board . Sound quality is every bit as good as the SM58s that we also have . Great mics for the money ... may buy a couple more ! Plus , they 're well built , and tough , just like a Shure should be .
4 #### I have been running my Netgear switch for about six years with no problems . The FS108 is an 8 port gigabit switch , sot all it does is pass signals on to the other devices . A router will actively direct the signals to the devices just to be clear on what you are getting here . This is not a powered port switch like it says in the listing . You need the 108P series . Look for the P This unit runs hot . I got my laser thermometer out and it read that it was running at 104 degrees all the time . There is no cooling fan inside . Right now I have the switch just sitting on a shelf . I have had it mounted at one time on the wall with no problems . To wall mount you screw in screws the proper length apart with the heads sticking out from the wall , then slide the switch back onto them . Enclosure is nice heavy duty metal . No cheap plastic case here . Speeds are truly gigabit . I transfer large files and video on network at high speed .
5 #### These headphones do n't have the best fidelity on the market , but they are pretty good . I have a Yamaha electric piano and I use them for practice . I 'm a professional musician and have used this model extensively in the studio , where they are standard equipment , and I find the sound just right for my usage . If you 're looking for headphones with greater fidelity solely for listening to music , you might not find these headphones ideal . They do not have noise canceling and they 're not compact which makes traveling with them awkward . On the other hand , the fidelity is excellent for my use and they are extremely comfortable to wear for an extended session . I 'd buy these again in a heartbeat , so if you 're looking for a good set of utility headphones with true sound fidelity , these are the ones to consider . They 're a music industry staple and you wo n't regret your purchase .
5 #### This tremelo pedal works nicely and it 's great when you 're playing through an amp without tremelo . Problem solved ! The price was also very good .
4 #### To be honest , I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth 's first album KIMB . So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet , but i ve got close enough to it . This pedal is great , only a couple notes I should make about it . Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock , or just rock in general . This pedal is for metal . The battery drains like a MF . I do n't understand why . The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp , but i ve had other pedals that would nt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON . I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries . Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal .
5 #### This is an excellent case as far as I 'm concerned ! It looked great on the impression , attaches very securely onto the phone encapsulating it with excellent openings for access to buttons , ports , camera and speaker as well as covering the two haves as it is a slider phone . Before purchase I read several reviewers that were not happy with this style or saying it was n't made very well in their opinion , but I think it works and looks great . The case also provides a great grip to the very slippery basic phone so it is more difficult to be dropped while getting it out of a pocket or just talking on the phone . I highly recommend it , especially at the Amazon price ! ! An almost IDENTICAL case was just under $ 20.00 at a local phone store . My Samsung Impression recently went to our daughter as I upgraded to a Samsung Captivate . I also got the same kind of case for that phone too as I liked it so much . This type of snap on rubberized case , not this model case . And it looks and works great for that phone too !
5 #### Keeps a fresh scent while disolving the poop . What more could you ask for ? ! ? !
5 #### When I began updating the maps I was confronted with " no memory " . I did n't realize my Garmin had a place for a SD card ! duhI ordered this one because Kingston is a quality company and the price was right . Perfect . I 'm all caught up on my GPS updates and assume this 4 GB card will last the life of the GPS and not fill up .
1 #### After five months of light home use mine quit working . It loses connection after being plugged into the guitar for a while . Not worth ten cents .
2 #### Suction does not stay on - in summer it falls off the windshield . The angle is kind of awkward so I had to have it upside down and when I tried to adjusted the tiny link between mirror and suction snapped .
1 #### This product did not work with my ipad2 . I would not recommended purchasing this item for your ipad2 . DON'T BUY ! !
1 #### I got the nomad II toaday and it was a complete disappoinment . The memory card placement is not readily accessible compared to RIO . You ca n't swap smartcards with ease because you have to open the battery case in the back ( not the easiest of tasks specially the one i bought) .. and the headphones ( backphones or whatever they call it ) which looks so nice in the picture is crap . You ca nt even adjust the damn thing ! One size fits all kinda deal .. Not really impressed with this one except for the fact that it has FM radio and a voice recorder which is kinda cool .. overall , not a good buy and I would not recommend at all ....
5 #### Sturdy and durable craftsmanship . Bought for my grandma in Mexico , had it installed and works great . Has awesome mobility to enjoy your television from countless angles in your room .
5 #### It is fun to have a cover that everyone else does not have . Works great and I love it . Thanks
2 #### I am on my third one and love the call quality . I really love the swing out mic that turns the earpiece on and off . You can save a lot of battery life by having it off until you get a call . Swing out the mic and answer the call by the third ring . But , and this is a huge BUT , the swing out mic is also the weak point . The wires in the arm eventually weaken or break . At first it will sound like you are far off and then it might not work at all . As such , I can not recommend this earpiece to others .
5 #### Replaced my former one that had a weird installation method , which always crack and broke . This installs with the current bolt holes on the underside of your hood . No rattle , vibration , or anything . Had it on six months now and HIGHLY recommend this manufacturer for your bug / rock shield needs .
4 #### Worked well , four stars because the heads are s but bulky . I was able to compress the springs on my Dodge 2500 without the safety pins ( spring diameter was a little too large ) . Saved some time and effort when adding a 2.5 inch leveling kit .
5 #### This stuff is easy to use and provides excellent shine to all my plastic trim . Will not last more than 1 rain but looks good when it counts .
5 #### I 'm using the cable to connect a router to a desktop . It works fine
5 #### Good cover . These do n't last forever . I do n't think any of them do .
5 #### This battery was for an older LG phone . It was the same battery as the original and a LG brand . Works well with phone and the phone works like new . The battery arrived about four days earlier than estimated arrival date . My origianl battery can no longer hold a charge . This battery resolved the problem .
5 #### the user guide that comes with mindstorms nxt 2.0 is useless . this is an excellent and gentle introduction to robot building and programming . only cons : shame the book ca n't be printed in color and the starting robot is not the same as the " quick start " mindstorms robot .
5 #### I used the kit as directed and my guitar looks great and the fret board feels wonderful . I 've been playing guitar for a long time but never bought one of these kits cause I was young and stupid and thought it was more rock to have beat up and dirty instruments . It 's rock to keep your instruments in good repair and looking fresh . Get this kit . It comes with everything you need ( polishing cloths and sandpaper ) to make your guitar look and sound wonderful .
3 #### After reading the reviews , I thought this bag would be bigger than it actually is . It really only has room for the camera with attached lens and a pocket for a few extras such as filters or cards . I would prefer a bag that can hold an extra lens , but the conical shape prevents that .
5 #### OK , this is my second review for these earbuds . I deleted my first review and upgraded my rating for these earbuds , because after looking around and trying to figure out some ways to get these earbuds to stay on better , I saw that a number of other ear buds come with these wire or plastic loops attached to the earbuds . Instead of attaching a loop to the earbuds , I wondered , why not just put these MX-500 's on upside down and loop the wires over and behind the ears ? And it works ! I can twist my head all around now and jump up and down and these buds wo n't come out . I 'm sure other people have already figured this out also , but then I 've never seen anybody wearing earbuds upside down . The MX-500 has that classic Sennheiser sound - a gorgeous , rich clarity in the mid - range and highs , without an excessive boost in the bass . The bass tends to be somewhat variable , and depends on how closely coupled the earbuds are to the earhole . The more tightly fitting these buds are shoved into place , the louder the bass . This is true for all earbuds that are not designed to completely seal the earhole like an earplug . The big advantage of these open earhole buds , of course , is that you do n't have to deal with issues like ear wax on the sealing plug , etc .
2 #### Not secure , and does not fit my HTC EVO 4 phone . It seems small even for the G1 , but I do not have one to test . I did not realize that there was closing system such as even a zipper . I knew there was no secure flap .
3 #### It cleaned well , but I was expecting it to bead the water much better and longer than it did . Not quite worth the premium cost .
5 #### fit perfectly- I would recommend this product to any one . quality and easy to put on great product thanks dan
5 #### It 's from Nokia . Works great , as it should . Great Price . There was a mix up with the wrong part being sent , but the company set it straight .
5 #### I have a truck that now sits outside unused for too long . Even my expensive , heavy duty battery runs out of juice after a couple of weeks . I mounted this to the L - bracket and then placed the bottom of the bracket underneath the battery to secure it . The cord could be a couple of inches longer , but I found a way to keep it poking under the hood . I 've used it through a very cold winter and my truck has started right up every time .
4 #### I like it although the picture show a different device that I received . But the phone is good
5 #### I loved this case , it was fairly easy to put on the phone . Is a nice snug fit and looks pretty . It protects the back of the phone from scratches . I have dropped my phone many times , and this seems to do well in protecting it .
5 #### EB - always delivers and the price is right . Nothing else to say !
4 #### The Canon ef 100 mm f/2.8 is a perfect lens for a narrow band of applications . For portaits and life size ( full picture of a small object ) it serves very well . However , I found it difficult to give up the flexibility of my 17 - 85 mm zoom lens . I do n't carry a pack of lenses around so the versatility of the 17 - 85 mm trumps most other characteristics most of the time . Do n't get me wrong , the 100 mm is of excellent quality , with no problems . It is capable of very sharp photos and is fun to use . Some people say it 's too heavy . I do n't think so . Its weight and size do n't bother me at all ( I use it on my 350xt ) . I 've gotten some very sharp and interesting pictures using it . However , wide angle capability and being able to compose pictures by including or excluding elements of the scene has spoiled me . ( I would have liked a little more zoom on the 17 - 85 mm though . ) The net result is that I occasionally use this macro , and very much enjoy it when I do . I 'm happy with it and recommend it for portraits and closeups , and even as a walk around lens provided you can compose the picture by walking where you need to be .
5 #### Now this is a nice fan . A bit of a power hog on high but it moves a lot of air . Was awesome in our tent when the temperature was hot at night .
5 #### Fits nice and snug 10x better than the factory one that blew off going down the road . Shipped faster than I thought it would so that 's always a plus . Bought it for my 2014 Heartland Northtrail spare tire
5 #### So worth having a K&N filter . Clean with the kit and it 's ready to go all over , no more laying out more money .
5 #### It came on the date it said to be here and it is amazing ! This is just beautiful ! The nice little box it comes with and the look is just amazing ! I could easily mistake this for something around 80 . I played each note with the piano keys and it is tuned perfectly ! I 'm a lead in the school musical and not only does this help me have my note for the start of songs but also to help my clients in my studio if I do n't know the note myself . It 's embarrassing having to pull out my piano app on my iPhone . This pitch pipe makes it seem all more professional when I try to find a pitch . I am deff going to buy more if this one ever breaks or I lose it . The color is amazing and it looks so classy . Love it ! Really recommend it ! There was never a doubt and this is one of the best investments ever ! ! ! ! ! Must buy !
5 #### These Thule load stops work exactly as promised . A great addition to a Thule rack system
5 #### This has boosted our signal from 1 bar to 4and 5 bars . I would defiantly recommend this product .
5 #### Works great on the iPhone , you barely notice is there . I like it because you can slide the phone in your pockets very easily ... impossible to do with silicon protectors .
5 #### A great product to quickly clean your car , however it does n't replace washing it with soap and water .
5 #### Works well on tightly wound springs . Used on the front springs of my accord with no clearance problems . No flex or wear but make sure you lubricate the bolt threads with anti - seize compound .
4 #### i think it is a great item should keep making them try them in more colors would buy them again
5 #### This cable was just fine thank you so much for getting it to me on time and for such a good price .
5 #### Have only been using this , Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable ( 10 ft ) , for a month , or so . It seems to be made very well , but time will tell . The connection to my guitar and amp appears to be solid , and I 'm satisfied . I will report back if , and when , there is anything of notice .
5 #### No issues with this cable at all . The ends hold firm in my switch , and have survived about a half dozen unpluggings / repluggings . The molding around the plug is strong and the cables flexible . Will buy again if need more
5 #### Oh my Gadd ! These feel incredible . A little shorter than I like for drumset work but just perfect for snare , pad and even pillow practice . Excellent feel and response and the finish just feels amazing in your hand . A+ ! Have n't tried them yet but I suspect these will be great on an electronic kit too as I tend to set the pads closer than on a standard acoustic kit .
5 #### Genuine Fender , 3 ply , retail packaging . It was exactly what it was supposed to be . Fit my MIM without an modification .
2 #### Using the word " Restorer " is a bit of a stretch . I 'd say it is a decent cleaner but do n't expect to transform your vinyl or leather with this product . If you have light stains or dirt you 'll probably have pretty good luck with this product .
5 #### In my opinion this book is a better value than " Macbook Pro for Dummies " . It 's a great reference to have on hand .
5 #### Great value for the $ $ .... works as advertised to protect my winshield and side cabin windows
1 #### I always thought Bushnell is a very good product , and I was very disappointed with this purchase . it was so difficult to focus and looks like lens are defective , spend a little more on a better quality product .
5 #### This is a good grease gun . Sturdy construction , very strong spring , nice coating . It has a flexible hose with the typical zert tip on it . Tip for others who buy this , it clips on so well it is a challenge to get off the zert , this tip has three sections , simply loosen the tip most section hand tight , when removing from zert if it is stuck , loosen that section almost off and it falls off . Do not force it , it will fall off if you loosen this . I expect it will loosen up on its own as I use it more .
5 #### This is the best way to go next to buying another phone to expand your storage . works great its like getting a new phone .it broth new life into an old phone with no more storage space
5 #### fantastic . Purchased for a gift for my brother for his birthday .
4 #### The tone output is great , but they go dull and start rusting within a couple of days even if I meticulously clean them after playing . Could be just the ocean near by but I gave up .
1 #### Broke three of my CD 's the first day I owned it . I blame myself for buying 1990 's technology when I should have invested in MP3 / Ipod technology ( which I did ) . CD 's and CD changers like this are dead technologies . Sorry , but that 's the way it is . Amazon compensated me with a $ 20.00 credit for the broken CD 's , so they certainly have done their part . I love Amazon.com .
5 #### Been a fan of another company ... but wow ! ! These strings are great ... Good harmonics , very brilliant tone , and I love the way my fingers dig into them . Way to go D'Addario ! ! !
4 #### Great bag for the price . I needed a bag to throw me helmet , gloves , and tape in and this filled the bill perfectly . Only 4 stars because this is a no frills bag - the handles , zipper , and lining are its only features .
5 #### I have had many different hitch tighteners but this one is by far the best . Best quality and toughest one out there
4 #### Set up was simple . Plug and play . I 've been using Belkin products for nearly 20 years . Never a problem . Recommended .
5 #### Before buying this cable , we had gone through several cables that either did n't work , poorly fit or only lasted a short while in active use . Thus far no problems with this cable , function , fit and durability are good .
5 #### Colorfully labeled , this surge protector like power strip is very easy to use to coordinate all your electronic devices . It takes the guesswork out of which plug goes to what device .
5 #### Does not take a lot but what a shine it leaves behind . Would highly recommend it .
5 #### Easy to install and setup . Extra space not badly priced . Acer C720
5 #### The camera I set up for my desktop , had a really short cord . It was n't long enough to plug it in , and set the cam on top of the monitor . This gives plenty of room to comfortably wrap it behind the table and the desktop , with no cords in sight .
4 #### The Polish is junk . It 's extremely hard to polish out . I would not buy this again .
5 #### It perfect fits on my POD HD500 and it has enough space in the front pocket for the extra cables . Excellent .
2 #### It worked for about a week or so . An then it decided t stop working . it was nice while it did .
5 #### These were for my hubby , who loves these thin picks for playing his acoustic guitar . Glad we can find these easily on Amazon .
5 #### What else can I say ? it works and its worth the money . I trust Belkin , they make great products
5 #### Works perfectly to hook a Wii U to an old CRT TV via component .
5 #### I originally bought this for my electric guitar , but the day it arrived was also the day that I happened to break my string on my acoustic . This tool took the place of 3 , pin remover was very nice as the Acoustic had not been restrung in about 15 years , and the pegs were stiff . The Winder saved the wrist a lot of hand motions , and fit easily , and the wire cutter performed exactly as I thought it would , it cut the string . Maybe it was how i cut all 6 strings , but it left a dull end , not a deadly , stinging , scraping end , a nice little bonus .
5 #### This is a good sturdy " home " case . I bought it for my Nighthawk and the fit is not exact , but the slop is not excessive . It is nice and snug on a Les Paul . Decent padding and stout enough structurally to be stackable . Not a trustworthy " travel " case ~ definitely not airline proof unless you just get lucky . Interior compartment is standard capacity , fasteners are adequate , not outstanding . Pretty good handle and overall the case is functional considering the price point .
5 #### Better quality than I was expecting . I am definitely satisfied . Planet waves / D'addario make great products .
4 #### A mouse is a rather personal decision . People 's tastes and requirements when it comes to mice ( and keyboards ) vary greatly upon what they do with their computer . I tend to be very hard on mice ; The Logitech MouseMan Wheel Optical is my third mouse in 12 months . Thus far I am very satsified with it . The Ups : great feel . My previous mouse was the MS Intellimouse Explorer ( the grey one ) . In contrast , the MS mouse felt very cheap to me . The tactile response on the Logitech is much better ( the buttons have a nicer ' click ' feel ) . In fact , the thumb button on the MS mouse broke ( stuck ON , of course ) which lead me to try this one . How it illuminates was also a nice surprise . The Downs : Logitech makes a great piece of hardware , but I do not like their drivers as much as the MS mouse . The Logitech drivers do not work in all games the same way as the MS drivers do . Some games do not even register the wheel turning ( very disappointing ) . Overall : Probably the best mouse out there for the cost ( or regardless of cost , for that matter ) . I love the feel and would recommend this mouse over any other that I 've used to this point .
5 #### Excellent mandolin pick , comparde to big rock and more expensive picks on the market , but for a much better price .
5 #### Perfect replacement for the last one my dog chewed up . It works perfect and even came with some cheap batteries . It arrived quickly and was double packed inside a heavily padded envelope . Will buy again if my dog gets ahold of this one !
5 #### I bought this conditioner last year for my leather furniture and have been very happy with the results . It does need to be applied every few months , but I 've used it on a variety of leather surfaces ( worn leather sofa , dining room chairs with leather padding , office chair ) with excellent results . As long as you do n't apply it too thick , it wo n't leave an oily residue , and it blends into the leather very nicely . I 've gone through the original bottle and a refill , and am about to order another refill . For application , the Lexol sponges work great . They can be rinsed and reused and last a long time .
4 #### Does the job , and reasonably priced at $ 1.99 . Using it for a ham radio application , and it seems to work well , with little extra noise introduced .
5 #### Need I say more . It works and it works beautifully , even as an emergency de - icer ! Buying a case of this stuff for the Amazon sale price woith free shipping was kind of a no - brainer . Plus good to stock up before the coming sales tax fiasco . Although I like the convenience of the big Spray bottle ( which has a stellar diffuser ) , This large size bottle is still much smaller , easier to store in the car and significantly cheaper than buying the sprayer , unless you find a good sale . I think on the spray verison you are paying $ 2 - 3 just for the packaging , I do n't really seem to get more covverage with that one an it does not seem to last as long as this large bottle . Everyon got a bottle for Chirstmas this year ( except the kids ) .
5 #### I had low expectations when I purchased this product as the price seemed " to good to be true " , but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised . This hi hat clutch is solid and looks and feels very durable . I plan to update this review in a few weeks after I have some time to actually put some time on it , but so far it seems well worth the price . Dare I say a steal ? UPDATE ( 2/12/2013 ): I have been using this clutch daily for over 3 months and so far not a single problem . At this point , durability does not seem to be an issue .
4 #### This works really well and gets the dust off . It will not scratch your vehicle .
5 #### i love this phone . this is my first ever time owning a blackberry and i like how it is unlocked so i can use any kind of carriers
5 #### Much better than even 100W 9005 bulbs , without over doing the system current . The best 9005 bulbs out there .
1 #### I bought this to install a Boss Stereo from Amazon Prime into my 2004 Ford Focus . It is labeled for VW but my garage said it fits my 2004 Ford Focus . I thought it odd but assumed that it was correct . It is nt ! Spent the morning in the shop connecting the adapter to my Boss Radio . I removed the stock Radio and found the adapter had no compatibility with my Focus at all ! I found a Focus Radio schematic on YouTube and will proceed to do a wire by wire connection . Pictures show the adapter and stock Radio .
1 #### very low quality . Spend a little more money if you 're looking for a decent cutter
5 #### I had some tiny black spots on a white vinyl roof from I do n't know what . I scrubbed it pretty good with this stuff ( cleaner ) and it did OK . For all I know it 's paint that got on there , so I ca n't expect a miracle . I am very very pleased with the finish after applying the protectant though . This is a product you ca n't really judge with one application . I 'm looking forward to it preserving the top .
4 #### Almost perfect ! Only complaint is that it does n't fit in your hand super well , but who cares I guess , it feels sturdy and does the job fine . There is a little bit of play between the lug and the key itself if that sort of thing bothers you , but it is negligible .
4 #### Wish it had more flat surface that rested against radiator .
5 #### Installed on a 1992 Chevy C2500 Suburban . Perfect fit and an easy install . Looks great and very functional .
5 #### Great item if you are interested in volume control with out dealing with the interface all the time ( PPC )
5 #### This is a really good case , I have one on a different phone and it is super . I have dropped my phone many time 's and no problems at all . I have taken my phone out of the case just to look at it and I do n't even have a scratch on it . Great seller fast shipping no problems at all .
5 #### So great great sound combined with a russian vintage capacitor in tone it kills .
5 #### We use these for our office voip phones , great sounding and well made for the price .
4 #### It 's a decent product . I installed it on my Stellar Labs square tube stand , but I had to use some wood shims to make if fit , as the internal clamps are made for a smaller diameter tube . I 'm satisfied with it .
5 #### Samsung Convoy did n't fit . Good quality case if you have a very small flip
2 #### Reducing my rating to 2 stars as the nozzles are all getting plugged up and no amount of " massaging " will clear them . I 've even tried taking the shower head down and pouring CLR into it and letting is soak with little improvement . We do n't have particularly hard water where I live so I was not expecting to be having this issue .
1 #### Bought 4 phones . They are falling apart . Asked for return . Been after two months . Do n't buy
4 #### Use it to send an audio signal to outdoor speakers from my surround sound receiver . works good to not overload my Receiver it does not keep the signal seprarete . when i m watching a movie inside the left and right signal are one in the same somehow .
4 #### I do n't need to add much , as this great little headset has been covered pretty well in previous reviews . I just wanted to add another vote . It 's great for phone conversations -- I can hear others very well , and they say they can hear me . I regret , however , that I did not notice it works only for phone conversations . I can run my music through the car stereo , so that 's not a source of irritation -- but I really wish it would pick up navigation assistance from my Galaxy S3 . This device nearly made it to the five star category despite that shortcoming .
5 #### I really like these headphones ! I got them to replace the little buds that were always falling out of my ears during my power walk . They are comfortable and great value for the money . I use them with my mp3 player . Highly recommend ! Only problem is the size ; I had to get a larger container to store them .
5 #### Great price with rebate . Installed fine and got my DVR , Blu Ray and TV all on the internet at once Small box that is easily hidden and can be wall mounted though I have not done that .
4 #### It could be a bit brighter , but I love this gadget , great for reading in bed without having ceiling or lamp lights on .
5 #### This is a great addition to my collection of USB cables . It makes them more versatile and saves me lots of money as I do n't need to but a bunch of different cables
1 #### Did not last that long . Quality is not that great . If you work in Construction , this is not the phone pouch for you .
2 #### This case might be okay if you are just transporting things from the trunk of your car to a gig , but this case is not worth considering if you plan to fly with it . First of all , the latches are both flimsy and exposed to shearing on both sides . This case has been through about 4 round trips , and already one of the latches is bent and coming apart . The latches can easily open during travel , so tie wraps are a must in order to secure them into place . The case itself is okay , fairly light duty and the power strip is of nice quality . This is not a professional product .
5 #### Allows me to synchronize my contact with Outlook & use my phone as a modem . I can transfer pictures and ringtones from my computer to my phone and from my phone to my computer . It even works with my wife 's Verizon V3 m , some tinkering was required to get the multimedia features to work on the Verizon phone ( instructions were supplied my the vendor ) , but at the end everything works great ! ! As an added benefit if I get a new phone I do n't have to worry because this kit works with almost all Motorola phones .
5 #### These are superb binoculars for being small and light enough to fit in a pocket and thus readily available to observe wildlife and birdwatch . At the same time they have enough power and a nice wide field of view to be very versatile and perfect for all kinds of situations . I have pairs of high magnification wide angle binoculars which for many situations are what is required but these compacts are so much lighter I find myself using them instead just because they 're more convenient and comfortable . I wear variable lens glasses and these binoculars work just fine with the cups folded and also unfolded when I perch my glasses up . The relief seems to be about right for me at least . Finally the price is truly excellent and it 's a mystery to me how such excellent optics are produced at such a low cost .. They are a great deal .
4 #### Real nice Guitar Picks . It came in a 6 piece pack , they deserve the Dunlop brandname because these things last a long time .
4 #### It 's hard to gush about a cable , but this was the right amount of cable for a short run , and it worked fine , and the price was good . You have to order it as an add on with something else to make the shipping work .
5 #### Crisp sound , good sustain . High quality product at a reasonable price . The cymbal has a good tin sound and looks nice . Very satisfied with these cymbals .
5 #### very nice covers but they were missing the foam inserts
1 #### I 've owned and used AKG K240s ( and the discontinued K240DF ) for more than a decade . The quality of the product has fallen CONSIDERABLY since manufacturing moved to China . To be truthful , this was never a particularly durable headset , but the old models made in Europe were head and shoulders above what AKG is shipping now . They feel flimsy coming out of the box , and the product I received has a poor solder connection internally that makes the right channel audio cut out when you turn your head . The plastic ear cup is already partially cracked and I 've used them for just two months in studio . The ear padding is n't as soft or comfortable as the old model , either . Sonically , they are everything I 'd like my headphones to be , but that does n't matter when I can only hear in one ear . I wo n't be buying AKG headphones again in the near future .
1 #### Broken when it got here , not worth trying to return .
5 #### Smoking while driving in the rain . These are a must . Good directions and easy install .
4 #### This blue tooth is easy to use , quick to charge , and clear for listening and talking . If windy I can not use it at all , but other than that I love it ! ! I use it with my Samsung Epic .
5 #### It is amazing ! I highly recommend it because it is long enough and is always working
5 #### It is well written and has been helpful . I have discovered a few things that helped me to use more functions in my Mac Book Pro laptop . R/ KMW
3 #### It 's not a real Chamois since it is made with PVA . It does soak up rather nicely and is very smooth so it wo n't cause streaks unless you get it dirty . Overall it 's okay , nothing special . I bought mine , I see a lot of the reviews are from people that got this product free . It 's not nearly as good as the star rating would make you believe , but it is adequate .
2 #### Does not provide much extra field of view , hard to adjust , does n't strike me as being a very secure mount . Previous towing mirror had an additional tether cord that wrapped around the mirror mount in case the main mount let go . Do n't think this one will last long , but purchased for the right side mirror . Using the much better CIPA 11650 on the driver side&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/CIPA-11650 - Deluxe - Door - Mount - Towing - Mirror / dp / B00029WRJQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">CIPA 11650 , Deluxe Door Mount Towing Mirror</a > , should have ponied up for one on each side .
3 #### I thought these would be sturdier , but they are not the highest quality brackets . The turning screw part has a plastic handle and I kept thinking it would break when I tightened the clamp . It does the job , but I was expecting a better construction material on the turn screw since that is the main thing you put your trust in .
5 #### Fits my Epiphone Les Paul Standard perfectly . Material appears sturdy . Does not have very thick padding but I wanted the bag to protect my guitar from dust and minor bumps , which it does . The zippered pocket holds my strap , 2 sets of strings and picks . Maybe not the best bag but well worth the $ 19 I spent on it .
5 #### I love these . They are great for my acoustic . I like light - medium strings and these work great on them . Awesome !
5 #### This little thing does it 's job . Two separate pieces , one loops around the headstock , one around the strap , then they 've got a little plastic clippy that latches the two together . No tying , quick and easy to connect or disconnect .
2 #### Purchased to be used to adjust the volume of my Pro 4AAT phones while snoozing at night , the tiny volume control , no balance , and flimsy construction make these useless for me . At $ 10 , not worth the hassle of returning . Koss should not put their name on such a piece of junk . Next time , I 'll pay more and buy something better .
3 #### This capo works ok . It 's a little tough to open , but my biggest gripe is that I have a hard time getting the lower E string to work with this thing . I prefer other capos that I 've tried .
5 #### I bought these to use when parking our travel trailer and did not want to spend a fortune for something that does such a simple basic job . These do what they are supposed to do , appear to be solidly built and durable , and do not add a lot of weight while hauling them around . They also do n't take up much storage space .
5 #### I took a step into the unfamiliar and got this extra light gauge strings when I 'm use to heavy . I 've gotten to where I like to solo more and play bends so I thought I 'd try these out . I LOVE them . So bright . So much tone to these . They feel so natural and smooth under my fingers . I 've been using these for a few weeks now and they still have great tone .
5 #### This is so easy to use . I prefer the corded variety so I do n't have to worry about obstacles interfering with the operation . If I want to get into a group photo , I can always use the camera 's time delay . I used this to capture photos of small ( very fast ) birds at a bird feeder . The ability to take continuous pics was invaluable .
5 #### Awesome for D standard . I 'm not a metal player . I just like the voicing of a guitar in D standard and these strings get the job done .
5 #### Vandorens are my preferred brand . I purchased these for a student and he really likes the way they make him sound ! That being said , if you 're interested in finding a reed for your setup and do n't know where to start , I recommend one of their sampler packs . Like Rico , they make different cuts of reed that can help the player as well as define his tone .
1 #### I bought this at full price when I bought my iPhone 4 . I must say that I 'm extremely disappointed that they did n't get the sizing right , I 'd expect a poor fit from a inexpensive Chinese case but not a $ 30 Speck product . This case should have been recalled . The problem is that it 's too long ( and then stretches after you use it for some time ) and it constantly blocks the camera lens opening causing some " once in a lifetime " shots to be lost . After a few months of use , it had stretched to the point that the corners of it would pop off in my bag which obviously makes it less protective . Poor design . I love Speck products but doubt I 'll buy another unless I can test the fit before I purchase it . If it fit , I 'd give it 4 stars because it is quite protective without being overly bulky .
5 #### Excellent ties . Work well for holding cables together and do not come loose
5 #### In my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist . The crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as I can foresee .
5 #### Worked great to install a Clarion CZ509 stereo in a 1997 Dodge Caravan . Had to trim off a few pieces , directions mildly confusing in a couple instances because it is a kit used for so many scenarios , but I worked through it and it all turned out perfect .
2 #### The case was so smooth that it was borderline slippery . The snap on case did not snap together very well . The material does n't feel like it would protect anything . The only upside was that the case was very pretty . I would not recommend this case to anyone , and suggest sturdier alternatives instead .
4 #### Something did n't contact right at first , so i took it apart and re - assembled it and it works great now ! yay
5 #### It is a good little microphone . I used it for my ipod before they had built in mics
5 #### I was very , very pleased with this purchase . The connector was what I thought is was , the price was outstanding , and the shipping was quick . Very positive experience .
5 #### For the money , you ca n't beat them ! They cover my ears , are very comfortable on my head , and they deliver that " rumble " when watching a movie . Nice wide sound , and not nearly as " colored " as some pricier head phones . These are well - rounded for music , and the ambient sound delivery in video games is ridiculous ! I 've caught myself looking over my shoulder , not realizing what I 'm hearing is in the head phones !
4 #### This is NOT my first guitar . Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins . It 's not . Here 's what it is : An exceedingly well - constucted , AMAZINGLY playable guitar . Fit , finish , feel and action were all VERY nice ... Sound on the other hand ? Let 's face it . It 's plywood all around . It SOUNDS like plywood . But that does n't distract from the fact that it 's a great guitar for $ 100 bucks . It 's a fine " first " guitar . It 's a great beach / camping / cabin guitar . Leave it in your car to practice at lunch . Leave it in the office . ANY guitar is better than no guitar ... And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars . Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box ... New , premium strings DO make a difference . If your expectations are for a playable , rugged , affordable guitar you wo n't be disappointed . If sound quality is your primary concern , well ... You are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy . For my desired application , this guitar was great ... I 'm very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat .
1 #### This is not really good it souds too low but is fair for the price ...
5 #### Looks great , stays where you plant it , and no loose spots . I 've had one for years , and I bought this as a gift .
4 #### Use to polish my aluminum airplane . Works good with the " Nuvite " products and with the Porter Cable random orbit sander , gets into tight places
5 #### I love these heads ... Always have . They have a great " deep " tone with extremely well controlled ring , but still have tons of attack . If you 're a basher like me , you 'll love these heads . Just put them on , tune them up , and play away ! They sound awesome right " out of the box " .
4 #### My son got these for christmas , he is learning how to play the guitar , so he is n't perfect yet , but working on it .
5 #### What a great cassette player . I have a lot of older recordings , mostly lecture tapes which I tried to convert to MP3 ( what a hassle ) . I found this beautiful cassette player that fit the bill perfectly , It reminds me of some of the early players that were the first to appear on the market . Although plastic , it has a very heavy duty feel , all the buttons have that very solid touch to them . I 'm not sure how it would sound with music recordings , probably not a good quality for music .
4 #### I bought the tool to see why my light came on and to reset it to get an inspection sticker . I looked up on several web sites to see what tool was recommended . This one was noted in consumer reports as a best buy at double the price ! It by no means has all the bells and whistles and there are models with many more readouts however this one can give you the code number then explains it in english right down to what cyl . might be missfiring or where an injector my be messed up . It then can reset the codes with one push of the reset button . Great tool great price and Amazon had it to my house overnight ! Ordered it at 2PM and it was at my house by noon the next day .
1 #### The mounting holes of this light are 45 degrees off the vertical or horizontal axis of the holes on the electrical box . It is impossible to mount correctly without some unsightly drilling .
4 #### There are lots of nicer versions of tuna strainers , but all I needed was something that I could wash that would fit both the large cans and small cans . This fits that need perfectly . It 's two separate pieces that twist to lock together or that you can unlock with a twist to use the middle smaller part for regular sized tuna cans . It fits nicely into both size cans . I was initially a little worried that it would be hard to hold the little wavy handle while draining cans , but unless I get it wet and slick , it 's fine . It 's perforated with small holes , but so far they have n't gotten jammed up and it 's quick and easy to hand wash . I take it apart when I wash it and then put it back together when it 's dry . So pros- Inexpensive two sizes to fit most cans easy to clean bright blue , easy to find in a utensil drawer Cons- the handle gets a bit slick if it gets wet
3 #### Got the product in the time allowed . I have other stylus and was expecting about the same size . There are much smaller than what I have . I wanted to use it with my iPad . However , after getting used to the size , it works great with my iPhone . So overall I recommend this product .
5 #### I was very happy with this mount for my situation . I mounted a 50 " Vizio to it that is about 35 lbs . No issues at all with the weight and it moves easily just as I needed .
3 #### This CD Lens Cleaner did n't work for our broken system that could no longer read CDs . But it has worked on systems in the past . Simple and fast to use , you just pop it into the player like a regular CD . There is none of the nonsense with fluids like they had in the old days . It 's a simple mechanism- it has a small brush - like device that gently cleans the laser lens . So look at it like this : this is a cheap investment to try something that might work for your broken CD / DVD player .
5 #### My first smartphone :) It worked perfectly and is functioning still .
5 #### I bought this as a small gift for someone who got a " boring " looking Centro . It is exactly what I was looking for . It slipped right on . It fits well . So far it appears to be durable enough . It does n't prevent access to any features on the Centro .
5 #### Battery life is great ! I use it for paintball and hunting . Look for my review on the radios , buy the Trisquares , I have tried many other products and these truly are the best . 1000 yards in dence woods with no problem . The VOX kit here works flawlessly .
5 #### This is a solid peace of equipment , sturdy , reliable all of which makes for a very well transmission . Thank you .
5 #### I put it in my motorcycle gas tank for winter storagev every year . Works great .
5 #### Very cool stuff I used it because I trimmed out my fenders on my jeep and flat fendered the front fenders and I needed to run flares to be street legal and they are awesome you just use however much u need . Although the screws that come with them do n't work small self tappers work way better if your going into sheet metal .
5 #### Good heavy duty mudflaps . The hardware is trash but the flaps themselves are great . Worth the money .
5 #### These are such good strings that my buddy took a pair and put them on his 99 $ acoustic and it sounded semi - professsional . They may be more expensive , but they play better , last longer , and sound unbelievable . Turns every acoustic into a Taylor .
5 #### All these years of propping music up against stuff , clipping it to whatever , using clipboards , etc . This is a great help , plus is light enough to carry in the suitcase . Made in the USA , too , I think :)
4 #### awesome color vivid crystal clear ... a bit harder no apple window fits perfect but of kind of hard plastic mainly for the button touching ....
3 #### This fits my T1i fine but it is not exactly like the original . Still recommend but a little diappointed that it was not an exact replica .
5 #### This case is great for a Samsung A900 / Blade or Samsung A707 / Sync . It 's a perfect fit a little more free movement for the A900 but great fit nonetheless . The case is made out of good materials , great soft yet durable leather and the price is even better . Best case you will find for any of these two phones for this price . Highly recommended
5 #### All i can say is that this phone is just wow ! ! ! ! ! ! . Every body who sees it keep saying wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and even my wife and mother inlaw , who are very difficult to please especially with phones , keep saying wow ! ! ! ! ! Everything about this phone is wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you want more wows about this phone , search for amazon.com or google on a special exotic case for this phone ( beyza case for nokia e71 , it is well expensive but believe me , you will stand out from the rest of the world . visit the company website ENJOY RICARDO
5 #### Noticed the difference is sound and power . Install is a little time consuming when it comes to mounting the air box but not overly complicated . May ned to run to hardware store to get a nut or bolt . Worth the price in the end
5 #### Sounds nice and deep on a 98 jeep Cherokee 4.0
5 #### Send them back due to me not liking them , I was expecting them to be bigger , but heard great things about them
5 #### First time using this brand . I like them , they seem to last a little longer than the other brand I was using .
5 #### This is the first book I have read by this author and I absolutely fell in love with her unique style of writing . The storyline captured me from the very first page and I hated to see this story end . I enjoyed all of the secondary characters and I ca n't wait to read about their stories in the rest of this series .
1 #### I thought all of these were a standard size , but apparently not because it does not fit in my Jeep Commander . So it may work fine in other vehicles , you 'd have to take a chance and find out .
5 #### Good strings recommended by my musician engineer friend as his strings of choice
5 #### Seriously this is a handy gadget that I wish I had found year 's ago . This is a cleverly designed and manufactured product that pulls oil from crankcases and stores it in the global container . It works quite well .
5 #### For the nominal price these are fanatastic ! I do n't really have any others to compare to , but what more could you want ? Great sound ! I 'm so happy with them . Now I can jam - out without disturbing other family members ...
5 #### The case slips on very easily and feels very solid but lightweight . It makes the iPhone a * tiny * bit bigger , but still small enough to slip into a pocket easily . The surface adds friction to make the phone feel slightly nubby to the touch , but still slides into a pocket without a problem . All of the buttons are easily accessible as is the charger connection port . The back interior is felt - lined so you do n't have to worry about the hard case scratching the back of your iPhone if you decide to remove / replace later . The picture makes it out to be a rubberized appearance ... the actual product looks more metallic , and is more purplish ( but is still blue ) than the picture shows . Ordered this color and the orange .
5 #### I just love this little phone . I know , it 's a dinosaur but dang , if all you want is a durable , easy to use phone for text and calls it ca n't be beat . Be aware that if you buy any Verizon phone , it can not be used with any other service , ever . Verizon has their phones built with no SIM . , so be sure that you have their service if you buy one of their phones used
5 #### In considering transporting our road bikes , I looked at several types of bike racks . The inconvenience of having to lug around a hitch based bike rack made that decision easy . We have a 2014 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner with the bed channel system . This was the most convenient option , so I purchased two Clutch SD 's . They were very easy to install . I read some of the reviews about the skewers rusting due to the elements . There is a quick easy solution to this concern . Take the skewers off and store them inside the cab when they are not in use . The main housing is painted black and appears that it will not corrode . The locks work well . I read one review that stated they purchased two Clutch SD 's from Amazon and received both keyed the same . This would have been nice , but I was not as fortunate . So I have two different keys for two different skewers . Not a big deal . The Clutch SD is the only way to go if you have a bed channel system . Although I have a friend who bolted them to a 2x6 piece of wood and affixed it to the bed of his truck . This works well for him too . To conclude , I highly recommend the Clutch SD , as I am very pleased with it .
5 #### Me llego en buenas condiciones y en el tiempo establecido , el producto es tal cual como se muestra en la imagen
5 #### This cleaner is one of the best that I have used that cleans really well without stripping or staining the vinyl . Highly reccomended for anyone who is looking to clean the inside of their car .
5 #### I have been re - engineering a theatre sound system and had added a yamaha powered mixer and speakers driven from the main mixer as stage monitors ... so far so good . In tech week , when the lights are in action the dimmers created a huge buzz in this setup , despite it being an entire balanced rig end to end ... so figuring it was noise injected into the mains by the dimmers i tried a couple of powere conditioners .... they did nothing at all ( tried stage 1 and stage II types ) . So in a frantic moment , as a last resort , I picked one of these up at a local store 2 hrs before opening night .. 5 seconds to install , completely cured the problem . I will be picking a couple up for my home use . an outstanding product .
5 #### These things are beautiful and sturdy . I am able to free up limited floor space in my studio by moving the guitars to the wall instead of floor stands . Wonderful !
4 #### The Capo works well but it is really not suited to the younger player . I got it for my 11yo who plays classical guitar and he had a very hard time putting on and taking off the capo . The spring did not get even marginally softer after a year of use . This could be a plus if you are an adult but I 've replaced it since with a screw tightening version .
5 #### I bought this a few years ago and used it at that time . This worked really well on my C5 Corvette oak color top . The color was not affected at all when I was done , but it was cleaner and shed water better . I followed the instructions closely and was very pleased with the results . Being paranoid , I covered all glass and painted surfaces of the car with plastic to prevent any overspray getting on those surfaces .
2 #### I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past . The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with a slot in the top , so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped . These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie . You have to wrap it carefully ( and not particularly tightly ) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks . If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off . These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described . One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you are n't going to be undoing them regularly . True , but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost .
4 #### Fast shipping via Amazon prime . Batteries are first rate , and work well . Super value !
3 #### I really ca n't tell if the result of double vision is that while they deliver it it felt or just that quality control is poor i really do n't know but mine as other reported already came with double vision problems . I heard someone saying its got to be with the alignment of the glass inside and that high power binocular are more difficult to get this alignment done properly but its a waste of my time thank god not of money that because a product is bad i have to spend time on buying this pair of binocular and then send them back . hopefully if you buy them they are good then I 'm pretty sure it will be awesome because i like the power they offer and how much light come through the lens . Go ahead and try your luck hopefully even if they are good they last long .
1 #### My review is based on one purchase of 3 - pack , so this is an account of my personal experience with this particular purchase and not a review based on extensive sampling of the brand . One out of the three reeds in the package was cracked and could not be played at all(reed case obscured the fault ) , one read was not cut well and will need some work and one reed appeared OK but , after playing it , I found it was much stiffer than indicated strength , so it will require more work . I found such obvious lack of quality control on part of manufacturer appalling . I bought quite of few reeds in the past ( some even without brand names ) and never before I was moved to write a negative review . I will never buy Rico Royal again .
5 #### Works great after a few uses . Make sure to set on newspaper as recommended .
5 #### they fit under a helmet , even if the padding does n't allow for helmet speakers , the sound quality is at least on par , and most importantly , they provide some hearing protection . they will probably get beat up and destroyed in several months to a year on the road , but the price is right for the use you get out of them . I have noticed that with my odd - shaped ear canals , they do begin to cause my ears to ache after several hours of use .
2 #### if anyone has a clue how to attach the 2 pair of black rubber earphone cushions , i 'd love to hear it . i ca n't tell by looking at and trying them how they fit on ! agreed about bad for music , plan to use it for skype away from home but have n't tested the quality of the mic . if you 've spent a lot on components and plan to use earphone 's with a mic a lot , get a better product than this .
4 #### This is a great deal . I picked up 3 bundles . If you have good technique you can make them last but EVERYTHING breaks after a while of beatinnon stuff . If your mashing than yeah , your gunna plow through a pack no problem . Wood will always break but it still sounds better than plastic or aluminum ! If your recording than get a better more expencive pair . It does make a difference ! But for gigging I always make shure I have a brick of these on hand .
5 #### First , are n't these colors fun ? That 's what initially attracted me to it . It 's a schoolbus yellow ( or American cheese if you do n't know what color a school bus is ) with a true orange home button . Second thing I love is the raised , bubble - like button that covers the home button . I use that key a lot and the raised surface makes it easy to find and press if I 'm not really paying attention . The only drawback is that , if your phone is sandwiched between two things -- like in a wallet , or between my chest and a pile of books or other stuff -- it activates voice search and one of my songs begins to play ! The cover does prevent you from docking the iPhone but it 's super - easy to take off and put on . It 's not a hassle at all . And the rubber is thick enough to absorb the shock of a fall . The material is quite flexible and soft feeling but the surface is smooth , not flocked or textured . It does n't stain easily -- I 've had my yellow cover since May and it 's still bright and clean . I 've dropped it in the dirt and sand a few times and , while the dirt does stick more than it would with a hard plastic shell , it wipes off easily and can be cleaned in the sink if necessary . I 'm going to order another one in different colors for Winter ...
4 #### They were good strings with a warm sound but still no comparison to D'Addario 's . The only reason they get 4 stars is because they were rather weak strings . After only 2 - 3months of having them on my guitar they broke ... almost one by one the only string that did n't snap was the low E and D string . Still I am happy I invested in them but I still recomend D'Addario 's .
1 #### Crappiest product on the market I bought this and the second day it lost signal do not buy this ever
5 #### Great product for the price I purchase it for a friend and they love it .
5 #### Have used them for years . They work great . You do need to re - wet them often , but that is par for the course .
2 #### The holster portion of the shell combo breaks easily . This is my fourth replacement and I had to buy the whole combo each time . The holding tabs on the holster easily break and snap off with a minimum drop or fall from as little as two feet . The shell itself does protect your device well .
5 #### Very good purchase for peace of mind regarding safety with the 6 ton capacity and locking feature . Cautionary note : Since these are taller than some stands , you 'll need to be sure that your jack will lift your vehicle high enough for these stands . My jack just barely does this at full extension .
5 #### It took longer to run down to the NAPA store to buy vacuum caps ( 3/16 " ) to block the lines than it did to install the hubs . Super easy , no mess , no fuss ( except the filthy vacuum lines ) , I should have done this a year ago when my auto hubs started acting up on my ` 04 F350 . I read that these hubs end up being recessed in the hubcaps ( because they do n't stick out as much as the stock auto hubs ) but this proved to be a non - issue . They are flush with the inside lip of the hubcap recess and do n't look out of place .
5 #### My phone ran out of memory . So I bought this card to store my phone stuff . I love it . I have n't even made a dent in the memory on this card . I would recommend .
5 #### This thing is great ! A little pricey but it 's exactly what I needed . You 've got the 16 ft cord , an on / off button and a reset switch in case you overload it . Plus , the cord can be wrapped around the diameter of the unit and plugged into itself so it has a small footprint when transporting it . Unless you are trying to plug a massive power adapter into the device , most people should be able to utilize all 6 plugs if needed . It also has decent rubber feet so it does n't slide off the surface you place it on . I believe you can also mount the base to a wall or table if desired .
4 #### These are very comfortable and does not fall off even during a rough bike ride . The sound quality ai n't half bad either . The only thing I would change is some of the wearable parts . I can understand the ear pads as they are replaceable but the foam piece right above the ears look a bit flimsy and might fall off over time and they are NOT replaceable .
5 #### I bought these upon recommendation of a friend . They replaced the original D'Addario J74 strings that came with my mandolin . I find the mediums a bit hard on my fingers so I chose lights , and am very happy with them . They have a very nice sound and brightness and because they are light , are so easy to play . I highly recommend these !
1 #### This patchcord was billed as a way to use my MS joystick with my current XP based computer . It did not work at all !
5 #### I started using these strings because Fender has them on most of their electric guitars but I recently heard Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top tell a story about being on a bill with BB King . BB said , " hey let 's exchange guitars so I can see what you play and you can see what I play . " Billy says BB told him he was using strings that were way too heavy . He told Billy to lighten up . Billy says that from then on he started using very light strings with an .08 on the high E which was even lighter than BB used . These strings are great but Fender does make lighter strings too . Give them a try . Listen up .
3 #### When I first got my Treo 650 I was so excited . It was one of my first PDA phones . With all the cool little hacks and apps for it , I thought it would be so cool . The Treo does have all the good functions for a PDA or phone but sucks when you put it together . After about 2 months I started to experience the little glitches . Browsing was a pain . Also after a while whenever I had an incoming call it would sometimes shut off and restart . I do n't know what was wrong with it but it got very annoying . Had this phone for about 6 months before I had to switch it up . Also it 's a little bulky .
5 #### i do a lot of networking local supplers want to much started looking online found these at a great price will be buying more
5 #### these things work and look great . worth the money and it is nice to leave the window cracked a few inches when raining and keeps the windows from fogging up while driving in that rain storm . one good buy on these and great quality also .
5 #### The perfect strings , IMO -- but they will warp your nicer fender guitar necks etc . if you do n't know how to properly setup your truss - rod and springs etc .
4 #### I bought these picks to add to the supply of various thickness picks . I 've only used one of them and it worked fine
4 #### nice mirror .. It is full size .. just so you know ..
4 #### Great item for fifteen bucks .... I was hoping there was more metal to it , but I 'm satisfied with what I paid for .
5 #### Switch works as expected got connected my POE cameras and printer . That freed up ports on my router for computers that needs faster speeds . Remember this switch has max throughoutput only 100MBps so it wo n't be good if you want to copy large files through it .
4 #### Just received the headset and works great . Yes the cord on the right side is long and the mic rests on your chin but I am used to that ; my Samsung Sync headset did the same thing . Music sounds good and calls are loud and clear . I received my shipment in 2 working days too . Great job !
5 #### All in one baby , what more could a carbon based lifeform tryikng to change his stirngs want ?
5 #### I love the feel of these sticks . They are weighted and balanced perfectly in my opinion . The are also super durable . I have never broken one . A single pair last me a while even with everyday playing .
4 #### Plugged into a P4 machine , created a partition , and formatted to EXT3 then loaded it with stuff that needed some organization . Went to Seagate 's site with model and serial numbers , found it had a firmware update , applied the update as per instruction , then when back to shoveling files around . The hot plugged into a NAS and set it up for more storage there . Works , no surprises .
4 #### Can see the same welding issues as the other users , though I 'm not sure if it would affect the maximum load ( 2 tons ) the jack stands can hold . Sturdy jack stands , might be slightly high for some cars , depending on what you are trying to do ( being too high is n't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more ) . Overall , simple no frills car jack stands . Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked , as well as the regular locking handle .
5 #### this antenna really helped with my tecsun pl350 to bring in the sw signal .
5 #### looks cute , works great . the holes are small - so it was a struggle to get on . But it is well made , and because the holes were small - i feel confident knowing it will stay connected .
2 #### these were ok . i did not know that i did not need them .. but one of the pens did not have a bottom rubber part to it
5 #### WORKS GREAT ! MAKE SURE TO ONLY PLUG IT UP TO ONE DEVICE HOWEVER .
1 #### I wanted something small and easy to use . Basically just keep track of my route while hiking in the woods so I could find my way back to the truck . This unit is slow , unreliable and has poor battery life . It 's a neat toy if you are walking around in your yard . Save your money and buy a better model if you are really going to have to rely on it to find your way out of the woods . Oh , BTW , even the slightest canopy or cloud cover and you 'll lose your signal .
5 #### No one told me that I CAN'T HEAR YOU ... since I 'm using it . Thanks to jabra
3 #### these are more designed for the htc HD2 or 7 . these work , but they are n't cut to spec . they have the nice gloss that i like and you can make them work without having to cut them to fit or anything , so i will use them and they will do the job .
1 #### Oh darn , I should have read the reviews before I bought this . Tried everything I could think of to make this work short of ripping the tape out of the cassette and rubbing it on the vcr heads . The cleaner would nt play more than a couple seconds and eventually locked up the player . Had to unplug the vcr and plug it back in to eject the cassette . Amazon said this item is non - returnable so all I can do is eat the money spent and give this item and the seller one star . Stay away from this item !
5 #### Love this mic ! For the price you ca n't go wrong and for he quality this is an amazing deal . Sound quality is great very low noise floor , the shock mount is perfect .
5 #### I replaced the original strings on my Epiphone Masterbuilt DR500 - MCE ( which were possibly the same brand strings ) as soon as I unpacked it . ( I never bother messing with the factory strings since you do n't know what they are or how long they have been out of packaging ) . Initially these did n't seem to have that nice harmonic sound I expected and was n't sure if it was the guitar with its fresh " wood " that had n't cured yet or the strings . After playing for a few hours , it came to life . I had read that new strings sometimes had to be broken in , but never experienced it on my other guitars ( with mostly GHS and Martin strings ) . WOW , it sounds great now and I will be using these from now on .
5 #### Purchased this primarily to pair with new iPad and secondarily with a bluetooth cellphone . Packaging and quality feel of the unit is excellent . This is not a cheap device . You do pay a bit more for the quality . It pairs with the iPad perfectly following the easy directions in the owners manual . iPad discovered this device almost instantly and paired with it without inputting any codes . Once paired with the iPad , all audio which normally comes out of the iPad speaker plays through this system . Volume is then controlled by volume controls on this device and not the iPad . Sound quality is far superior to the iPads small speakers and matches or exceeds all portable battery powered speakers I 've listened to in its size range . Its small footprint complements the iPad and makes it an ideal traveling companion . It also pairs with my bluetooth cellphone and allows pairing to both my phone and iPad at the same time . So far , it exceeds my expectations and complements my iPad and cellphone perfectly . Additionally , I also use Apple 's wireless bluetooth keyboard with my iPad . The wireless keyboard and this device operate fine together without any disruption or interference to either device . Highly recommended .
5 #### Great product . Used them for years on all my vehicles . fast freight.good fit
1 #### Does n't fit the Garmin Vista Hcx . You are better off investing in a RAM mount than you are this time .
5 #### Bought these and they worked great with my Digitech delay , reverb , chorus and Jaman . No noticeable noise added to my ears . They continue to work to this day . They are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap . GOOD VALUE !
5 #### This fits the 2003 Ford focus with the Blaupankt MP3 / cd player . You MUST switch the 12v pos and Pos Ignition wire to the radio harness . other than that - was good to go . this kits even comes with 2 extra wire to plug in for what ever godies yoru new radio might need to have
5 #### I first started using it on the side windows of my CJ5 jeep and continue using it for any clear plastic that getting hazy , specially plastic headlight , , golfcart windshields .
1 #### I made the mistake of purchasing one of these at the AT&T store for a ridiculous price compared to Amazon . Perhaps for $ 10 it is worth having , but my cases has already worn away the color around the edges of the screen from playing games and using the phone . I have n't had it for much longer than a month and the wear started to show very quickly . Now instead of looking like a cool metallic case , it looks like a cheap while plastic case that was once painted a cool metallic color . Not good quality .
3 #### Great strings as far as sound goes but the coating starts wearing of after a couple of weeks of use .
5 #### I 've been buying Plantronics for almost 20 years , and always received an excellent product . Got a cheaper brand " LG " last time , and was very disappointed , and immediatly replaced it with the Plantronics 520 Voyager . It 's still reasonably priced , and an excellent value for the money . Do n't know why I just did n't get the 520 in the first place . The charger stand takes a bit of work to pry open before you can install the cord . But , it does a great job sitting on the table and holding the headset while charging . Need to find something like it for my car .
5 #### This stuff is great I used it to line the inside of a fiberglass racing fairing for my Gsxr . The glue acts like it bonds with the fiberglass the longer you let it sit the more attached it becomes . Super easy to work with too . You will need two sheets to line the inside of a race belly pan .
4 #### My friend gave me an accoustic guitar but the string is so hard it hurts my fingers doing adlibs . So i bought this to replace the string . The sound quality is good but still hurting my fingers . maybe not recommendable for accoustic guitars . Maybe i need to buy super slinky for electric guitars and use it for my accoustic guitar . But still good product .
4 #### Once the headset is paired with the phone , it is a good headset . I only give it four stars since it is difficult to get the headset paired with the phone . The clarity of the headset is very good . The controls on the headset are easy to use . I recommend buying it .
5 #### Product works amazing . Causes water to bead up and roll right off windshield . Also used it on my panaramic sunroof . Will advise to use a foam applicator that has a more dense foam or else you will waste product and have the entire foam pad soaked . Instructions say to apply , let set , and mist with water and wipe to remove but I dampened a microfiber cloth and buffed it off then went over with dry microfiber as the repellent instantly works and spraying with water bottle just caused water to roll off .
5 #### Exacty what I expected and wanted ! I am very picky when it comes to cell phones ... I do n't want flip phones , I do n't like full keyboard phones and I wanted a flat and compact phone with business applications and tools . For decades I am a convinced and happy Nokia user - It just never dissapoints when you know what you want !
2 #### These were great at first purchase , but they did not hold up very well . They were used only inside the home and handled carefully . One side speaker went and then a few months later , the other one stopped as well . They lasted less than one year . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY . We opted INSTEAD for PHILLIPS O'NEILL SHO9561/28 . These are extremely comfortable around your head , noise - reducing , fab sound .
5 #### Well mader , good looking and easy to install . Make your guitar look like art !
5 #### I'M USING IT AT WORK AND IT IS REALLY GOOD .
5 #### Have Elixir 's on all my acoustic guitars and mandolins . Love them .
5 #### With my incredible , I got the holster from Verizon that has a shell that wraps around the back of the phone , and the phone&shell slip into a belt - clip holster . I hesitated buying this because I liked this setup , but bought anyway . The holster still works ! The fingers that wrapped around the sides of the old shell now grip onto the extended battery cover . I 'd give it a non - scientific guess of 90 % as secure as it was with the shell . I do n't have any reference to allow me to compare to other extended life batteries . Repeating what others have said - it 's great having the battery life so that I can actually run apps without killing the battery . I turn it off at night , but get two days use out of it . It also helps protect the camera lens a little . Definately recommending to friends .
5 #### I bought these for a Dean Acoustical Bass . They look , feel , and sound great . They have a really warm smooth feel to them and are nice for finger plucking which is why I bought them . They totally eliminated the " fret noise " that I was getting from the round - wound strings that came on the bass .
5 #### I have been a radio buff and collector for many years and I have a large collection of radios . Dollar for dollar pound for pound this is one of the best buys out there . It is compact and great for travel or listening in bed . It has and excellent tuner on all bands . It has a suprisingly excellent sound from the built in speaker . It has full SW coverage with a 1kh tuning increment which is essential for serious DXers . It is functionally laid out well . Really could n't ask for more in a light weight compact multi - band . It far out performs the Sony SW35 and 40 and the Grundig YB300 and 400 which is in the same price range . Also , Radio Shack carried this radio under their name ( RS DX-399 ) and has recently held clearance sales where this little gem was selling at a great discount . If you see it buy it , its a must do !
5 #### Macro opens a whole new world to photographers . It gives a different and fresh set of challenges for any photographer . This lens is crisp and operates smoothly . Be sure to use a tripod or bean bag to keep your image stable . Personally I use a gorillapod to get the perfect distance . This is a fixed lens . You will not be able to zoom on a subject . Happy shooting !
2 #### I live in an appartment complex which is brick and I do n't get cell phone signals , so I did n't get much from this antenna from my appartment . I will try again outdoors and give another review at a latter date . Two stars for now not knowing how this works yet , nice concept if it works outdoors . Very portable .
5 #### I have my entire Tacoma covered in this stuff . Absolutely incredible
5 #### This is the best seven dollars you could ever spend . Sure , for just 20 more bucks you could get a card 1/8 the physical size of this one that has ONE THOUSAND TIMES of the capacity . . . but who needs that . Besides , I can use this little beauty in my Sony Cyber - Shot AND my Sony PSP ! ! Sure , those overpriced , high - capacity cards might work on virtually every consumer electronic device ever produced in the last decade , but can I use THEM to save my progress in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep once or possibly twice ? No way !
5 #### this is my second replacement . Keeping my power converter useful in working for over a decade
4 #### made life much easier . was n't bad on the install either
4 #### It 's a cable ! It 's closer to 6 feet long . No problems . Used it to connect modem to router . Success .
4 #### Simple , quick review . Real , thick , stiff leather . Heat it up some to make install easier . Good color ! Feels great , works well !
4 #### This unit comes with a standard 1157 bulb and I have up graded it to an LED bulb for a brighter light . Easy to install .
5 #### Simple and easy to use , everything expected for a good price .
5 #### Fit the phone however the phone was water damaged that I was Un aware of
5 #### This cleaner tape contains a small bottle of cleaner fluid in a compartment on the tape itself . Pour a few drops of the fluid into a yellow plastic hole on the top of the cleaner tape and then run it through the vcr and it will automatically stop when finished . I did n't think the fluid got the paper tape wet enough frankly but you can use as much as you need I suppose . This is really a must have for anyone that still uses a vcr because it 's so cumbersome to try to clean the head with other objects .
5 #### My son is a first year student and seems to go through reeds like candy . These are a good quality at a great price . Highly recommended . I have been an active member of Amazon for quite some time and myself rely heavily on reviews provided by others when making a decision as to whether or not to purchase an item -- whether that purchase be one that I am making through Amazon or another source ( such as a local store ) ; therefore , I am very aware of the value of user feedback and do my best to assist others in making a quality decision by providing quality feedback . Was this review helpful to you ? If so , I would very much appreciate it if you would rate this review accordingly . Many thanks !
1 #### After reading all the reviews it appeared this was a very good headset except for the oversized part that fits in your ear . Since I am a big guy I figured this would not be a problem for me . I was wrong . It will not stay on your ear ( keeps falling off when I bend over or chew ) and it will not fit in my ear properly either . On top of that I had many complaints from callers on the other end about call clarity and having a hard time hearing me . I have tried many bluetooth headsets and have finally found one that fits good , easy to wear , and I have had no complaints from callers . In fact when I asked some people they said I did n't sound like I was in a well and echoing like in the past . The headset I ended up with is the Plantronics Windsmart Voyager 510 ( $ 40 at Amazon ) . I hope this is helpful to some of you .
5 #### This is a boss case . It 's an official Nook case and clips in very nicely . There is a back button to turn off the device with ease . The magnet catch is great . If you do n't want the flap open . the magnet hold it back in place so you can read it with one hand . Durable and soft to the touch . The inside is white which may get dirty but cleaning in a breeze .
5 #### I remember when most picks were a neutral color . These came in my granddaughter 's favorite color and match her pink guitar .
5 #### I absolutely love this phone . Wifi , edge , great sound quality , beautiful screen . Windows mobile 5 has been great so far . The wifi works great with my wireless network . When I 'm not at home - EDGE is great for surfing . It syncs perfectly with my WinXP computer so all my emails , tasks , appointments and contacts are always in sync over the air with my Exchange server . I have tons of movies , MP3 's , my bible , and a complete dictionary on my 1 gb mini - sd card . I bought a ThinkOutside BT keyboard and it works great with this phone . I 'm with Tmo in the Northwest and my reception is much better than with my other cell . I honestly think it 's the best smartphone from any manufacturer or carrier and believe me - I did my research . Great phone / PDA !
5 #### This is the best clip I have ever owned for a phone . I love the magnectic closure , makes it SO much easier to get the phone in and out . I do n't wear my phone all the time , but when I am I hardly notice the clip at all . It does what it is supposed to do ( hold the phone ) , and gets out of my way . I love it .
5 #### I have also polished barrels and feed ramps . This does a great job , either applied by hand , or with a felt wheel on a Dremel .
5 #### Do n't waste money on the cheaper knock - offs . If you want a crisp , well defined pencil beam ... these are the off road lights you want to buy .
5 #### I used this on my 1995 Acura Integra ( B18B1 engine ) . My only complaint is that it fit rather loosely in my crank pulley and kept falling out as I was setting up my wrench to pop out the bolt . But I still gave it 5 stars because I could n't imagine getting that crank pulley off any other way . The Helms service manual calls for a very similar tool that I 'm sure is only available to Honda / Acura dealerships . I do n't like buying tools that serve only one purpose , but the $ 25 or so I spent on this was well worth it .
5 #### These were maybe a bit tinny at first , but eventually they sound fine . I am a believer , since regular strings deteriorate quickly for me .
4 #### Truth be told , I 'm not a drummer . I play guitar . However , this stool works just fine for me . It 's got multiple height settings , nice , sturdy feet , and it does n't move around / slip . The seat is n't the most comfortable seat to sit on for hours and hours , but for an hour or two , it 's just fine . I have n't had any problems with it , and would probably have given it 5 stars if the seat were just a bit more comfortable .
5 #### thank you for offering the extra long iphone cord my granddaughter will love it to help her while she is doing her on - line college homework
5 #### This worked flawlessly with a Powerline adapter then splitting out the connection to a PS3 , Logitech Revue and Mini - Mac . None of the downstream components had any issues receiving or sending data through this device . Highly recommended for a cost effective solution outside of using Wireless
3 #### I bought this phone 3 months ago for 60 $ and have been using it since . The screen and battery are probably the best part of this phone . he youtube videos look very crisp and i seriously feel like the scree almost has depth to it . It lasts the whole day while texting , using 3 G and phone calls , so it gets an A in the battery depertment . In terms of functionailty , there are some major issues . The camera frequently freezes when changing between modes and sometimes it just freezes for no reason . I know they just released a android 2.3 update , but I ca nt get it to download on my phone properly . If i paid retail for this phone , I would be more unhappy , but I got it for so cheap . Ill get a new phone as soon as my next 2 year upgrade comes along .
5 #### I like it - it 's nice and sturdy . It 's pretty big and heavy , so my super - junk mic stand does n't work very well with this , but the pop filter is just perfect . I only bought it to help me keep a constant distance from the mic , and since it was so cheap , I did n't expect the popfilter to actually WORK as well as this does . But I can even record myself whistling no problem . I 've never tried a more expensive one , but this seems like it works perfectly !
5 #### Sticks are fantastic . Great value , straight and durable . Have only broken one so far versus the Vic Firths I bought which broke much quicker . I received no random colors . All look are uniform in size , shape , weight and balance . Will DEFINITELY buy again .
4 #### did n't work as nice as I thought but overall nice for the price .
5 #### Worked well , attached firmly to the smaller 1.8 " drive . I 'd like to have found a solid external case for the drive but for information retrieval this worked great . I plugged it into an adapter SATA to USB and it worked like a charm .
5 #### I just bought this bag and I 've stuffed my Minolta Dimage 7i and my Pentax * istDL in it , plus my 70 - 300 mm lens and a bunch of accessories for both cameras . It keeps the weather out too ! I just had it out in a rain storm and everything stayed perfectly dry !
5 #### I Do n't have 21 words to say about this ! I like it and it all worked as it should . great !
5 #### Got here fast , quality for the price . Quieter than my flowmaster , but smooth and good sounding .
5 #### Easy connection to factory harness . All the wires are clearly identified for easy hookup to any aftermarket stereo . Made for a quick installation with no problems . I slipped heat shrink tubing over the wires before soldering them to the stereo wires , then slipped the shrink up around the connections and sealed them up . Very nice looking , neat installation .
1 #### I bought two of these binoculars and both have double vision right out of the box . I have always thought that Bushnell had good quality products . Nowadays it 's hard to get good quality stuff especially when everything is made from the same factory in China . I will not buy Bushnell binoculars again .
4 #### It 's a good phone . I bought it for my wife to replace and old E62 I could just upgrade your operating system using a PC . As a Mac user I can sync contacts and calendars with iSync without any problems via Bluetooth Sometimes the Nokia 's own calendar , duplicate events with different dates . I think it is a software problem I could never prove the characteristics of the GPS because it takes too long to take satellites . For the rest , everything is more than good .
5 #### Love the feel of these picks . Much better than Fender style mediums .
5 #### Easy install , literally plug and play . The " pencil beams " are like bright laser pointers . Easily illuminates half a mile or more .
4 #### When I purchased these , I did n't realize they were actually mirrored . We put the first one on , and it surprised the heck out of us . The only problem is that with it being as shiny as it is , it 's hard to get it completely flat against the screen . When the phone is used , the backlight has no problem coming through the film . I would recommend this .
5 #### This thing is great ! I totally eliminated the banging ! Just buy it !
5 #### I cut these to fit my 99 suburban and they worked great .
5 #### Great hi Speed cable at a great price that i buy in advance for when i need them . Works as expected . good shipping
5 #### I 've been in the broadcasting business for over 15 years and these are the best headphones I 've ever used . It took some convincing to invest in them , since I usually bought cheaper headphones . But the cheap ones last a few months , and the Sony MDR - V6s last years . You wo n't be sorry with this headphones !
5 #### Used to use earnie ball super slinkys back in the seventy 's . They were great strings . Very easy on the fingers . I thought I would try the picks . They do the job .
1 #### I gave it to my son , I have a smaller canon bag which I like better than 1EG , my son thinks it is a really good bag
5 #### I did n't realize there was such a thing as an oil pump until I decided in August that I would winterize my wakeboard boat with an inboard Indmar engine . Of course , there is no hole in the bottom of the boat so how do I drain the oil . Well , I considered this Hydro - Turf product along with 2 - 3 more expensive brands and gambled on this one since I would only use it once a year . Well , this pump worked so well , that I used it on my Yamaha jet ski and my Yamaha ATV . Using it on the ATV saved the need to remove the shield under the engine . Admittedly , the pump is very slow , but they all are since the hose must fit , in most cases , down the dip stick shaft . Highly recommended product . Also , I was able to drain ALL the 5 + quarts of oil from the Indmar engine with one extraction cycle .
5 #### I 've been using this type grip for about 6 years , it 's not expensive leather but I like the way it feels . Installation is easy just take it slow and use a hair dryer to get a little stretch , if you try to muscle it you will tear it . Very good value .
5 #### My favorite strings for PRS and Fender scale guitars . Sound of 10 's with the feel of 9 's . Never broken a 9.5 yet .
2 #### I did n't like the sound on plastic beaters .. also it 's a pain to take off make sure you got goo gone or something ...
5 #### Love this product it is the exact right size you you have a VW bus with a front mounted spare tire . I am running Hankook RA08 185r14 tires on the correct stock rim and this size L tire cover is the exact fit you will need .
5 #### this item was alright . but the bolts was about a half inch to short . so I have to go and get me longer bolts .
5 #### Great replacements . I use Squier guitars for shows , so if they are damaged or stolen I am not out a $ 1600 Fender . I installed these pickups in to a Classic Vibe Thinline Telecaster . Now it sounds as good as it looks ! Typical Telecaster tones even with light strings . The pickups made a $ 400 guitar sound like a $ 2400 Fender Thinline . Highly recommend !
5 #### It 's a little wobbly on carpet , and the clutch chain on mine seems to be at a slightly strange angle . But it works so what the heck .
5 #### I have packed bearings by hand since the first time I had to replace a bearing . Since then , most cars have gone to hub assemblies ( boo ) . I finally got my car back and with this tool packed the inner and outer bearings in the time it would take me to pack one by hand . Not to mention the lack of a mess to clean up . Very nice .
4 #### Should have read a little closer . I thought this was a true 1 step with a wax or sealant in the product but that is not the case . So unfortunately I had to go around the Rv again with a sealant . Product works great but I would buy Mckees all in one since it has a wax built into the product .
5 #### Fit great and the price was better than in the local stores .
5 #### Excellent strings ! Great price . I bought a used guitar - thought it sounded crappy - put these strings on and now its my favorite axe .
5 #### I 've been a fan of Kyser capos for sometime -- Particularly the design and ease of use . It came as ordered , and on time . I really love Amazon prime shipping !
5 #### Simply Amazing ! Great field of view and easy focus . Best binoculars I have ever used . I have used regular 18x50 binoculars in the past and always found it challenging to hold the image steady watching sporting events . The stabilization feature is terrific . The rock solid image is definitely worth the cost .
4 #### It is Small Compac and this job I am very happy with it and I will use it a lot thanks Amazon this is just what I 've been waiting for
5 #### Better than a wire cutter as the blades are rounded so as not to poke the guitar . Sharp and great leverage so it cuts easily . The tuning key part fits nicely and hangs on as you turn much better than flimsily cheap plastic ones . The works well and is an excellent value . Make a good stocking stuffer too for the holidays for a guitar player . I am very happy with it .
5 #### Blackberry unit functioned beautifully . I charged it , set basic options then repackaged it for mailing . Big , bright screen . Ball and keyboard easy to operate . Absolutely love it .
3 #### The Koss PortaPro Headphones are extraordinarily portable , as they fold and slide into an small extremely space . However , they NEVER retain the tension setting or head band size that you set for best fit between uses ( even when not folded ) due to design limitations . They also tend to become uncomfortable to wear after a short period of time at any setting . If you do NOT need portability as your overriding choice factor , you can do MUCH better with other Koss headphone models or other top rated brands ... so keep looking .
5 #### everything was as listed and is in use all appear to be in good working order
3 #### I 'm writing this review at the urging of Amazon . Com , but it 's really a bit early . I bought a couple of Maxell VP100 Dry Video Head Cleaners because I planned to copy a lot of old VHS tapes to DVD on my new VCR / DVD recorder . I 've successfully used it about five times total on three VCRs . In the last attempts , when I inserted the cartridge , it immediately started rewinding , and I had to stop it and hit play . It does n't always play . This has happened on two VCRs . So ... the jury 's still out on this product . I think I 'm supposed to get about 100 uses . I 'll come back and edit my review if I have any new information .
1 #### I bought four of these for myself and friends and noone noticed a positive difference . It was a waste of money , my DROID x2 worked better without it .
5 #### I bought these specifically to use with my drum pad . I love them
5 #### This review is of Ernie Balls Super Slinky strings for electric guitar . The gauges are : 9 , 11 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 42 . The G ( gauge 16 ) is single - strand nickel - plated steel , like the B and top E , so light and bendable . I play a Fender Strat for which these Super Slinky strings are near - perfect : they 're easy to fit , the top strings bend well without much left - hand effort and they 're great for playing power chords . A good tip is to use a light , bendy plectrum , which is pretty much essential for the top E ( gauge 9 ) . One caution : these strings are very stretchy and take a few hours to bed in during which they go out of tune easily , especially the top two , so best not to fit them immediately prior to a performance . Also if you 're an aggressive player you may occasionally snap one of the top three , so keep spares .
1 #### Um .. wow . Garbage , crap . They are flimsy , made out of the cheapest material available . ALL plastic . VERY breakable . Sound sucks . Does n't cover your entire ear . Uncomfortable . Flimsy . Today I found a FAR better pair of headphones on CRAIGSLIST for only $ 10 - and they were right around the corner . SENNHEISER HD-202 < -- I suggest going that route instead , much better bang for your buck . What happened to the days of nice , full sound and luxurious cushions that cover the WHOLE ear ( and then some ! ! ) with cushions on the head band , hm ? You 'll find the SENNHEISER brand HD 202 is much better built ( cushions and all ) .
4 #### Would love to give it 5 stars , but the ONE and only thing missing from this is that the charging indicator light does n't work . The biggest positive about this is that the connection to the Nook itself , is MUCH more " beefy " than the standard Nook charging cable . B&N should have to supply each and every Nook owner with one of these free of cost due to their incredibly poor design of the standard cable that comes with the unit itself . This is at least the fourth charger cable we have bought and I am hoping that it is the last .
5 #### Had my laptop going through a PA system and this hum x device got rid of the humming . Highly recommend it
4 #### Product not readily available in most stores . Shipped as ordered and promised . It is what it is , and works as oil should
5 #### I bought the easy to use aerosol recharger kit . Cleaner works well too . Easy , simple , save time and hassle . Great product .
4 #### bought this product thinking it uses the micro usb , but it does not , uses s-20 pin for samsung . the item looks real nice and seems to be real sturdy .
5 #### Absolutely a must have . One of the biggest problems I have in my truck was the location of the auxiliary lighter . With this device I can now place everything I need right next to me , definitely a nice addition . One of the biggest problems
5 #### You can go wrong with the Shubb brand . Made to last a lifetime . Parts made in USA and China , inspected and assembled in the USA .
2 #### This pedal does n't boost the sound , My guitar sounds louder when I 'm playing on the clean channel , rather than with this pedal with full volume and distortion . Also I notice not that much difference between a good Overdrive from a Marshall Amp compared to this distortion in a general sense , but greater sound of the Marshall Overdrive .
4 #### I bought these headphones for my husband . I was looking for ones with good and detailed enough reviews but still affordable for my budget . Due to his business , he travels pretty frequent and the noise from the surroundings in a plane , especially in very long flights , sometimes can be very disturbing . These do n't cancel noise 100 % while no plaing ( Zvideo or music ) but they do pretty good while playing ; he can listen pleasantly his music ( very good base ) , concentrate better to read or work and even help him to rest some . They fold nice to carry 'em , they look nice . He finds them still comfortable after more than 6 months using them , they do n't hurt or bother him when he falls asleep ; we were surprised of how long the cable is , but that helps they do n't pull when he moves . He always take 'em with him , he really likes 'em . The only reason i do n't give the 5 stars is because not 100 % noise - cancelling so they are not excellent , but they are very good .
5 #### This is the best product for rag tops I have ever used . Prevents fading significantly and long term effects . Well worth the extra expense .
5 #### Love these strings in every gage . Last forever when wiped down after playing ( as all strings should ) . These are all I 'll buy for my acoustics .
1 #### Leather on one side will bunch up , until you realize the number of lacing holes is not the same on each side . I spent hours trying to get this to install without the leather bunching up on the front . All was in vain until I counted the stitching holes and found about 10 extra holes on one side . This made a big difference between the stiches length , which led to the excess material .
5 #### Beautiful , quick , and my god do they sound / look good . 5 Star ! Beautiful , quick , and my god do they sound / look good . 5 Star !
5 #### Prompt delivery , good quality product ; Would buy again ! Thank you .
1 #### I had a leak that completely emptied my AC in 48hrs . I never detected any of this dye coming out of the system . I replaced the seals on the back of the compressor and all the O - rings . This stopped the leak . These parts cost only about $ 14 , so you 're better off just replacing all the seals if you have a leak . If one seal is leaking , all of them are close to failing . If that does n't work , then the compressor is leaking internally .
5 #### Amazing crisp white output with a very very small hint of blue . I love it .
4 #### The pens were a great price and made using my phone and tablet much easier . They are very light weight and very convenient .
5 #### These have a nice snap to them which is great for picking , but still produce a nice smooth strum . They grip better then celluloid but do n't hang onto the strings for dear life like the thicker Tortex 's can do on an acoustic .
5 #### Just what I was looking for . Very happy and the price was right !
5 #### I love this cover ! Fits my evo 4 g perfectly . Made strong i ve had it for over 2 months and none of the bling has come off . I do n't put it in my pocket or anything because i m afraid that will make them come off but i like it !
5 #### Easy one person cable tie for attaching vines like trumpet and wisteria to arbors . Simple to connect two or more together for wide spots and lasts several seasons in harsh sunlight .
4 #### This is good because of the adjustable holder ( the rubber tip is a nice improvement ) but it loses a star because it does n't have a good border around it .
2 #### This case worked like a usual case . But on the rare occasion I had to take it off , it kept chipping the corner of my phone . Then , the corner of the case broke off and it was rendered useless anymore . Wo n't be buying a snap on case anymore .
5 #### I think I 've built five bicycle wheels now with this stuff -- 180 happy spokes . After a bad experience with a bike - specific spoke prep , I 'm convinced this is the better product .
3 #### held good charge and would charge my phone 2 full cycles , however after 3 months and outside of the return period , it died ...
5 #### Sounds beautiful . Scrape off the Squier logo and your friends wo n't hear the difference . Unless they 're super snobby . SAVE YO MONAY , KIDDOS .
4 #### Wires are as good as the connections they make . This cable works fine and is doing the job it is designed to do .
5 #### Much cheaper this way - prompt and reasonable shipping . Works well and I 've ordered some for gifts of other RAZR3 owners .
5 #### I found this rosin through a recommendation from Fiddlerman ( excellent site , BTW ) . I prefer dark rosin to light , especially for synthetic core or gut strings . This is good rosin , particularly for general use , and it 's become my default rosin . It applies easy and I did n't get a ton of dust after a playing session . It 's softer and stickier than the light rosin I was using , and I think that really helped me with a different , more complex tone . Or it could be my imagination . Either way , I really like this rosin a lot .
5 #### I put these 2 link chains on the front tires of my ranger . I put 4 " wheel spacers on for clearance .. I have chains on front and back . They do ride better than 4 link chains that is why I put them on the front . The machine goes thru snow over the clearance for short distances . I use my machine to get to the fish house here in Minnesota . It extended my season with the ability to get out on the lake with heavy drifting . I never got stuck when trucks were shoveling themselves out .
1 #### I worked a decade in the technology field , including as a purchasing agent , so I know my parts . I also developed caviar taste and a willingness to pay extra for quality , which is why I buy Belkin snagless cables . I wish I 'd seen the comments here before I placed my order -- or trusted my instincts that no one could sell Belkins at this price . What I received was , as others have said , clearly NOT Belkin . It was just a cheap , knockoff cable of the sort I could make myself if I was in a bind and really needed to . The cable arrived in a laughably big box , shipped via Fed Ex . I guess you can afford to ship so inefficiently when you 're ripping people off . I contacted Parts Express and demanded a return , and I was told I 'd get a shipping label immediately -- though why they 'd spend the money on a return for such a piece of junk defies logic . So far , I 've not received one , so I 've turned the matter over to Amazon . Buyer beware ...
5 #### I have to say this is my first investment in an external drive - the best ! ! Compact , simple to operate , works just fine with my laptop and desktop - especially when burning / ripping a disk from an internal drive in a cpu to a blank disc .
5 #### I bought this to do ' finger tight ' tensions on my snare and toms . It 's much easier to use this than trying to finger tension the tuning rods themselves .
5 #### Barely a drop in each pot and they immediately became smooth and clear . My 20 + year old Les Paul was at the point the tone knobs started to have little effect on the sound and the volume knobs were crunchy with static . This stuff made the thing sound brand new , major difference in the impact the tone knobs have on the sound , and silent operation on the volume knobs , no more crackle or static . The knobs also turn smoother and easier than ever . If you have an aging guitar with dirty / crackly sounding pots , this is what you need . Do n't get the other types that will dry them out - this one is specifically formulated to leave the right amount of lubrication behind . As little as it took to do the job , i can imagine this can is like a 100 - year supply !
5 #### These are my go - to strings for my acoustic . Love , love , love !
5 #### They 're screws .... they screw into stuff , hold on to other stuff . Exactly what you 'd expect .
4 #### Basically needed a longer cord for my USB hub . The stock cable that came with it was SO short . Did n't want to spend a ton of $ $ but still needed something with good connectors and decent speed . This did the job without breaking the bank . Would recommend !
5 #### I bought a pair of these for keeping in touch with friends during group trips . If you do n't need any fancy features , and just need a decent walkie talkie , this is it . The signal is clear and the unit is small . It fits nicely in your hands , and the buttons are ergonomically placed . Each unit requires 3 AAA batteries . I think most people who buy walkie talkies use them as a simple and cheap way to keep in touch with others within a close range . I think the KXTR320F FRS does the job well . If you need something more powerful , get a cell phone .
5 #### word great very good price nothing bad what so ever thanks for having it here haha must buy if u need iy
5 #### Being my first digital camera , maybe it 's easy to wow me , but I really like this camera . Picture quality is very nice , and the camera itself is easy to use . My only gripe is the battery cover . Because of where it is and the direction it slides ( and the fact that the batteries are literally spring - loaded projectiles ) , it 's really easy to bump or grab the camera so that the battery compartment springs open , spilling the batteries and requiring you to re - enter the time and date ( if you do ) . Many times I 've pulled the camera out , only to fumble with getting the batteries back into it . Other than that , I love it ! Oh , and I 'd recommend getting a USB reader for the memory . I did n't think that waiting for the serial download would be that big of a deal , but it gets irksome . A larger memory card would be a long wait .
5 #### My girlfriend used to play piano , but we do n't have room for one in our apartment , so I bought her the Yamaha P115 88 - key Digital Piano and FC4A Piano Sustain Foot Pedal . Set them both up in our bedroom and the result is amazing . The resistance on the keys is great , it feels like a real piano , and it 's small enough to fit next to our bed in our fairly small bedroom with no issues . Audio quality out of the built - in speakers is pretty good , but of course we could always hook it up to a better sound output if we wanted . It was a little pricy , but it 's worth it if you need a piano in a small space .
2 #### I HAVE to have this before the wknd . Taking sick parent out of town to a hospital ! ! Where is it ?
5 #### Works great ! Needed a replacement for my old charger . Not cheap and charges my phone very fast ! I love it !
4 #### Fair quality . I doubt IT IS OEM . Only worked for three weeks and then died .
4 #### The battery somehow does n't strike to me as a " brand new " item due to the fact the it does n't last more than 2 days according to my dad ( I bought it for ) , and he merely use the phone at all . So , in conclusion , it is better than another one I bought for him a little while ago which died almost as fast as the old original battery came with the phone , but I did expect a little more this time .
5 #### Gets the job done . Needed these for backup on tour .
5 #### Great product . Keeps water and dirt from getting into my connectors .
5 #### It 's pretty great . Perfect size with an actual conga sound . Obviously it 's a mini , its for mini jams , with other mini instruments , because the sound does not carry very well at all . That 's to be expected and not a complaint ! Still love it .
4 #### It looks awesome but did n't like to stay snapped together . It was a good case but i could be made better .
4 #### Works great for what it is . A good choice , just remember to get a stand .
5 #### A little does go a long way ( 2 oz per mid size car ) and you should start with a clean car so you do n't " seal " the dirt and grim in .
5 #### The harness mated to a 2008 Ford Ranger 's plug perfectly . Using several small wire - nuts , I was easily able to connect this harness to one that came with a Sony radio that I put into the truck . This plugged into the truck 's wiring , the other plugged into the radio . Tidy it up with some zip - ties and a new face plate adapter , and the install took about an hour , start to finish .
1 #### This does n't work for the exhaust because it has rubber and it burns .
4 #### I have used many types of bluetooth devices , in hopes of finding the one that works great & feels great . While this is the best working and sounding bluetooth I have ever owned , I struggle with the pain left in my ear . I am unable to wear if for long periods of time , even though it came with 6 - different ear pieces , none provide the comfort I find with , say , a Motorolla H710 , H715 , H721 . While the Motorolla is extremely comfortable , it has a short life span , where it gives up the ghost in less than 8 - months of usage . I am told the Jabra ear gels fit most Jawbone BT headsets & feel much more comfortable , but causes the BT to protrude from the ear too much . I have not tryed them yet because the reviews are not very convincing or impressive . I like the Jawbone Prime BT enough to hold out for a confortable ear gel , or till my ear becomes immune to the pain . The main advantage of the Jawbone , is that it is trully a background noise suppressor , while boasting the best looking BT on the market . However , I think I will purchase a backup Motorolla 721 , or whatever latest modes comes out next , for times where I do n't need noise suppression , but anticipate extended periods of wear / usage . I would have given this item a 5 - star , if it was more comfortable .
5 #### Same great stuff I used to get in japan when shooting film . Fine grain , great color , and really forgiving . Ordered it along with a Canon Film rebel on here . Edit : I too received generic Fuji instead of the HQ , nonetheless still great film just a heads up . Not near to expiration like some people said they got . Mines good till 2014/03
5 #### I bought this to be able to control audio volume . Similar devices of other brands / no brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated ; Koss is built much better and so far so good . No complaints .
5 #### As I was unpackaging the product , I was already pleased by it . The construction was very well and felt of very high quality . The battery charger was not as heavy as I would have imagined and I knew it would not be a problem to carry around . What was also a plus side on convenience was that I would still be able to use my original phone holsters and cases which I saw may become a problem with using one of those rechargeable cases . This charger holds a good amount of juice and in one instance I was able to not only charge my phone but another persons as well with the charger still having some energy left for another phone to be charged , not to mention it seems to charge just as fast as using a wall charger . This charger also has the features of a red laser pointer , which is great for presentations and an LED light which always comes in handy . I do however , wish that there were separate buttons or switches for these lights and that It would be not shared with the button to turn on the charger for actual charging . The holding down of the button to go through the different features can get a bit annoying when I am just trying to charge my phone . Overall , I give this product a 5/5 rating . It works GREAT , holds lots of energy for charging , charges very fast and is very well constructed .
5 #### Smaller than I was imagining , but is actually the perfect size . High quality device that works flawlessly . The weight is more than I expected and my hand starts to cramp , but I expect this will go away with practice . You can use other low - cost / quality options , but its worth the extra cost to invest in quality .
4 #### The New Trent iTorch is the smallest and lightest 5200mah external battery pack you will find anywhere . It feels sturdy and solidly built . This is a must have for anyone who finds themselves needing to charge their phone all the time . I hate walking out the door with 40 % left of battery life on my iPhone5 and having to not use my phone like I would like to in order to save battery . Now I can use my phone when and where I want without worrying about the battery dying . The only issue I have is the battery pack might not store as much juice as advertised . I get about 1 full charge on my iPhone5 - it is advertised to provide 2 - 3 full charges . I do n't see that happening ever ! But this is still light , compact and easy to carry around all day in your pocket just in case you need some added power to your phone or other device .
5 #### Worked great for my 4wheeler addition through the storage uniton the front .
4 #### The cord is too long ( should be changeable ) . At first I gave it a negative review because the volume was n't controlled smoothly and did n't go all the way off , but I think the problems I was having may have been due to some of the other adapters I was using . I removed these , and it 's working perfectly now . I also opened it up and cleaned up some messy glue inside . Could have been that that fixed it . But I think it was the other adapters that were interfering . Biggest weakness is the built in cord that ca n't be changed to a cord of the length I need .
5 #### These will last you 6 months to a year depending on how frequently you move your equipment . and what kind of idiots get their hands on your mics .
4 #### i just received a second unit . It does not work . I checked the fuse and connections . Still does not work in car . Others that I have work perfectly .
5 #### Worked outstanding to remove the fading of the finish of my 20 ' speed boat . When a boat gets that bad you need a great product . You have to work hard when you let it get bad so be prepared but the results are wonderful .
5 #### Heavy duty strap . This strap is very comfortable as well .
5 #### This product works great for my kia soul ! I recommend this product .
5 #### Simply put that Lowepro makes great camera bags . A great attention to detail seems to be in every bag that Lowepro makes . This well padded unit holds my Nikon digital SLR , an extra lens , filters , a battery , charger , memory cards , a lens hood and a mini tripod . I have three Lowepro bags and would n't hesitate to buy more .
5 #### I 've tried a bunch of different cleaners for the oxidized head lights of my car . NONE worked as good as this stuff . No buffer needed ! Makes a world of difference in being able to see the road ahead of you . Highly recommend !
5 #### Looks great in my Chevelle Easy to fit Only down size is the back has a cut out for the bulb which lets it down when viewed through the windscreen
1 #### This is not a criticism of the actual item . I 've tried ordering 2 times and there must be some problem with the stock at amazon provided by accessory one . Both times I did not receive the wall charger and only got the cable . I called Amazon and the said they could not provide just the wall adapter and I would need to return it and reorder . I did , and again received just the cable . Again I called , set up a return and was told by amazon that they would suspend ordering of the item ( that never happened and it is still available ) I love amazon.com , but will get this item elsewhere .
5 #### It 's a fantastic cable ! The kill switch works flawlessly . It 's very rugged , yet flexible .
1 #### I 've been buying the Mophie Juice Pack Air since 2009 and I 've had three of them break so far . They all break at the same place : the USB port . Apparently they did n't put any glue on the USB port and it 's just barely hanging in there , after a 3 - 12 months it will always break . There 's a Youtube video that shows how to take apart the mophie so it should be easy to open and glue yourself . I have two more Mophie cases on the way , I will take these apart and glue them before I start using them .
5 #### Great fit plover it wow just what I order every tithing . Ship great on time fits on my kindle fire fits my x treme . And my sons android
5 #### Great for a 2015 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite . I did the paracord mod , and it turned out great . Simply cut the plastic cords attached , discard and use whatever color paracord you like in its place , I used black . Make sure to remove the inner strands of the paracord before wrapping !
5 #### Very fine glitter , super easy to use , bright brilliant colors . Super happy with these .
4 #### Needed to make 200 handouts , so ordered two packs . Unfortunately , each pack was short by a few pieces , so I had to run to the store to pick up some overpriced sheets to finish my project . Other than running short , I like these sheets for their clarity , and weight . They do n't distort the text underneath , and the thickness helps keep them from accidental folds or nicks , making the presentation materials nice and crisp .
5 #### these things are cheap , but they work great for simple projects . not super worried about them . great for the price
5 #### Nice stylist product . I am using it with my Treo 700P. Crystal clear sound quality and different volument levels that suit me ( use hearing aids ) . Long lasting battery time . I charge it on the weekends only . Cons : occasional loss of bluetooth communication between phone and headset .
1 #### It 's not even enough to charge the HTC One , My phone always display " Charging Slow "
5 #### I was changing my factory battery 2 times a day I seen this powerbear battery thought I would give it a try and I have to say I love it at the end of the day I still going with battery life thx so much u all saved from buying a new phone
5 #### Thee best drum - key I 've ever owned ! ! Hands down ! ! ! Yes , it costs a bit more than others BUT it is a heavy duty drum key . It sits perfect with the rest of my keys and the best part is you 're able to detach the the drum key from the rest without having to haul the rest of the keys .
5 #### Slap one of these babies on your buffer and go to town . They do n't spin off , they 're easy to clean , and they make for a nice mirror finish .
1 #### We bought these headphones , trusting the Panasonic name and the great reviews but are very disappointed . We bought these to replace another , nicer set of Panasonic headphones that had stopped working on one side . Our boys use them for the long car rides we often have during summer and holiday travel but they used them for the first time the other day and they were so quiet they could n't hear over the noise of the car which was n't loud . I thought the kids had some settings messed up in their tablets or there was some hidden volume control on the headphones that would fix the problem but I was wrong ... they 're just wicked quiet ! Unfortunately , at this price , it is n't even worth the hassle to send them back .
1 #### These cases are not suitable to replace broken clear jewel cases because there 's an area of ridges along the left side that obscures the artwork , and the tray where the CD sits is made of frosted plastic , which also obscures the artwork . The jewel cases I received are not the same as those pictured in the Amazon listing . They are also made of very thin plastic and feel flimsy . They definitely are n't " ... superior in quality , manufactured and designed to exceed the industry standards , " as the Amazon listing states .
5 #### Love these strings . They make my mando sound so clear and the sound rings so beautifully .
5 #### I 've used the Tortex picks for a while now , and have been really happy with them . This pick however , takes it to the next level . Very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick . I use the .73 for acoustic and the same holds true . Great product .
5 #### I always played with the brown colored 351s growing up , but I love the blue finish on these . I 'd recommend the 351 Fender picks over any others personally but I 'm very partial to blue as well , so these are perfect .
5 #### All of the reviews that I 've read about the Roland KC 550 have been very positive . With that said , I purchased this amp to use with my Korg Kronos 88 ( another amazing piece of equipment ) . Up until this weekend I used the amp primarily in small to medium coffee houses . This weekend we played a benefit gig in a large tent ( I 'm guessing the tent was about 125 ' x 250 ' ) . We have a six piece band , and I used only the KC 550 to amplify my Kronos . The volume was set to under 1/2 volume , and my Kronos was crystal clear and louder that you could imagine . There was not one point in the evening that my keyboads were over powered by anyone . The sound blended perfectly , and when it was time to solo I increased the volume about 15 % on the Kronos and my keyboards were sharp , consise , and clear . This is the best keyboard amp that I have ever played through . You will not be disappointed .
5 #### This pop screen really works , thanks to its double - layered configuration . My only complaint is that the item shipped to me had a " run " in one side of the screen , but this was too inconsequential for me to return it .
5 #### I like the sound and sensitivity these heads produce for the snare side of my snare drum . A work of caution though , like all snare resonant heads , these are very thin ! They must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required . But you must be careful . I tore a small hole in one of mine with the snare wires because the end of the snare wires were too close to the bearing edge . Not Remo 's fault but it is something to pay attention to .
2 #### thank you very much for the product is much to my liking , thanks .
5 #### The Auto Ventshade 25902 Bugflector II Hood Shield looks great in the pickup hood . Was easy to install . T Y
3 #### My son only gave these 3 stars because the do n't screw on the stand they just sit in place .
2 #### I purchased 2 . The left side worked OK . The right did not fit as advertised . I would not recommend
5 #### I bought this drive for my G3 Macintosh . Had it installed , initialized and had everything transfered from the original 4 GB drive in about 45 minutes . ( Why Maxtor says you need a Windows clone is beyond me ; the drive works perfectly with the Apple driver and does n't have the limititation some early Windows versions have for paritiion sizes ) . The drive is quiet and fast . Everything I expected and more : the specs on the box looked like the specs for the ATA 100 model , even though it was supposed to be ATA 66 . Sure enough , the drive inside the box is the " H " model -- the ATA 100 version . I am completely satisfied , and will probably buy a second as a slave drive eventually .
4 #### I received an 8 gauge fuse holder , the company promptly sent out another fuse holder . It turned out to be an 8 gauge as well . I made it work for a polarity reversal between my Renogy suitcase solar panel and my Zamp connection on my camper . Better a heavier gauge than a thinner .
5 #### These strings have a really nice tone and feel . What more could you ask for ? Can get about 3 gigs out of a set about 12 playing hours .
5 #### Mogami makes a nice cable ! Very nice Nuetrik plugs , Fit well and is in the length I wanted . Wrecked my last cable when I dove off the stage . I 'm ok but that old cable sure is n't ! Now that I 'm retired I have more time for touring but maybe I should re - think the stage antics .. Maybe I need to go wireless ..... Have a great day !
3 #### I like this style unit , it is comfortable , be nice if the behind the ear piece could be smaller . The reason for no 5 stars is the battery started crapping out quickly . I would charge it overnight and grab on my way to work , sometimes a 15 minute call would kill the battery . It also would switch off on sometimes , like during my call it would click over to the phone then back to the earpiece . Which is a total pain when your talking to a client while driving . I may buy an upgraded model from Plantronics , but with the issues I had with this model , I would never buy it again .
5 #### How great is it to have portable communication with truckers DB channel 9 ; or Recreational Vehicles , CB Channel 13 , or that POLICE MONITOR CB CHANNEL 9 in the squad car ? Do n't forget about the weather channel NOAA ! I was skeptical about this small CB , but after having it , I am happy . I esp love the SCAN featur , which constantaly allows you to scan all 40 channels like you would a police scanner . This keeps you company better than just staying on one channel , which you can also do . I prefer to hear what is going on all the channels and it keeps things lively for long trips . Any trucker will tell you that its all about the antenna . So choose a Wilson , K90 , or even Cobra ( in that order ) . Having said that , all I had was just a cheap knock off brand antenna I got at the truck stop , but kept me happy . Any antenna , including one I got at Walmart ( Rally brand ) was fine enough to bring in the traffic and get the NOAA broadcasts . If you want to transmit long distance , then invest in a quality antenna .
4 #### Good , but not great sound , and they stay on when you jog or ride a bike . Price is right .
5 #### This little pedal is amazing ... Love it . I can use it with distortion or clean Chanel , I might buy another one just for the clean Chanel ...
1 #### I have written you 4 times and contacted Amazon but no one will help me . I have explained that I had damaged product and I am only seeking a replacement to the damaged VENTSHADE . No one will help me and everyone simply ignores every request to resolve this . I will never buy anything from you again and I will not refer you to anyone . This was a simple fix but I guess not simple enough when you just ignore your PAYING customers . Very disappointed in this whole mess . I have asked for this to be fixed for 3 weeks now . Thanks for ignoring me except to get my money , Johnny Austin I AM STILL WAITING FOR HELP GUYS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! MAYBE A CALL TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU WILL GET YOUR ATTENTION .
5 #### i bought this because when i do my volunteer work it is extremely hard to hear . so with this one i could hear everything that goes over the radio . THIS IS A 1 PIN REMOTE SPEAKER . YOUR RADIO NEEDS TO HAVE A SLOT FOR 1 PIN TO USE THIS . pro . -built nicely -able to have the radio on low and still be able to hear everything ( keep in mind of the noise around you ) -push to talk built in con -i use a safety pin so i could attach it my uniform better . may pull the clothes down a bit ( need to break in the wires has to be looser ) this is something small this does have a clip on the back of the speakers but i do n't like to use it . overall price cheaper now compared to when it first name came out ( about $ 15 less ) sound good just overall its very good . i would recommend this .
5 #### Read that these were the most reliable cards . Been using for 2 months now and no problems . Cheaper memory cards have given me problems in the past .
4 #### These are headphones that were either comparable in price ( at the time Panasonic went for $ 15 ) or design , but they really do n't compare where I need them to excel the most . I do n't use the other headphones unless I absolutely have to because my Panasonic headphones are n't with me .
5 #### these are the best reeds i 've ever used . i use them a lot . i usually buy 2 1/2 reeds i really recommand these plasticover reeds . i use them on both my alto and tenor
1 #### This is my worse nightmare . I bought it on Amazon , arrive a few days later . I charge the phone , start it , everything seems ok . Very slow phone but ok . Am hour later , I receive an update from HTC . Gladly , I update the phone . Shutdown the phone , restart it and then nothing . It tries to boot up but can not , no display , nothing . IT is not a phone anymore , just a piece of dead hardware . It took me a total of 63 hours to learn about androids , find a new firmware , reload the phone with a new firmware by using special software to talk to it and special keystrokes . Fortunately I am an engineer and used my stuborness to succeed but do not wish that experience to my worse ennemy . Then , I found out that it is as slow as a turtle . I gave it to some kid for free , telling him to never accept any upgrade from HTC as it will kill the phone . If you think this is a good deal , think twice . If you think to buy another HTC phone , think twice . I have been given a mytouch 4 G from HTC and HTC just makes bad phones as HTC sense software on all HTC phones is well know to create big problems .
4 #### This is a great reverb pedal that does not change or color your tone at all ! It has a myriad of usable settings from a open room sound to that great ambient modulate setting . The tone control on the pedal is great , if you leave it at 12 ' oclock it does nt change or color your tone , turn it down it mellows the tone out , turn it up and it adds some brightness all the way up to a shimmery sound . The time knob allows you to set it from a mild reverb to a deep 3 - D soundscape . It works similarly to a Dry / Wet knob . The only thing i do n't like about the pedal is the Spring reverb mode is n't very good . It sounds kind of cheesey and is n't a good representation of an acctual Spring reverb unit . For a spring reverb the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Boss - FRV-1 - 63 - Fender - Reverb - Guitar - Effects - Pedal / dp / B002IJQKX2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Boss FRV-1 ' 63 Fender Reverb Guitar Effects Pedal</a>&nbsp;might be a good option . That being said , I do n't really use spring reverb so it does nt bother me . This is a great pedal that is very flexible . I would say its safe to order online without trying it in person due to its great versatility and transparency .
5 #### new cars should be built using this stuff sound is so much better
5 #### I agree with the previous rater " George " this is a subjective rating . However , I subjectively find these picks to be right for me , with the .63 mm size perfect for acoustic and the .5 mm size to be slightly better for electric . ( Edited 10/24/10 to say that is no longer the case . With the last string change on my Strat I changed strings to Fender 250L 9 - 42 instead of bullets and for the 250s the .63 mm is better than the .5 mm . So when my last .5 mm wears out it will be history . ) Features in their favor is that they do n't have that objectionable little divot seen on some other brands of picks , they are symmetrical and they have enough surface ' grab ' so they do n't go flying out of the hand like yet other un - named brands . Plus white is not as cheesy looking as most picks . How long does a pick last ? These will do for several hours of playing , especially if every hour or two I turn them over or change corners . All picks wear out and become curved with use , and these may last a bit longer than average . Or not , depending on playing style .
5 #### You can pay a ridiculous amount of money for the Samsung version , or you can choose this cable instead and pay practically nothing . So awesome . I bought one over a year ago , but I took it camping ( do n't ask ) and lost it . I ca n't believe how inexpensive they are ! I 'm so glad I can replace the cable without having to go hungry for it . I have a Gravity 2 and this cable works with my phone ( or it did until a bear ate it or whatever ) . It did everything it was supposed to , including charging the phone while it 's plugged in . So if you have a USB adapter for your car or wall , you can use this cord as a charger as well . And it 's practically free . Sweet !
5 #### I ordered this because I wanted something to hold my HTC EVO on long car trips over the holidays . I also did n't want to get anything with suction mounts as they can give thieves the idea to break into your car . I 'm not a big fan of the friction mounts so I figured I would give this a try . It works great and it the mount holds securely to the cup holder if you make sure to adjust it out enough . My truck has cup holders in the floorboard between the front seats so that is where I put this . I 'm not sure I would want to us it if I had to put it in the cup holders on the arm rest though . It might get in your way there .
5 #### I bought these Martin M130 Silk & Steel Folk Guitar Strings to replace an ancient pair on a guitar . I am very pleased with the quality and tone of the new strings . I would definitely make the purchase again .
5 #### Great US made strings ! I like the 3 pack savings as lasts me longer .
3 #### Unlike Lexar or Sandisk , Viking does not design or make the components that go into their flash memory cards , instead they use off - the - shelf components ( controller and memory core ) made by others . This means two things : 1 ) lower cost ( to Viking ) , and 2 ) compatibility with devices may not be as robust as Lexar or Sandisk . There have been numerous reports about incompatibility between Viking flash memory and various digital cameras and PDAs . You should do a web search before buying this product . That said , this Viking CF card should work in most digital cameras or older Pocket PCs that take CF . The rated speed of 8x means this is not suitable for digital SLR 's such as the Nikon D70 or Canon EOS Digital Rebel which need higher - speed CF cards ( 40x or higher ) . Most consumer , non - SLR digital cameras will find the speed of this card more than adequate . 128 MB holds about 80 - 100 5MP , high - quality pictures ( depending on the complexity of each picture and the particular camera model ) . I personally recommend if you have a 4MP or more camera , you should have a 256 MB memory card as your primary card , while carrying a 128 MB card like this Viking as a spare . In short , this Viking 128 MB CF card is good for the money . Just make sure it 's compatible with your digital camera .
5 #### This is the best cleaner wax I 've ever used . It 's great at cleaning bugs , smudges , streaks , etc . and leaves an excellent silly smooth protecting finish . I use it on my Jeep Grand Cherokee , my Chevrolet Silverado , and my travel trailer .
3 #### I bought this as a rear view mirror for my computer at work . It worked well until I moved and the sticky backing no longer works . I 've had other mirrors where you could move the mirror around a few times before it loses it 's stickiness , but not so with this mirror .
2 #### Pros : * Well - built * Works well when one is in very noisy environment * Can be charged via USB - cable provided Cons : * Hard to stay in ears * Does n't work well when one is in a noisy but not noisy - enough environment * Does n't work well under windy condition * It 's big If you ever got to check out Jawbone 's demo video on their website , you 'll see the actor showing you how well it works when you 're at super - noisy places . What he does n't show you , is when the volume in the surrounding area is , say in an office where there 're people talking around you . What does it mean ? It means the noise cancellation only works in very noisy environment . The call quality is fine when paired with a RAZR , but not so good with the HTC Touch . People would complain about the echo while paired with the Touch , so I have to take it off when they 're bothered by it . The battery lasts about 3 hours after fully charged ... good enough for me . To keep Jawbone stay in my ear , I got a spounge - like cover and just wrap it around the earpiece , and it works 70 % of the time as long as I do n't shake my head much . I would expect the Jawbone to work better at this price and got hyped up by so many users ... hopefully something better at a reasonable price will come up by the time I have to replace the Jawbone .
5 #### I really like PW cables , actually . Reasonably priced , coil easily , and last for years ( my current set have served me well for going on three years now , with plenty of gigging and getting stepped on ) ,
5 #### There 's not much more to say about the best strings in the world that are affordable to the common player
5 #### I liked this so much I bought a second one ! Outperforms my SM58 and SM57 , sounds warmer , better output .
5 #### I use this for my loud big voice vocals . I play bass so I have to eat the mic when singing so that I know I am right on . This mic only picks up my voice . I did a substitute test with sm 58 's . plug and unplug style and this mic is three times louder , deeper and more articulate than the 57 ... I wo n't use anything else ... I know it would be great for recording gtr.s drums , etc ... 35 years of playing experience and have used them all in the studio . A good mic for a " poor man " ....
5 #### I 'm a slob when it comes to any cleaning chores , so this product is 100 % for me . It 's easy to use . Allowing it to soak in a bit helps produce a good as new look . So if you like doing things the easy no effort way , this is the product I would recommend .
3 #### While the product works quite well , it has a couple drawbacks . It is very thick which makes it quite difficult to squeeze out of the tube . It takes a lot of effort to get a little bit of grease out . More importantly , it is difficult to clean up as it smears on the instrument when you wipe off any excess . It does do a good job coating slides , particularly the tuning slide . I have used valve oil to thin the grease on my first and third valve slides . Personally , I do prefer using Hetman products as they work much better , are easier to use , and last just as long .
3 #### Not a good quality set but it worked . I would suggest to pay a little more and go for the quality
5 #### Daddario has made the best strings for most of my 52 years of trying to play . The BOMB ! ! ! ! I ca n't wait to try their NY strings ! ! !
5 #### Very easy to attach . Took a while to get use to . First ever zoom this big . It is a excellent product .
5 #### Love it ! ! ! Super vivid in color and looks great !
4 #### The tool every guitar owner should have . The winder is a bit cumbersome but does the job .
5 #### This is the second Neotech strap our grandson has used . He plays sax in marching band and uses it every day during band season . He has had it five years and it is still in great shape . We bought the second one for his tenor sax . The foam around the neck is wide and does n't cut into his neck . He has a Yamaha 875EX professional sax and the Neotech strap is much better than the original .
2 #### I do not understand this thing at all . After soaking it in warm water and using it , it moves water around , but does n't absorb it and certainly does n't leave my car dry , it is also hard to move it along the surface of the car .
5 #### Best headphones I ever owned . These headphones does need a so called " burn - in " period ( kind of play loud music for extended ( a few hundreds of ) hours ) . When I first got them , their high frequencies are so storng and sometimes overshadows all other frequencies , they are so piercing that they hurt my ears ( triangles are the worst , cymbals and violins follows ) . However , after several days of burn - in , the highs get better controlled and the base of these headphones are so great in a very well controlled way . Some headphones ' bass are strong but last a little longer than they should , but these headphones ' bass is decently strong and tight . Overall the sound is clear , and detailed . Plugged in my computer , they sound so loud , they can hurt your ears if you use full volume , I normally use around 10/100 in the volume control . I heard that as the headphone being used for longer , the sound can get even better . I got it on black friday for 50$. At this price . it is unbeatable .
3 #### Seems like I 'm a minority but this is not for me . I like how these feel when they work , and they do when new , but when they fail it can get ugly . In my band I have to play acoustic guitar to compete in volume with banjo ( which I can not but I try anyway ) , so I tend to play hard . I typically use medium gauge strings . The problem is that sometimes they chip when strummed hard , and the edge becomes jagged . I 'm not talking about normal wear , i.e. strings abrading / scraping pick materials away slowly and gradualy . In the case of ultex , even though the normal wear is much slower than delrin and celluloid , suddenly some tiny chunk of material flies away and that 's it . Once this happens the edge catches the strings and I can not play solo any more , so I need to swap the pick in the next song to continue playing . I keep the pick anyway and sand the jagged edge later . To give this thing some credit , I 've never had a chipping problem when I play electrics with 10 - 42 set . I can imagine that this is a perfect pick for some players .
5 #### These are great tapes and are getting harder to find , I love my old camera and these tapes keep it working for me .
5 #### This fits my S6 perfectly ! I 'm very picky about cases and it is the first case I 've loved everything about . It feels like part of the phone . I 've had the phone since April and have been through 4 cases looking for one I 'm happy with ; finally found it .
3 #### But I feel the product will be a good spare but would not depend on the wire for a regular ...... Back up
2 #### The pictures are grainy and fuzzy . Colors are not so natural . However for a cheap one - use camera , it is ok . Try to avoid any sun tanning lotion on the camera lense ; otherwise , it will fog . Also , camera needs plenty of light in the water , so it is best used underwater in full sunshine . It works like a toy camera with big knobs .
5 #### Third snare I put one of these on . It works great for taming a really ringing snare without killing the tone . Its too much for less resonant snares like my acrolite IMHO . Great result on birch and steel .
3 #### I 'm sure the product itself is good , the first set lasted for nearly 10 years but they have finally given out become too brittle and started to crack , the tape gave out after about 6 years but this was FL and HI sun everyday . I ordered this set and the Amazon site stated it fit my 2001 crewcab but received visors for extended cab . Make sure you are ordering the right one , google the stock number to make sure other sites state it is for your vehicle just to make sure .
4 #### First let me say this works fine when connecting standard headphones to my HTC made " Verizon Wireless SMT5800 " ( model number LIBR100 ) , clear audio quality , I would say better then bluetooth stereo quality wise so no degradation of the signal . The first hitch is the size , my phone 's a couple inches long and this adapter effectively doubles the length . I really underestimated the size when looking at a picture but it 's manageable . Then it has a quirk where if you disconnect the headphones while the adapter is connected to the phone you have to unplug the adapter again or it wo n't read the headphones when you plug them back it , upon plugging them back in it triggers the voice command prompt for some reason , I am not sure if this is a problem with the adapter or with the windows mobile on my phone . Other then the above two notes this product works fine , ordered it so I could use my phone as a mp3 player on a upcoming flight since my bluetooth headphones would not be a option and I see no reason it will not work .
5 #### This is an excellent product . It 's small , light and simple to use . Highly recommended .
5 #### Threw these on my fender jazz 5 Which is a pretty heavy bass . Works like a charm . I can run around and throw my bass everywhere and rock the hell out and not have to worry a bit . The best in the industry besides Schaller . I personally dislike Schaller because of their design these are way easier to take off your guitar or bass . Definitely recommend to any pro musician
5 #### Have n't had it but a few weeks , but I am learning how to download from the library , etc . love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere . No operating problems so far . Would recommend it for home or away "
4 #### Hi , I 've had this device for about a week now and it 's working very reliably . Here is a quick rundown : - Connects promptly with my iPhone whenever I enter the car - Sound quality is good ( loud and clear , no echo ) - Voice features are working perfectly . Incoming callers from my address book are identified by name and voice control for placing calls is working well . - The magnetic clip system makes it easy to remove for charging and storage .
5 #### I 'm a guitar teacher and a professional guitarist ... have been for many years . I use some great tube amps for live work and at my studio . I bought this amp to bring with me to lessons where I go to the student 's home .... It 's small , sounds fine at low volume , and has the great Vox look to it .. A good clean sound that 's fine for practice ...
3 #### If you use your accessories alot , this is n't for you . It 's not made of high quality material . I used it just to have an extra around the house . That 's about all this is good for . If you are on a budget , this would be the next best thing .
5 #### Update : These strings completely changed the tone on my Martin DC - RGTE and NOT for the better . Not sure why or if I am so use to hearing the DR Rares , but I do not like these AT ALL on my Martin . They were fine on my Takamine and sounded great , but for some reason they sound like tin on the Martin . I 'm gon na give them about another 2 weeks and if the sound does n't warm up and bring back the tone iI am use too , I 'll be ordering another set of the DR Rare These strings are excellent .... BUT ... I have done the comparison twice purposely to prove my point to a few friends and in my opinion , these are not worth the money . You can buy the DR " Rare " strings for half the price and not only do they sound just as good but they DO last just as long . Both the Elixir & DR Rare are excellent strings , they both feel great , they both sound great and they both keep their tone for a long time , but I ca nt see spending double the price on the Elixir when the DR 's are half the price . With that said , if I was n't able to buy the Dr 's locally for $ 8.00 / pack , I would probably cave in and spend the extra money and buy the Elixir . Do n't take my word for it ... See for yourself .. get a set of these http://www.amazon.com/DR-Strings-Rare-Phosphor-AcousticHex/dp/B000788VUG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427550453&sr=8-1&keywords=dr+rare
5 #### You get what you pay for this device did everything it was advertised to do work perfectly I recommend to buy
5 #### I like these strings a lot . Fender is generous with the nickel plating , and these strings feel much more comfortable than other nickel - plated steel strings I 've tried .
4 #### Good for the price . The image quality is good , but the auto focus sometime does n't work . Have to take out and reattach and maybe turn off power and on . It then maybe work .
4 #### Screen small ... hard to read while driving . Battery eater . I use the DC adapter , however . No maps . Not enough contrast on screen . With sunglasses while driving , ca n't see screen . Tiny print on " Goto " destination . Impossible to read while driving . Good , quick operation once you learn it .. Does everything it says it will . I like it except for the above things ....
5 #### Needed this splitter to come out of the projector for audio out into rca 's which seems to get the job done .
4 #### Am I tempted to trust these things with my life ? Not entirely . But they are convincingly simple and reliable ... so I would recommend these .
5 #### Perfect product for connecting DVD player to TV . Highly recommend .
3 #### It kinda ' sorta ' works , but I would not buy another one and I would not recommend this item to anyone .
5 #### The way these balls interchange is simple and looks foolproof . I 've had others that were difficult to change out . The tapered shaft makes these much easier and less apt to freeze up from rust and corrosion . It feels good knowing I can sport bigger balls so easily . Thanks Reese !
5 #### Always ready for me to plug my iPhone in and charge and I love it . Ca n't say anything negative about it .
4 #### These continue to hold a place among my favorite nylon strings . I could never adapt to the frosted treble strings of their earlier lines . The Corum offer the remarkable tone of Savarez bass strings with the more familiar feel of the trebles . Great tone all around , and I 've never had intonation problems like I did with , for example , the Augustine Purples .
5 #### solidly built power strip . Not sure how it will hold up to a lightning strike and hopefully I will never know . Dead quiet and appear well shielded . No concerns
5 #### OK for seventeen cents , what can you get these days ? It used to buy you 17 pieces of Double Trouble Bubble Gum - probably wo n't get you even three pieces now , but for $ 0.17 you can get a really durable and well - made protector for your new favorite toy , the Epic 4G. Has to be the best value in cell phone accessories ever . Buy a bunch .
5 #### This shower head is as close as you can get to the Commando 450 . I 've been shopping around for a shower head that provides great pressure and this one definitely does . With the flow restrictor removed , the shower might actually be too strong and my drain ca n't keep up with all the water . Will do some drain cleaning this weekend and hopefully get everything working like it should . Awesome shower head .
5 #### Bought for my Stratocaster and works fine , also for my acoustic guitar . Not so great for my various basses . Incidentally appears to be polished aluminum not nickel . Maybe they mean nickel like finish or plated but , definitely not nickel .
5 #### Okay . Nice to look at but not to hold water .
4 #### It worked well , I automatically noticed a change in performance , and fuel economy . However , after pouring this can into my fuel tank and filling the tank up ( 1989 Chevy truck w/ a 5.0l ) my gas gauge began to give incorrect readings or the needle would stay at the same spot , or sometimes no readings at all , I 'm not sure if this product had anything to do with it .
4 #### I purchased this item with a new pair of headphones for my wife and I to use with our laptop . The Koss volume control does exactly what it 's supposed to and is a handy convenience to adjust volume quickly and easily . I did n't notice any signal degradation as a result of having the volume control plugged in - line with the headphones . If you need a little extra cord length then that would be an added benefit . My wife absolutely loves the convenience but I 've concluded I could just as easily live without it . Should you buy it ? Just answer three questions and you 'll have your final answer . 1 ) Would you prefer a little extra cord length ? 2 ) In everyday headphone use , do you find yourself frequently adjusting the volume ? 3 ) Do you have the extra cash to burn ? My wife answered yes to all three while I answered no . Did we keep it ? You know what they say , happy wife , happy life . :)
5 #### I used these to attach coated hog wire to the fence in my backyard to keep our smallest dog from squeezing through the bars . These ties are UV resistant , so they are good for outdoor use . They are also very strong . I pulled each tie tight to secure the hog wire to the fence and none broke . For my purpose , eight inches was a good length . In the few instances where I wanted something longer , I just joined two ties . Once you secure the ties , you can snip off the excess and they hardly show .
5 #### Motorcraft quality as usual . Pleased with fitment and quality . No problems at all .
3 #### The non - slip backing came off after a month or 2 or gum workouts . It holds the Phones well and the key storage is really nice .
5 #### Have had this little Ethernet port for home use for a year and a half now . I have it mounted to the side of my computer desk and have not had a single issue with it . Great way to expand your ethernet - connected peripherals . Little LED lights show you when there is a problem or when data is flowing .
5 #### Nice reflective result . Surface prep essential to smooth result , though . Surface must be free of dirt and oil ( even fingerprints ) .
5 #### very quick at my dor step . top quality name brand for 1/3 price . No brainer . and it works well with my new lounge chairs
5 #### this SD card works great iv had no problems iv owned it for 2 months use it in my Verizon moto W755 cell phone to hold video and mp3 music
5 #### Best in their price range for on the ear headphones . During this day and age , I do n't care for the IEM In Ear Monitors . I like normal Earbuds or these . Super great bass , nice highs for a terrific price . What happens if they break ? Just buy another pair .
1 #### We received the BR50 battery a few days ago for my wife 's RAZR cell phone . She tried using it for a few days after charging it and it wo n't hold a charge after making a couple of calls . It is actually worse than the old battery we tried to replace . It turns out this " new " battery was made in 2006 , according to the code on the battery . The old battery that we were replacing was made in 2007 ! So we put the old battery back in . I probably wo n't bother to try to get a replacement since I only paid $ 7.29 for it . If you buy one of these try to verify the manufacture date ahead of time .
4 #### I 've needed this for a long time . Works great . As you are still working with grease it is a little messy . I would recommend this to any serious mechanic as well as the DIYer .
4 #### The item was received in good condition . Packaging could not have been improved on . I was satisfy with the item and it performed as expected and as advertise . I would Recommend the item and would order it again . For the price you could not get a Better deal .
3 #### Very lightweight and kind of cheap feeling . The stylus tip is mushy and not as precise as I expected but can be used . If you lose your stylus often , this might be an inexpensive option , but I think I 'll keep looking for something that is a complement to my iPad .
5 #### Good stuff I hope , let ya know next year . lol
5 #### sounds good on and off a amp.great deal , also have a epiphone 12 string great also.both hold tune once strings stretch out .
4 #### Great holster , so far has been solid and the auto shutoff function has worked consistently . Only quibble - the metal " Blackberry " logo came off . I super - glued it back on , and all is good .
3 #### Took forever to get them developed . I 'm thinking I should have sprung for a few extra bucks and just gotten a cheap digital camera for underwater . Pictures came out fine , but hardly worth all the hassle of getting them developed .
5 #### K. Larson 's review covers it very well , but I 'll add my two cents . For the 25 bucks currently asked , this is one of the best values in a camera bag I have seen . The quality level is exceptional . Extremely well designed , top notch materials , all the right ' extras ' and a lot more than you would expect at this price . High quality rubber / plastic feet , super nice straps ( two ) , easy to fasten , durable , and well machined metal clasps , a great pocket with interior storage on the front , nice padded dividers inside , and a very compact , yet highly usable size . This is not big enough for a DSLR and 2 lenses , flash , and so on , this is more of a compact kit bag , think compact P&S or a mirror - less compact system like the Samsung line ( NX300 , EX2F , NX1100/1000 , etc . ) or Olympus E - PM2 , or Panasonic LX7 and similar . I 'm using mine with the Samsung NX300 and the 18 - 55 mm Zoom . There 's just enough room for the camera and kit lens , maybe an extra pancake lens , charger , batteries , cards , and cables . If you want a light , compact kit to go , this is your bag ! The bag is moisture resistant , has a nice pull - over top flap , great zippers with added " tags " to make them easy to find and grasp , very nice fabric , just an excellent bag in every way . Highly recommended !
5 #### I bought a car that has a k / n cone shaped filter on it . The filter was covered in dirt and grim , with this product I was able to make the filter look almost new . well worth the price .
5 #### Bought the Viking Intelliflash USB Flash Memory Reader because transferring my digital photos from my camera to the computer was too slow . It would take over 1 minute per photo to transfer . Now , with the Viking CF reader , it takes about 2 - 3 seconds per photo to transfer . It works great !
5 #### Could be a little bigger . Hold my extra camera gear pretty good . Would buy again
5 #### Well made . Make sure you tighten the hose really well after you push some grease through . Pump action is easy . Seems well made . Engineered in USA , made in India .
4 #### These little patch cables work nicely , there 's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine .. I 'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5 . The product description says 6 inches , right ? If you jump over to these ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) planet waves patch cables they 're listed at .5 feet ( same as 6 inches , right ? ) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches , whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another . I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up . To conclude , would I recommend these ? Yes , if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable , go for these . But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else .
2 #### Turtle wax , 40/50 years ago was great . It would compound scratches out and remove stains from car paint . I bought it , shipped it over to Vietnam and it would not take gas stains off of my motorcycle . Live and learn . No , I would not recommend this product . jbay
3 #### mea culpa , its a nice piece , well made , just did n't fit my 91 blazer dash . if your vehicle is not on the applications list do n't assume you can make it fit
5 #### It cleans all the K&N filter products nicely and restores them to a like new luster . Have yet to clean my 6 month old filter in my Civic Si , have used it regularly on the YZ250F
3 #### GMC logo on the mud guard was okay . Thickness of the plastic was very light for my liking as it will not be able withstand much stress . The number of installation screws attached were not enough for the installation . I am actually looking forward to buying another model as replacement because it does give me much expected aesthetic value I needed .
5 #### This is a fun little device to put in my mp3 player , a Samsung YP-700H. It also works in PDA 's perfectly , because a friend of mine has one with this exact same memory card . I can only assume it works fine with digital cam 's . As far as mp3 players go , this is sure to work . If you have a low memory mp3 player , get this if it can expand . It works wonders .
1 #### GG Ma is not 79 years any longer and sometimes does n't get the fine print correct . The price was so out of line . you should get 3 for that price . I 'll be more careful what I get from Amazon in the future .
4 #### It gets the job done . Its solid and heavy and will last a long time since I only used it once and maybe a few more times . it does n't fit snug and tends to fall off the bolt head but it 's not loose enough to strip it . If you need one and do n't want to rent at your local parts store , I would recommend this tool for your tool box .
5 #### I use this for when I am at home and need to be hands free for other tasks while conversing with someone . Decent range , but a little static - y when at it 's range limit or there are walls between it and the phone . I 've used the super noise canceling one time but was told that it made things worse , so I just use the first setting . Very comfortable , but I sometimes feel that it might pop out of my ear when I move around . However , when I get this feeling , I can shake my head and it is firmly in place , so it might just be that it is very light . This is the first BT headset I 've used , and it seems to be a good buy . Recommended .
5 #### These are easy to use , reliable , and sturdy . I use one to fasten my daughter 's bike to the back of my bicycle , and it works well .
5 #### I 've been using this stuff for about 8 years or so and I really do n't play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy .
4 #### The oil is what you really need . The cleaner is n't anything special , at least I ca n't tell any real difference from cleaners like Fantastic . But my air filter was n't too dirty .
5 #### Its really good quality . I would always reccomend this brand ! They are expensive but worth it . They also should come with a lifetime warranty if they are new
5 #### Appears to be good quality cable . It is installed and working perfectly .
3 #### These cables can be harder than average to insert and remove . They work fine so far .
1 #### Cheap quality . Buy the stands where a pin slides through !
5 #### Clear amazing cable VERY UNDERRATED incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall
4 #### Bought these to take to baseball games finally got a chance to use them and they work well for their intended purpose
5 #### did not do to much to reduce the judder on my 2006 Wrangler 4 speed transmission , but had good results on my 2000 Wrangler 3 speed transmission , much smoother shifting noticeable instantly
4 #### I accidentally closed one of the ends in my glove box and bent it but it still works perfectly .
2 #### Although the sound quality was excellent , the volume is really low and combined with the over - the - ear design it results in its usefulness while driving or doing outdoor activities , when the handsfree function is required , therefore although a nice piece of equipment , it just does n't delieverwhat it 's supposed to . I purchased mine from Amazon , which i considered a serious seller , but after i took it to a repair shop after dropping it in coffee , the guy laughed at me and showed me its VERY cheap ( < $ 2)ERICSSON speaker ! so , since when does Motorola use ericsson components in their headsets ?
5 #### I purchased the OBD2 code reader to help diagnose the check engine light that appeared on my 1997 Toyota 4Runner . The reader was extremely easy to use ( just plug the connector into the vehicles diagnostic port ) and not only gives you a code but the problem ( in my case a misfire on cylinder # 4 ) , so I can isolate what repairs need to be done . I am very pleased with the performance and the price I paid at Amazon . I recommend this tool to any home garage mechanic wanting to do their own diagnostics on any vehicle 1996 and newer .
5 #### buen vendedor , lo recomiendo ampliamente y el producto es tal cual el expuesto en la venta , muchas gracias 100 % satisfecho .
4 #### They work nicely and are well built . I would like if they lifted just a little higher , maybe a notch or two more . Make sure the jack you have or going to get lifts higher than the height of these stands .
4 #### The Droid X fits nice and snug into this holster , and the face - in design is great for shielding the screen from accidental contact . The swivel design works well . It 's also hard to argue its value ( priced around $ 6 after shipping ) . Why then only 4 stars ? Two reasons really . First , it takes some concentration each time you want to reseat the phone back into the holster . After a couple weeks you find yourself getting better at it , but even then you almost always have to make eye contact . Otherwise if you 're not careful , the curved support edges on the side can put a lot of pressure on the screen if the phone is n't aligned just right . If it 's not already obvious , make sure you are using a screen protector . Do n't rely on the face - in design alone as the only protection . The second issue , albeit a minor one , is the camera lens . There 's absolutely zero protection leaving it fully exposed . If you can live with those two complaints , then this holster is by far the best option out there for the price !
5 #### This seems to work fine on our couch . It is not a cleaner .
5 #### This stand has two big advantages over the competition : variable width ( independent of height ) and second - tier height adjustment . Add to that enough bare floor space between the feet to accommodate really big iron ( like a Beringer FCB1010 ) , and it 's a winner . The only negative , and it may be a necessary evil , is that you have to maneuver about a dozen knobs to adjust or assemble this beast . -Tom Williams
2 #### its OK that s it .. .the snaps do n't snap tight , and if you have a plastic screen cover it scratches it all up and gets dirt under it , thus scratching the actual screen . i would get a rubber one next time even though i do n't like how it fits in my pockets .
5 #### Works what more can I say to have to type 14 more useless word to say what I could say in 3
4 #### My only complaint is that whenever these picks were shipped ; they were not in any kind of bag what so ever . I do n't know if that was from poor shipping handling or what but other than that ; they 're a great pick for rhythm or lead on my acoustic .
3 #### The description for this item , when I ordered it in March 2012 , said " XtraFlex 2 LED Light ! Two Super LEDs in one head give you the lighting power of 6 normal LEDs . You have the option of using one or two of the Super LED lights with just a simple tap to the sensor switch .... " -- yet I received a regular Xtraflex , with only a single LED . I have one Xtraflex 2 already and prefer it -- it has a push button switch that you hit once for both LEDs , twice for just one . This light has a sliding switch that feels poorly made , and only one brightness level . Thankfully , Amazon issued a full refund . Perhaps I should have suspected this item was described incorrectly when I noticed all the other Xtraflex 2 lights listed on Amazon seemed to be more expensive than this one .
5 #### Do n't forget to mark the filter with the install date and Milage so u know when to replace .
3 #### crystals fell off as nothing :( that 's why I really did n't like it but as soon as I saw it I liked it but the stones
5 #### Great sidemount boom . It is relatively short , but that is what I was looking for . It attaches sturdily and positions the mic right where I need it .
4 #### I have been very happy with the SwitchEasy iPhone cases . The holster provides the option of carrying the phone on one 's belt . The phone ( with SwitchEasy case installed ) snaps tightly into the holster , which makes getting it out of the holster a bit of an effort , but not bad . Better than the phone falling out . The clip is large and easy to use , and rotates to carry the phone vertically or horizontally . It remains to be seen how durable the holster is , but at the moment it works just fine .
4 #### At the time , could n't shell out for higher end MDR 7506 or 7509 so settled on this . I 'm not an audiophile by any means , but it 's a decent headphone , but gets hot after having them on a while . Also , did not know this , but from what I 've researched ( after the fact ) , the padding starts to wear off after a few years . You get all this black " dandruff " from the peeling . It was hard to find replacement covers as most do n't make for this model , but rather the aforementioned 7506/7509 's .
5 #### I ordered these strings as a Christmas gift and I knew these were the recipients favorite strings for their Takamine Acoustics . I 'm not a picker but they swear by Elixir Strings .
5 #### The Canon Rebel EOS 2000 is really one of the best buys in 35 mm film cameras . The autofocus 28 - 80 lens works for all but the longest shots , and telephoto lenses are readily available . It 's user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price . It would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality . I 've owned Nikon cameras all of my life(and still do ) and love them , but Nikon does n't really have a comparable camera to the EOS in this price range . This camera is comparable to the old AE1 Program(a great camera also ) , but with more features and even easier to use . A lot of " Bang For The Buck " !
5 #### I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse , my iPad and iPhone , a webcam , an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights . This thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices . I have n't seen any slowness in my webcam , iPad / iPhone syncing or even copying large movies to my external hard drive . This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance . I am however a bit disappointed in the design . This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in . I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another . That being said , the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over . Overall a great performer and a decent design .
5 #### I love this stuff . Keeps the color of my jeans from rubbing off on my seats . Also keeps my leather from drying out . I have been using it for many many years and keep buying more
2 #### Looks nice and does fit , but I was hoping for something a bit more snug around my phone . It 's pretty thin and can be taken off easily which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference . Love the gripping on the sides but I stopped using it because the case kept coming off . Now looking for another :(
4 #### Enjoying these on my ancient Stella . She seems to enjoy them as well
5 #### These are good quality jack stands , and make working under your vehicle more viable . They were easy to set up and they 're easy to use . The price is really reasonable also . I like the color of them , as normal jack stands look bland while these look distinct . They hold my minivan up well , and if weighs at least two tons . These are rated up to three tons , and I 'm sure they could easily handle that .
5 #### Absolutely fantastic microphone . Great quality , construction , and materials . The audio is superb . This is not a small mic by any means . I am sure there are bigger ones , this one has a large girth so keep that in mind if you want to buy a different shock mount . I purchased a shock mount that had the integrated pop screen because the clamp on pop screens just did n't want to wrap around the mic enough to get in the position I wanted . Or , they would n't stay in place and fell down . The integrated pop screen is the way to go .
5 #### When I 'm not using a phone case for protecting my phone , I use one of these . They are nice because they fit nearly any one inside because of the original bulky structure of the G1 , which I do have . I love these and will most likely continue to buy the pouches when my old ones wear out . I bought a N1 pouch a little while ago because I thought it might be the same quality and a good size for my phones . But I was wrong . G1 pouch still wins hands down . Great pouch , super cheap . What 's not to love about that ?
3 #### Loves this case , hated to give to my daughter , the colors speak for it 's self . Great steal . Great buy hope everyone get this
1 #### This new phone is at least 3 - 4 years old and it has a dead battery . I ordered another device from the same time period and that battery was just fine The phone never charged ; the battery indicator stayed red as it charged for over 12 hours . The phone never booted up . DFU mode / restore mode did not help anything ; I am familiar with entering iPods , iPhones , and iPads into DFU mode The computer never recognized the device . Be ready to install another battery in it or returned it .
5 #### Great shutter trip for the Canon SX series on tripod low light shots and bulb shots on my newer Canon D series . Great having one fit for multiple cameras .
5 #### Love them . Oem replacement for 01 acura car runs much smoother now
5 #### It 's time consuming to install but it 's good ! Installed on my mercedes since I put the new magnaflow stainless steel exhaust system . I could not fell too much of a difference but I guess I need some more for the doors and the sealing !
2 #### This item came curled up therefore was hard to stick on phone - which it does n't . The high reflection effects visibility , too distracting .
4 #### Great strings at a great price . These strings have a nice sound to them and they are n't the flimsy little strings you normally get for you guitar . Nice sound for a nice price ...
5 #### I bought this product and used it for something other than the iPhone or iPod and it worked great , at the time I was using an HTC phone . Perfect for car trips , makes everything so much easier and a lot safer .
4 #### I got this case in black from the manufacturer , because I could not find it in any color except espresso here . I got the case for my HD2 . However the black case is NOT leather - it has leather trim , but is about half heavy duty canvas . Pro : Velcro keeps the case secure . Material is very good for protecting the phone . Slide on clip is convenient - to put the pouch on the belt , just push it down . The bottom is " U " shaped , which hooks under the belt and keeps it on . Con : There are no holes in the bottom of the case to help push the phone up . Thus I have to lift up the phone from the front end , which is pretty close to the edge of the case - almost covered . While this is good for security , it makes it a bit more difficult to get the phone out of the case . The belt clip does not have a spring , and thus does not lie flat against the back . I keep thinking the case is going to fall off my belt , although it never has . The design is more convenient , but I sometimes think I would prefer a bit more pressure against the pouch to make triple sure the pouch will remain secure . The velcro makes noise when opening the pouch . Do n't get this one for use during a business meeting or church ! Overall , I really like the case , and recommend it to keep the phone secure .
1 #### I had a Blackberry and moved to N95 hoping for a better phone and email appliance . Boy was I wrong ! To read emails , I need to push 1 . Messaging 2 to 5 keys : Go down with the arrow 3 items to my inbox 6 . Options 7 to 10 keys : Retrieve Emails 11 . New 11 Strokes to read my email ! ! ! Then , if i want to read beyond the header , click and wait again . This is too much trouble , is not friendly or fast . To delete the messages from the phone is impossible , the headers will remain there , unless I delete all the messages from the server . I want my messages on the server , as a backup , but now i need to move them to another folder , for the sake of the Nokia ! After I do that , I need to synch the phone again , and it takes FOREVER to remove and clean up the inbox . This is not a phone for people who use it for work
5 #### Holding cargo down in a pickup bed can be challenging with tie downs only at the corners . Bully has created a product that I can mount and adjust to secure any size load in my truck . Nice job guys .
5 #### Fosmon Extra Long 6 Foot ( 6 ft ) Apple iPhone / iPod Charge and Sync Cable, ... great price for this product . Love that it is longer than the normal cable
4 #### wish it could angle done or have a strap for straping things down/ needs lock down rubber strap/ makes boom mikes unstable/
5 #### I like this reed case better then any one I have used before . Dollar of dollar a really good buy .
5 #### I have been very impressed with these Stylus Pens . They seem to have worked on every electronic we have without scratching the screens . They also do n't seem to get caught on any of the screen protectors making for easy sailing doing what every it is needs to be done . They also do now wear out quickly and give you quite a bit of use out of each one .
4 #### I am still getting used to wearing this earpiece , but other than a little bouncing - movement , awareness that it is there when I 'm walking at a brisk pace and learning how to syncronize it 's use w/ my new Motorola E815 Bluetooth Phone , I 'd give it 5 stars .... Great not to have to lift my shoulder anymore . My Chiropractor Gives it 6 stars , and he does n't own one ! ( Yet ) . Love not having to program each contact ph . number to anything , as the phone improvement takes care of that . I learned it 's awkward trying to verbally dial a call while standing in line at the checkout counter at Albertson 's , but ya got ta learn protocal somewhere , eh ? Yep ! Good piece of Techn here ! Go for it !
2 #### I recently purchased these strings twice within the same month . The first set 's G string popped while I was tuning from Drop C to E standard as slow as possible and almost immediately after I started winding it popped . Then my high e string popped while loosening it from E Standard to Drop C. The second set I bought five days ago and when I set it up in E Standard and it played perfectly fine then I tuned it to Drop C ; everything fine . Suddenly while starting to tune back to E Standard not even turning the peg a quarter of the way " snap ! " it broke . I do not recommend these strinags , particularly for their inability to be tuned back and/or forth , even slowly without breaking . For this reason I recommend Ernie Ball or Fender strings . The only positive thing I have to say about these strings is the bright , clear , soft tone along with their great ability to stay in tuning once tuned better than some brands such as Ernie Ball .
4 #### Works very well . Not the greatest sound but it 's just the thing for patio parties , etc . Make sure to read the manual first .
5 #### Great drum head . You do n't even have to tune it and it still sounds great . I would recommend these to all my drummer friends .
5 #### This worked flawlessly in my smartphone and digital camera . Not much more to be said . As advertised .
4 #### I installed this fan motor as a replacement for my attic ventilator motor that had seized up . The existing unit was not a Lomanco but the size and rating of the fan matched what I had . The installation worked out fine and the fan has been operating for about two months now .
5 #### For what you pay , this is a great pedal . ( Got a discount with Prime ) I was expecting to receive a dinky pedal about the size of my hand . This is a sturdy large pedal , even wider than my guitar wah pedal . I bought this for use with my Yamaha Reface . This is a great buy for amazon Primer 's .
5 #### A good clamp is a clamp that clamps and this clamp clamps ! Glad I bought it !
5 #### Replaced a Blue Ant which I lost on a trip . Jawbone is comfortable , secure on my head , and really good noise cancellation . With the previous headset I would turn the radio down and close car windows- with the Jawbone I do n't need to bother . Also , the customization and spoken status and caller i d are helpful and fun . really good deal for a really good headset- used with LG smartphone , no issues .
5 #### Great strap for the price . Real leather ends . Two inches wide . Nice tight peg holes wo n't pop - off .
5 #### Just bought it , but might be more than I need . I 'm a casual user of cell phones and mainly use them for emergencies . But , with my new phone , and this plan , I am more comfortable making a call , texting , etc . this seems like a very good deal for the price .
5 #### I 've got these on every guitar I own . They 've never broken off and feel solid every time I click them in . Why have a strap that can come off with one move on stage .
1 #### These are by far the worst binocular I 've ever looked through . In any kind of light , there is a bright fringe all the way around the viewing area that makes less than 50 % of the viewing area useful . I did see some reviewers saying they work for inside , in the dark ( theater settings ) and they 're adequate at that . But outdoors they are worse than useless . I ordered these in an Amazon flash deal of some kind from Park Slope Outlet , and you have to pay to return them . Not worth the postage to send them back . That was my bad for being spoiled by Prime . I 'll look more closely at the " deal " next time . And I wo n't even look at Bushnell again . I do n't know why they 'd ruin their reputation with junk like this .
5 #### Got a pack of these to replace the rods on a Tama snare and they went on smoothly and are holding up as one would want to !
2 #### I 've had this holster for less than a month and the swivel clip broke off of it already . I bought this to replace the generic holster I bought from Wal - Mart , which has lasted well over two years by the way . I really like how this items looks and functions , but I ca n't recommend it to anyone because of the swivel clip .
4 #### What is good about this zip drive is that it is very easy to install , and requires basically no configuration , just plug in , and install the software . The one thing I do n't like about it is it sometimes freezes up your computer while you are backing up files . I mean you do n't have to restart the computer or anything , you just ca n't do anything else for a couple minutes . Sometimes that can be a pain . All in all though , its still a good product .
3 #### My review is based on string size too . The strings sounded good but when I play in the higher notes they dropped off in guitar singing power . High notes just do n't have as much volume ? Also the strings are to slippery and my fingers slide off the strings when I try to hold them down . ( more finger pain ) These are custom lights . I recommend regular lights . You can apply more power and volume to them thus making the guitar sing better . I 'd say for a quiet area the custom lights and experienced fingers would sound awesome . I like to be able to play hard and loud when I need to . If you want a softer touch . easier bend , custom light is for you .
4 #### Easy to snap - on , durable , and inexpensive . But very difficult to remove . If battery never wears out , who cares , in two years you get another phone .
2 #### These just did n't lay as well on the screen as other brands I 've used . There were more bubbles and it curled on some edges , making it hard to fit into my case . If I ever decide to use protective screens again , I 'll spend more money for a better product .
5 #### The prices for Brother 's Labeling Tape on Amazon have gone down significantly from when they where first available on Amazon . Now that they are much more competitively priced , I would n't get them anywhere else but here on Amazon . - " crack and peel " Tape Brother 's " crack and peel " tape makes it very easy to remove the backing from the label to expose the adhesive surface . The backing for the label is split / pre - cut along its entire length of the tape . Look Ma , no fingerprints : You can easily crack and peel the top or bottom half or the tape , grab hold of the other half that has the backing still on it to position the tape in the desired location , paste and smooth out the half with the exposed adhesive surface , and finally remove the backing on the other half of the label and smooth out this half of the label . With this method of applying your label , you can avoid leaving any fingerprints on the adhesive side of your label . - Tape for Indoors and Outdoors Brother 's Labeling Tape is designed to withstand weathering , so they are suitable for use indoors or outdoors . --- Brother Labeling Tapes are durable and affordable . The " crack and peel " feature alone makes it worthwhile to switch to the Brother Labeling System .
5 #### Need this to cover my car while I was on Vacation for 35day and it did it job . Cheap but works great .
5 #### I started using Elixir strings on my guitar an recommendation of my son in law . These are really good strings . I 'm in a band so I play quite a lot . The strings stay in tune well and do seem to last longer than other brands I have tried .
4 #### Great bag for my wife 's camera , just the right size for the camera and a few accessories but not so big to bother you
5 #### I was having a tough time getting my tonneau cover clean , this product removed the dirt and brought out the shine .
5 #### This is perfect for Fender Strats or Teles if you do n't want to spend a fortune but still get the protection you need .
5 #### Really good sound quality , battery life & noise cancelling . Voice commands work well . I like the V1 voice commands , except for calling . I like the voice commands on my phone much better for calling . The V1 adds an additional step in accessing those commands . You have to use the V1 " phone commands " then you can use the phone 's voice commands . It 's not bad , I 'd just like quicker access to my phone 's voice commands . I 'd like the ability to go on / off mute quicker . You have to hold the volume buttons down for three seconds to on / off mute . When participating conference calls that 3 seconds seems a lot longer . Apart from the 2 improvements I 'd like to see , it 's a really good headset .
5 #### Being fairly critical of electronics , I did go and look this gift horse in mouth . Results : I am so COMPLETELY pleased with this player , both from my experience and what I 've found by post - mortem research of the competition ! Especially nice : the " resume " feature that mimics the handling of a VHS tape : you can press STOP , power it off , and then come back and pick up where you left off automatically . One MINOR drawback is Pioneer 's obsession with tiny remote control buttons which are a bit hard to find and use in the dark . But , I was able to compensate fine by using my All - in - One universal remote , which was the plan anyway . One feature that would have been nice : a pass - through S - Video that toggles between the player or a line - in ; I had to buy a selector A - B - C - D switch since my TV only has one S - video input . No other wishes or complaints . Picture and sound on any movie ( esp . " Matrix " ) are rock steady and look and sound fantastic !
1 #### This product did n't work for me . Did n't fit my phone . It 's a very cheaply made product and does n't really protect anything . Bought it . Tried it but it just did n't work for me .
5 #### Works fine for my purpose , a wireless speaker I can move wherever I want to listen to my main stereo . I use it in the kitchen and by the pool , which are not wired for my stereo . Sounds about as good as an inexpensive boom box and has a good range .
5 #### Great to fill minor scratch and very easy to manage .
5 #### Monstrously tough kick pad gave Godzilla a sore toe when he tried to sit in on my set without a bass drum pedal !
4 #### Works great with my iPhone 3G. Cord could be longer . It takes it a minute to start the charging . Considering the cost , a great buy .
5 #### I purchased this because it was less than at the auto stores but I could get a gallon at the home center for about 13 bucks . The last time I purchased a gallon of a specific use oil was about 12 years ago for some chain bar lubricant and there 's probably about half that still in the jug . So , do n't buy this if you 're trying to get the best price per ounce . I have some small jacks that needed to be topped off because they no longer lifted to their max height and this did the trick . Not sure about the " stop leak " aspect because I could n't find any leaks on my jacks so who knows where the oil went over the past 12 years or so . My oil arrived with a mail - in rebate for 2 bucks so that dropped the price even further so 5 - stars is the rating because it did the job and I get a few bucks back ... less the cost of the stamp to get it .
5 #### My steering wheel feels better . I bought a cheap used car and the steering wheel was all torn up , so I got this , put it on , and it feels great . It 's really tight , too , so it is n't coming off any time soon .
5 #### Pretty simple case and that was all I wanted . It 's a magnet type snap instead of velcro or snapping a button so that 's pretty cool . I like it a lot cause it was big enough for me to fit a plastic cover around the phone and it still fits good . Basically it was just what I was looking for .
5 #### works really well keeping rain out . stuck really well . easy install !
2 #### Comfortable , easy to pair , affordable . BUT , the volume is inadequate for driving . I have a quiet riding Lexus and had difficulty hearing at highway speed . I ca n't imagine using it in a noisier environment at all . I guess if you 're the kind of person who can talk on a cell phone over loud night club music , this is a nice unit .
5 #### I own a Les Paul case for my Gibson Les Paul Studio . The quality of the epiphone is close to that of the American made one , hands down almost the same exact case . One note , I bought this case for my epiphone Les Paul PRO Custom , I put the guitar into it and it did not quite fit . It was off only slightly which was the foam . Easy fix though I put the guitar in the case closed it and placed the case on its side for about a week . This quickly fixed the snug fitting issue with no problems . I highly suggest to purchase one of these if you own an epiphone and want to protect your baby . This case is well worth its value .
5 #### I love using my iPhone to exercise because I stream Spotify . This handy armband makes it easy to take my iPhone with me on workouts . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Works great and is super loud on my girls Sportster .
2 #### I liked the product was what I expected and very good quality to recommend them all very good product when I can come back to buy
5 #### I 've had this product for about a year and half . I 've had no problems at all . People can hear clearly on the other end , the Mute switch does n't make any noise , volume control seems adequate . It 's been very durable too , I 've dropped it on the floor a bunch of times and it has been unaffected . Most importantly , the sound reproduction quality is excellent . Other headsets I 've used in the past have degraded the sound quality noticably .
5 #### very good , easy use , good quality . can see very very far
2 #### Works on some phones , others not a bit . Ca n't believe these are even sold yet ... Got them for all my family and friends . Not worth getting in my honest opinion .
1 #### This arrived from Tiger Direct a few days after my order , not as fast as direct from Amazon but okay . The unit would not operate at all . ( White LED stayed on ; headset would not pair with the cell phone or turn on or off . ) I called Aliph and returned it to them for warranty swap , a somewhat unpleasant but ultimately satisfactory process .
5 #### Very nice , I can fit multiple CDs in each slot . None of them have fallen out when I was driving and it fits well on my visor . Overall its a good product , I 'd purchase anothe one
5 #### Great tool ! The pin remover in the end is good for a 6 string but for a 12 string it could not lift the inner pins . But all else was as expected and hoped for .
5 #### Hi , the starter motor for my Geo Metro 97 sometimes it did n't work , I was tired of paying the machanic just to clean the solenoid , so I figured I would by a new starter motor , and I got the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/DB - Electrical - SMT0054 - Starter - Chevy - Metro-1 - 0L-1 - 3L-98 - 99 - 00 - 01 - 30005925 / dp / B007Y86WMG / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">DB Electrical SMT0054 Starter Chevy Metro 1.0L 1.3L 98 99 00 01 30005925</a > , so I thought that I needed a heat shield to protect my new investment , that 's when I found the Thermo - Tec Heat Shield . It came well packaged , it includes everything you need to install it . I uploaded some photos of the heat shield with my new starter .
5 #### The fender guitar strings I received are very good guitar strings .
5 #### Very expensive strings compared to everything else I have been using . A friend of mine suggested these saying how nice they sounded and how long they last so I popped for a set . Needless to say , I will be buying more for my nice acoustics . This set is on my Martin and they sound wonderful . Another thing I like about them is the are so comfortable to play that your fingers do n't get sore after a long session from friction . The coating really helps and does nothing to hurt the tone . I would highly recommend spending the extra money for these if you play a lot . My friend plays professionally and changes his once every 10 months compared to every month . I used to change mine every 3 weeks , these have been on my Martin for 2 months and show No wear or loss of tone . Great purchase ... just wish I could get them cheaper or in multi packs for a discount .
5 #### I 've used these strings my entire life . I own both 4 - string and 5 - string bass guitars , and these guys give me the perfect tone . I love that punk rock - harsh steel sound that you hear from bands like Rancid , Guns and Roses and Foo Fighters ; a sound that I get from playing with these strings . Needless to say , these strings give me those tones depending on the instrument I use . I own 2 Ibanez active mic basses that sound perfect with these , and also I have a signature Duff McKagan precision bass with these strings . However , I also own a Gretsch hollow body 4 - string bass guitar that did n't play too well with these ones , and by " not too well " I mean that the full fat body sound that I get from the bass itself got a little lost with these strings . It still sounded AMAZING , but I like that fat sound better , so I changed these strings for a " DR Strings NGB-45 Coated Nickel Bass Guitar Strings , Medium " set ( these ones shine with dark fluorescent light ) and found a better tone according to my needs . Wraping up , these are the perfect strings for some good ol'fashioned rock and roll , or that street punk rock sound .
2 #### When we use this on trips and try to run a movie player and plug two phones into it , the phones both tell us they are not getting enough power to charge the batteries .
5 #### Works great and every garage should have this . This device puts me in control of my discussions with my mechanic . Knowing the codes behind the light allow me to research and understand the possible issues before the mechanic goes on a wild goose chase racking up the bills . Now I can walk in tell him the codes and my evaluation and start the conversation from a position of knowledge .
5 #### Sexy red finish , spring loaded action , heavy steel and smooth rubber on the string side . I needed a delicate capo for my baby and this was perfect . It even matches my Guitars finish . I am very happy with my purchase
5 #### For the price i am amazed . I have a bit of an obsession with good headphones / speakers . These do not disappoint . Very accurate representation of sound . Truly , for the price , you will not find a better set of headphones . Though if you are looking for bass boosters , etc . these are not for you . The bass is great , but accurate . If you want Beats these are not for you . If you value sound quality and accuracy , or just a pair of great headphones for occasional use , I highly recommend . Only thing that worries me is the wire that comes out of the head strap to the ear pieces . No issues so far but if they get snagged on something could present a problem .
4 #### Great for small devices like smartphones . But its starts shaking and rattling around with large devices like GPSs . Opens about four inches wide but rotates around 360 . EDIT 5/23/2012 I still have the unit . I just made it rock solid . How ? With super glue . I super glued the bottom to a base - one of those bean - bag bases . Now it no longer sucks .
5 #### It holds my blackberry curve prefectly , even with the protective skin on ! Rotates and stays .
5 #### I bought this for our new T4i Canon camera and lens . 55 - 250 lens , camera , 2 extra batteries and charger are a perfect fit . Great quality . Could n't ask for better . Best purchase in awhile . Get it . You will love it too .
5 #### Works perfectly for the Firehawk FX Line 6 effect controller .
5 #### does the job , easy to use as mobile or HT . nobody answers radio check anymore , but it will reach my base from about four miles on a Firestick on Hi - top HC van 's spare tire rack . As a HT , it is clear , using AA batteries , but short range , maybe a half mile on the " rubber duckie " . Flat terrain , at six feet above sea level , heavily populated .
5 #### My wife and I have been using the Razor phone for more than 15 years . It is still the best basic , durable and dependable phone on the market . Since neither of us really need the ' fancy ' features that are out there today , this phone meets all of our needs .
4 #### The hose works as designed however be sure your order the right one or you 'll have to try and return it . The ends seem a little weak though or maybe I just over tightened the adapters .
5 #### If your looking for light strings these are perfect ... Nice bright sound through aftermarket acoustic pickup ... Recommend for any acoustic They make my 100 dollar campfire guitar sound like something triple the price .
4 #### I found the camera extremely easy to use and the Macro setting to allow close up photography was a great feature . My only problem with it is that it eats batteries . I HIGHLY recommend investing in the AC adapter for when you photograph indoors . That was tyhe only drawback that I found .
5 #### My little grand son love it . Everything went fast , just the way was pictured . Best seller . Thank you Georgeta
5 #### These reeds create an instant sound , very resonant and warm . I will continue purchasing this product , as you should as well !
4 #### Excellent little guitar stand . Solidly built and well padded . I am currently using this for a Gibson SG and Ovation acoustic . Fits both well .
4 #### It works really good on spots ... NOT for widespread areas because of nozzle focus .
5 #### good holder for your Ipod , phone or gps they hold . I had one on my Ipod for 2yrs . this one for the wife bike . the good you will not be disappointed .
4 #### It 's not really needed but I bought a bottle . Dawn dishwater soap works just as good .
5 #### This is an excellent all around solid performer . When compared to a stock Shure 92E , this Audio Technica 92ECD stands head and shoulders above the stock Shure in terms of high frequency response - cymbals etc . I 'm sure the narrower elliptical stylus helps . However , a Shure M92e with an upgraded stylus gives this AT a good run for the money . No , the AT 's not as " neutral " sounding as the Shure , but , to my ear anyway is also quite balanced . This is a good basic upgrade cartridge . It 's not an " audiophile " contender but reproduces music nicely , well beyond most basic cartridges . Good " universal " value especially in that it can be used as either a P mount or standard . Have a listen , you ca n't go wrong for the price .
3 #### this did n't work and eliminate the hum my issue was something else and not what this item was intended to fix . I put 3 stars only because I did n't need it to eliminate my issue and ca n't really say if it 's good or not .
5 #### simple , easy to use , works well etc . I would recommend this to any level player . It is a great value .
5 #### Kaces makes the best keyboard protection gear , hands down . Much better than " Body Glove " , " Gator " and most all other manufacturers . They actually use heavy duty material and dual zippers unlike a lot of manufacturers in this price point .
5 #### i m running this pump on a big block blown chevy in a 69 chevelle and its pertty quiet for what it is has great pressure pull low amps it is a great value for sure
5 #### This case is made of TPU ( Thermoplastic Polyurethane ) material , which makes for a more rigid , better - fitting case . It looks great on the phone and does n't make the phone look bulky at all . Best of all , the smooth texture prevents the phone from getting caught in your pocket and does n't attract lint as do the silicon cases . The argyle design looks great too . I highly recommend this case .
4 #### Super simple , plug and plag my internet TV controls . Roku and Apple TV controls did not have the reception for consistent WiFi connections . Hard wired to the internet and running great
5 #### I discovered Ernie Ball lightweight strings when I played coffee houses some 45 years ago . They had that extra " twangy " sound I was looking for folk music and were easy on the fingers . The .009 and .010 strings are a little prone to breaking , so DON'T OVERTIGHTEN THEM ! If you are a little bit careful and use an electronic tuner , you should n't have any more problems than you would with any other strings . Time proven strings that perform really well and do n't cost an arm and a leg .
5 #### Amazon 's part matcher shows that this bulb does n't fit for a 1999 Toyota Camry . Amazon is WRONG ! This bulb installs easily and has excellent luminosity . I 've only had it on the car a couple weeks , so I ca n't speak to its life . Here 's hoping its German origins give it excellent durability and life ! Update , 2015 ... worked as of when I sold this car last year .
5 #### Very nice flatwound strings with a good clear sound . First Flatwoods I 've ever had , but will buy again .
5 #### Went through several cheap guns all gave headaches , this one finally works as it should !
4 #### Secure case . Love being able to sling it over my shoulder . Compartment only for the neck and one mouthpiece ; the reeds and other items need to be put in a bag and stowed in the bell .
5 #### I 've been using D'Addario EXPs for quite a while . These are basically mediums with a light gauge 1st and 2nd strings . The jury is out on my new Martin as I noticed a bit of a volume drop when I switched from the Martins that were on it new . The Martins have more tension . We 'll see .
5 #### Looks bright , soft silicone rubber . Good home case , but being so soft and malleable I would not expect too much protection on a waist high drop . I like if for the color .
5 #### I love the soft , clean sound of these strings on my Acoustic / Electric . I used to put heavier strings on it , but since I have two acoustics , I put the Silk and Steel on one and heavier strings on my dreadnaught . For quiet evenings and mellow music I highly recommend these strings . They may be too light for a campfire sing - a - long . Do people still do that ?
5 #### When I received the headphones I was pleasantly surprised . I had to find some that were cheap , as my Turtle Beach TBS-2052 Ear Force Z2 was damaged . I 'm glad I listened to the good reviews I found . Surprisingly , the bass is deep , despite the size and type of headphones . If you like or not , that is a matter of personal taste . In my opinion , I had never bought a pair of headphones that were so cheap and also had such a good sound . One more thing : these headphones are not pretty , but its quality and durability are excellent .
5 #### Just arrived , these will be useful in electrical projects , Thanks .
5 #### Excellent switch , if you want a reliable piece of hardware to keep your network running , get this switch .
5 #### This may not be the cheapest accessory out there , but if you hate having your hitch rattle due to a light trailer , this will be your new best friend . This thing is well made and tough , so that 's part of the reason for the cost . But when it gets down to it , it works . Very glad I went ahead and bought it .
5 #### offers a whole new level of ear thumping purgatory every time my son plays , which is almost every evening . at least the sound is pure and vibrant compared to his old set of heads . i highly recommend this item for anyone looking for one of the best drum heads and at an affordable price .
3 #### it is a general guide i knew it would be , much better than nothing
3 #### I followed the directions for cleaning the top but it did not do much as far as cleaning off the grease from the top mechanism on the lower sides of my tan fabric top . It did however provide a nice protective water resistant coating when applied as others have done here instead of using the sprayer . I used a brush and coated the top as if painting it . This way it goes on heavier and does not cause over - spray on painted or glass surfaces . While I only gave it a 3 star I am sure it is as good as the Rag Top brand and a lot less expensive . It should also be noted that our top is very old and was not properly cared for before we bought the car so it very well may work a lot better on a newer top .
5 #### I have been unable to find the battery I need for my cell phone . I could charge it and after one phone call my battery would die . I went on amazon and they had the battery and it was in stock . I ordered it and received it super fast . It made my week when I got it and it is working perfectly . Thanks !
2 #### Fell off windshield shortly after install . Followed directions to the tee and it still fell off . It 's an easy install , but now I 'll have to super glue it to the windshield . Not exactly what I wanted to do , but you got ta do what you got ta do . Performance is medium at best , but that 's all I was looking for anyway . Two stars because it fell off . If I had gotten two or more trips in and then it fell off , maybe another star , but the first trip is it 's gone , not good . At least when it fell off I was not moving , so I did n't lose it . Someone else may not be as lucky as me .
5 #### I purchased this to bypass the factory amp in my 01 GMC Yukon without doing so my replacement radio would n't work without running new wires to each speaker , it used in conjunction with another adapter and needed to be replaced pinned , if you have GMC with a factory amplifier this will help bring your system to life(just remember it 's not plug and play for this purpose you have to modify it )
1 #### Purchased 3 pair of these binoculars in June 2013 . Arrived quickly and with no damage . However , took them to Yellowstone for a family vacation before even trying them out . All three were defective in that you would see double while looking through them . Obviously I should have tested them right out of the boxes but I did n't ; hindsight . Again , all three were bad in that when you would look at something you would see double . Do n't know what the problem was- alignment , whatever . I could no longer return them to Amazon as it was too long and Bushnell said that it was past their warranty period as well . So , I 've got three useless pair of binoculars . Never again with Bushnell .
5 #### Great product and easy to use . The only thing bad once disconnected is its size . It is hard to lay it anywhere without bothering passengers . Hardly the products fault . There are different versions and sizes of this product . I went large to accommodate my f150 .
5 #### When I first started playing , it did n't matter what kind of pick I was using . I was too concerned with what my fret hand was doing . But after a while I began to take notice of which picks felt right versus which ones did n't and I began to single out my favorites . I had settled on Fender mediums as my pick of choice yet felt they could be better . After all , you take an aggressive song with a couple good pick slides in it and your Fender pick looks like Jethro 's gap - toothed grin and the edge is completely worn away . Once I discovered the Dunlop Delrin picks , I have not used another brand or style . Simply because they were exactly what I was looking for . Just enough resistance to keep the string attack clean and enough flexibility to keep the pick firmly within your grasp . The materials from which the Delrins are made offers superior wear resistance . Greater wear resistance = longer life = using fewer picks . I used to go one or two songs and need a new pick . Now one pick lasts me an entire rehearsal . Buy these , see for yourself !
4 #### A big improvement with the jaws at the top . But there 's an issue if you use this stand for gigs . If you collapse it for transport , the jaws at the top spin around ( expected ) but there 's no locking mechanism to keep them on that side . So there 's the opportunity to get your fingers pinched ( which of course is not good before playing a gig ) . A simple clip would have improved the travel usability tremendously . I have a heavy duty rubber band on the top , but its a bit cheesy looking .
1 #### I sent the product you buy , a bad buy , a bad buy , a bad buy , a bad buy , a bad buy ...
1 #### This product has a very cheap feel to it . On top of that , it does not work ( the plug fits the phone , but the phone does not receive power ) . I will be returning this item and purchasing a different car charger for my wife 's phone .
3 #### I bought these on sale for a really good price . I would buy them again at that price , but probably not full price . They work fine , but I do n't care for the tone of them . Maybe you 'd love them , I do n't know , its a pretty subjective property .
4 #### Great material its fiberglass backed and the adhesive sticks well . I used this on the inside of my side by side center console to shield the heat from the engine . It appears to work well as I took a torch to it and the outside stayed nice and cool ! Hope this cuts down some of the motor heat while riding on the hot summer days although I may regret it in the winter . I bought a second roll from the local autozone for the same price and does n't go very far unfortunately . I also used some 3 M spray adhesive to coat the factory heat material before applying the thermo - tec which made it adhere well . I have not head any seat time in the machine since so I can not comment on how well it works yet . I will update once i Have some seat time on how well it works .
1 #### I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day , even when the phone was turned off . The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem . After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center , they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable " due to customer abuse . " I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage ( unless using it to make phone calls counts as " customer abuse " ) , but got the same comment , without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation . It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty . You 'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works . After that , you 're on your own .
5 #### I bought this for use in a dorm room , where I needed to turn one port into multiple ones ( For PC , Xbox 360 , etc ) . This switch works great . I plugged it in and it worked right away . I have recommended this product to several friends .
2 #### These ear bud broke after only 2 month of use . My wife though them out .
5 #### Make sure you cover your car 's paint with towels or a tarp before applying - one warning : the mist will leave a residue on your paint that takes quite a bit of effort to get off .
5 #### i ve tried many other blu tooth head sets and none of them worked for me so i was looking for a wired head set but my cell phone uses an adapter and i did n't like that so i thought i would try this wep 200 , and it worked great but kept falling out of my ear , i even wore it in the swimming pool because i forgot i had it on , i dried it off and it kept working . late this spring it finally fell out of my ear into the yard and i lost it . this fall the neighbor kids who play in my large yard found it . it was covered with dirt and had survived mowings twice a week the sprinkler system every day , thunderstorms and just being in the damp outdoors for 3 months . to make a long story short , i 'm still using it , i have it on right now . i solved the problem of it falling off by purchasing the ear hooks for it , they are cheap so i have bought several and they really work.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Samsung - WEP180 - WEP200 - WEP210 - Bluetooth - Headset - Hook - OEM - AAET180SBEBSTD / dp / B000X16PLY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Samsung WEP180 / WEP200 / WEP210 Bluetooth Headset Hook [ OEM ] AAET180SBEBSTD</a >
5 #### I 've seen simmalar cables selling for much more money , the Belkin cable does a fine job at a fair price . It works with all of my firewire devices on both Mac and PC .
5 #### I 've bought bluetooth headsets from many different manufacturers , and Plantronics seem to be the best ones for their pricing . I absolutely love this model and the c330 , and I 'm sure I will purchase a few more of each of them . The pros for this headset : -its inexpensive but not built cheaply -it is easy to operate -good for approx 500 recharges -very easy to pair with multiple phones -very secure fit -decent volume range -decent noise canceling -can take a pretty good beating before it breaks -stays paired and connected much better than many top - dollar headsets the cons : -takes some getting used to the ear nub -does not handle getting wet very well ( but its not meant to for that matter ) -noise canceling is n't top notch , high pitched noises are brutally painful -proprietary charging plug means its harder to replace if needed , and creates more waste down the line .
5 #### I have had this over a year and it works great . I like how it keeps you hands free and can move with ease .
5 #### This is my second K&N filter for my expedition . I had my old one for 7 years and nearly 210k miles . The old one was still functioning fine as I did biyearly cleaning and recoating of filter , but I accidently squashed it , ( do n't ask ! ) . So this unit will out survive the car if I do n't screw it up again . Just an overall great product .
5 #### This is a classic overdrive sound , for a very progressive price . Cranked all the way , it will give you the classic rock distortion associated with acts like Mountain , Cream , The Who , Free , Bad Company , the Allman Brothers , Lynyrd Skynyrd , etc . In fact , it 's very close to the tone Warren Haynes gets in Gov't Mule . It 's very quiet , has the exact sound it advertises , and you can use the dual outputs to feed signal to two amps ( ie : one with just overdrive , one with overdrive+effects . If you 're looking for metal , keep looking , but if you play blues , classic rock , or jazz fusion , it 's well worth the low price .
4 #### Works well with Lil Wil antenna but not without it . Beware advertising leads you to believe you need the get cable and handheld antenna , you do not . If Amazon does n't stop this misleading I will not buy here anymore .
5 #### Good enough , they 're ridiculously cheap , and they do exactly what they 're supposed to do . Could n't find better at this price point .
5 #### Gets the job done . Simple and solid . Pretty quiet ( as in no extra noise ) . I like the fat rubber covers that they give you that fit over the knobs so you can use your toe to change the knobs . Also , the knobs are easy to read without bending down . So many pedals are so hard to read the dials , even if you bend down . Not this pedal . Very easy to read and adjust .
4 #### I got this bag for my wife for Christmas 2012 when I got her a T3i . This bag is well made and holds all kinds of stuff that I got her for the camera . My only complaint would be that the camera with a lens attached has a hard time storing an additional lens . It can be done but not with ease .
3 #### ITs what is says it is . But I wish it were more . I also with the description made everything a little more clear .
5 #### This product was exactly what I wanted . The service was great too . I would definitely recommend this to my friends .
1 #### This product claims to restore plastic but after 10 minutes of scrubbing one headlight cover with it and a terry cloth ( as recommended ) , there was hardly any noticeable difference . I do some bodybuilding so strength of pressure application is not the problem ! There are better products out there but I do n't know if I 'm allowed to mention a competitor 's name lest someone think I work for them ( I don't)--it 's Novus ' 3 - step system !
4 #### Fits well and better quality than the original cover that came with the RV .
3 #### Pretty light duty . Will not withstand daily use . I use this occasionally to remove and clean plugs on a 2 stroke outboard . I doubt it will withstand any heavy torque .
1 #### This unit has proven to not work on almost everything I have tried to use it on . I would not order again and wish I could return it but it was a gift and is now too late I believe .
1 #### This thing Broke after a week . This was the Second disappointing product I 've ordered from amazon . Buy at your own risk .
4 #### Nice binoculars to replace my 30 year old set . I like the 3d effect you get from these- do n't know if that is the type of prism used or what . Glad I did n't buy the more expensive set that I was contemplating . These work grea .
5 #### I like the wrap but it does wear down fast if you 're using gloves as well . Ca n't knock a star off for that , however ..
5 #### My battery on my watch ( Tag Heuer ) died and I needed to replace it . This battery fit perfectly and now works like new . I would recommend grabbing some of these for a replacement in a watch .
5 #### Most of the review is copied and pasted from another review I did for a Belkin ethernet cable , this one being used in the same manner . This shorter one was exactly what I needed for the space in which it is being used . I do n't know what else to really say about this , or any of the MANY Belkin cables I have bought from Amazon , except that they work very well for my requirements . This specific one is being used in my home theater system to connect a component to a switch box . It did not need to be pulled through any walls or stressed in any other way , but it 's been fine for my use of it . Some people think they are not the best of quality but I have not ever had any go " bad " or break or not fit correctly . You * can * get cables even cheaper than these from Belkin , but I do n't trust them ... the Belkin cables here on Amazon are still FAR cheaper than what I have seen in stores , and I refuse to let instant gratification make me spend too much for something like this !
2 #### Loose fit but good deal if u only need it a few times
5 #### No chrome over plastic here ! This a chunk of solid steel ! The felts and counter nuts are excellent and allow the top to float very nice for sizzle and " pshht - pshht . " The bottom nut is part threaded so it locks and NOTHING to break ; I have really enjoyed it . Put one in the box as if nothing will ever happens y'know . I use it on a heavy Tama with 14 " vintage New Beats .
5 #### The only downside to these is how loud they can be to the people around you . Otherwise the sound is clean and bass is great for the price .
5 #### Item as described ; fast ship ; This works great and supports HDMI 1.4 as advertised . Many other cables state " latest standard " but most of them are 1.3 , not 1.4 . Make sure you do n't get an obsolete cable or you will be disappointed . I have had this in place for several months now with multiple flexings and windings and movings -- absolutely no issues with cable or connector . I 'm pleased .
3 #### It 's a cable that worked great for a phone that has used all of its nine lives . Shame , it has never been rivaled and seems to be a collectors item . The cable may well be too , I tried a generic and it did not work , a Nokia employee told me ( at the time , years ago ) that Yes , it Makes A Difference .
5 #### Fit perfect . Rolls up small and covers the whole windshield .
3 #### I wish that the adhesive where a little stronger . The backing is similar to those 3 M removal hooks but nowhere near as sticky .
4 #### Be sure to get an antenna if you are using it in your truck . Otherwise you 'll reach about 100yards .
3 #### Pretty chintsy & flimsy feeling . OK optics , nothing special . Not particular effective at night . Good to keep in the truck . Maybe .
4 #### Took these on a cruise and they were fabulous . They hold up well I was worried about dropping the camera and breaking the plastic .
5 #### I too love my 990 . I bought it to replace my 950 which was a wonderful camera . I agree with others that the 990 's menu system takes some time to master if you really want to maximize the potential of this camera . You can use the auto mode to take great pictures right out of the box though . This camera , just like the 950 is a hog for batteries . I like the fact that I can carry regular AA batteries as an emergency backup , but better yet , get two sets of rechargeables . I use the camera to take " crude " pictures of radiographs and intraoperative pictures . The ability to select for light source makes this much easier . It does a very good job for the radiographs and takes excellent surgical pictures ( great color accuracy ) . The flash unit is fairly weak so consider trying to get the elusive external flash adapter ( hard to find in stock ) . That 's my only complaint with these Nikon digital cameras . The accessories are sometimes very hard to get .
3 #### We all have different tastes in guitar picks , I know , As I wrote elsewhere , the Dunlop Tortex are awful for acoustic , in my opinion . These Ultex are much better . Not as noisy , better feel . Still not my favorites . I 'll have them with me for spares .
1 #### I purchased this item recently to use with my Nokia 3650 ( an amazing phone , btw ) . One would think that when Amazon lists the headset as being compatable with the 3650 , it might actually work . That 's not the case at all , I 'm afraid . Apparently , you need to have the cute little blue sticker on the outside of the box for it to work . To their credit , Jabra offered to cross - ship the unit , and Amazon is going to send me a pre - paid return label and will refund my purchase price and shipping . All that 's nice , but I 'm pretty miffed that I have to mess around with all of this .
4 #### Good picks , but I hate 'em . Not the picks fault , I realized shortly after I bought 'em that I just do n't like the big triangular form factor . Hence the good review , but the me - not - liking-'em thing . You might love 'em . They are well made , good tone and grippy . ( I find that " 'em " is easier to type then them " - one less character - but now I just trashed that efficiency by explaining that . On the other hand , what is there to right , really , in a pick review ? ) . I have gone over to Wegan picks , which are just superior to most of what is out there , imo , for me anyway . Gravity picks are a close 2nd , better for some things . Although there is some fair competition . V - picks are fun too , especially if you like really fat picks . Have fun !
4 #### Works great . You ca n't replace Honda CRV crankshaft seal without this . Inexpensive .
5 #### Cool that it comes with a couple different options to fit whatever head unit you install . Fit well , looks ok .
1 #### D'Addario XL and the terrible , horrible , no good , very bad strings ! I 've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings . I thought I 'd buy these " cheap " strings for practice , and use a higher end ( NYXL ) for gigs . Whoa , big mistake . Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether . There 's a reason they 're cheap , and I 'm thoroughly convinced now it 's because they 're made of the cheapest material known to mankind . After about an hour 's worth of use , these things are absolutely toneless . These XL strings , after an hour of playing , sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending , slashing , and strumming . Straight up , the XL is garbage . Period .
4 #### I 'm very faithful about conditioning my leather seats . I 've previously used another brand for years that was very good . A detailer told me this is better for the seats because it 's pH balanced for leather . Do n't think this is any better , but it is still good and cheaper when considering the bottle size .
5 #### These went on easily . The adhesive is holding up well 2 weeks in . The hardest part was removing the old adhesive . What worked best was a hear gun and plastic putty knife then clean up best you can with Goo Gone or something similar .
4 #### A corded remote switch is a must have for any tripod photography . Cable could be a couple of feet longer .
5 #### If you have an old Thinkpad , I 'd highly advise you purchase more than one of these skins . I 'm still able to surpass 60 words / minute easily with the skin over my old T510 . For an " A " in my Personal Typing Class you had to achieve 60 words / minute on a mechanical Royal 440 with blank keys . I know for many , that 's not very fast but those of us who can still type are spoiled today compared to what was available before an IBM Selectric was invented .
4 #### I still rate it 4 stars because of the quality of the sound , the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price . Sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes , so that means it 's great , right ?
1 #### Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone , the ear bud is too big , uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear . After two weeks of use , the on / off switch stopped working , and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit . In sum , it was a waste of money . There was no provision in this review for " 0 " stars , so I gave it " 1 "
5 #### It is a good product . Good quality . And for people who need it , I recommend it 100 % . In addition , this a good price .
4 #### The band is a little tight , but the sound quality seems to be good . The earpieces have nice foam pads , and their mounting to the band allows them to pivot a little to snug up against the ears well .
5 #### i love my steering wheel cover ! hate that it 's difficult to get ahold of .
5 #### I bought this for my only cousin who lives far away . Now I can talk to her anytime I want to ! She also has made connections with old friends and some new ones too ! She had NEVER used a computer or anything like it . The instructions were simple . The fee to get it going is only $ 9.00 a month . She is absolutely delighted with the Mailbug ......... thank you so much for a quality product and very quick delivery ! Sally
1 #### At first , I thought it would be great to have extra light strings on my guitar . I have a GS Mini Taylor . Well , disappointment ! They did n't stay in tune at all . I found myself tuning between each song , and my conclusion is I wasted the money . I went to a guitar store and they put on the Elixer light strings . The sound is 100 % better ! I have played at least 10 songs so far and minor tuning at most . I do n't know what the extra lights are for , but certainly not my type of guitar ! The mediums were recommended in the user manual , but I found barring difficult . Much easier with the Elixer lights .
2 #### I ca n't really say I dislike the cable or anything , but wanted to inform you that Cables Unlimited put a Micro A cable in the package even though it 's labeled Micro B. I just emailed them for an RMA , which hopefully will go thru fine , but still I am going to have to pay to ship it back to them and then wait at least a week before I receive the correct cable . Meanwhile , I will have to get under my driver 's seat and plug in my only Micro B USB cable to my car - puter in my WRX to charge my LG Dare phone on my road trip , then get back under my seat and unplug the cable and take it inside if I need to charge the phone while at my destination . Overall , an amateurish mistake , especially for a company that specializes in cables ( Cables Unlimited ) and one of the only actual Micro USB cables on amazon.com ( you might see another one made my Zen that says Micro USB but it 's actually just mini USB ) .
3 #### Not enough for real tech or real car problems Has some good pointers for DIY guy Wiring dia 's lacking lots of wires
5 #### Fast delivery ....... E - Z installation ..... You can watch Videos on these on Youtube ..... they are very helpful even if you are a good wrencher . They give you a visual of doing the installation before hand and some lil tips along the way . I teamed these up with a set of COIL SPRING made by Superior .. and a set of Air Shocks ..... and I must say my lil S-10 is now capable of hauling quite a load ...... rides entirely different ..... lifted the truck bed 3 1/2 inches higher too ! I do n't no why , but it still rides good and not like a buck board which I thought it would . You can not get the results any better for around $ 200.00 for all of them ..... Leaf Spring Helpers , Coil Spring Load helpers , and Air Shocks at around 60 bucks ..... all bought here on PRIME ..... NO SHIPPING .... Even to my remote Southeast Alaskan town where everything is flown or barged in ! ! ! GREAT PRODUCTS ..... GREAT BUY ! ! ! Cheers !
5 #### My riding lawnmower plastic gas tank was leaking badly . I tried stopping the leak with a couple of other sealers , including J - B Weld , without success . Finally I used the Seal - All Adhesive . It stopped the leak , saving me the cost of a new gas tank , over $ 75 . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### This metronome is simply the best . No electronic metronome I 've tried has a clap and ring that penetrates like the original design of Maelzel ( that Beethoven parodied in his 8th Symphony ) . I highly recommend the bell with adjustable intervals --- if you get off the beat , the bell will bring you back to the downbeat . The wood finish on these models is sumptuous . The gearing is plastic , which I worry may not be as durable as metal , but hey , the Germans know what they 're doing right ? It may simply not be an issue given the stresses it actual receives . The bottom is easy to open up --- I found the bell rang a little too long so I put a tad of tape on it to dampen it to my liking , and the design made it easy to access . The lid latch is superior to the sliding hook of the old designs which could scar the wood . And anyway , what could be more cool that having a pyramid in your living room ?
4 #### This is nice speaker wire , however it is thick ( flat and wide ) and much thicker and heavier than the speaker wire I am used to , and for me , it was oddly shaped . The wire itself has the consistency more like hair than wire making it hard to push through the holes in the speakers . It works nicely and it 's a great price for the amount of wire you get . I must not have read something correctly because I was really surprised at the sheer bulk of the wire itself .
3 #### It 's ok , but fit was a little baggy . Seems to get dirty easy ( I know , it 's white , duh ) but does not clean up well . Ended up not using it .
5 #### High quality wiper that was easy to install on the Frau 's 2012 Honda Odyssey , passenger side .
5 #### I was dubious about this , but based on the reviews I figured it was worth a shot . It 's BIG , twice as big as you 'd need , really , and it 's made of this unpleasant - weird feeling kind of rubber - jelly - synthetic - skin material . Quite squishy . And thirsty ! I read the directions , rinsed it in warm water , wrung it out , then dried my car with it . I laid the whole piece down on half the windshield , voila , DRY , no spots or streaks . It holds a remarkable quantity of water . If it held any more water , they 'd sell it for emergency water storage . My car looks great , completely dry with no towels or squeegee - ing . I am completely satisfied with this product . --- I ran it through the washing machine and then accidentally through the dryer . It came out looking like a tumbleweed made out of pasta , but as soon as I got it wet it regained its original texture . Really odd material . Works great !
5 #### Good price for a good product . Received in a quick time without any problems
1 #### Bought this in 2010 , basically on the basis of good reviews , primarily for automotive work . The unit I received was not operable and I returned it . The replacement unit worked about half a dozen times ( which for me is a year of use ) before also dying , while still on its first battery . Nothing really caused the death ; it worked when I put it in the drawer , and not when I took it out a few months later . It still looks brand new . Anyway .... there are better VOMs out there for under $ 10 .
4 #### I put these on my SG and these Ernie Ball 7 - String Super Slinky Nickel Wound Set , .009 - .052 , feel much better than those I replaced , ca n't say what they were before , but I am happier now with these Ernie Balls .
4 #### This bag is great for keeping the trash together in one spot in the car . Before I got it I would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks , which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor . This handles that pretty well . Couple cons though , it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly ( make sure to check out the dimensions ) , and it is not always easy to empty out . The velcro does hold the bottom closed very well , just if it is really full , you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it . This is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor , and I am very happy with the purchase .
4 #### Heavier than the standard one , just wish it was in a set that included the end portion . I am glad I ordered these instead of the lighter version .
2 #### This cable is not the name brand they are advertising on AMAZON . It is a cheaper knockoff that is probably made in China . I am sure this cable will do just what it is supposed to do but when the picture is not the same as what i received , when the post is false the advertising is false and they should be looked at by Amazon and removed from their site as a service if they continue to be this shady of a company selling on the Amazon Site .
5 #### Great plan for the price ! Those who use their cell phones with economy , this is for you ! Especially when Tracfone offer a double or triple minutes for the life of most of their cell phones .
5 #### The fact that these stand quickly fold and fit into the bell of the horn is ingenious ! It saves room in your instrument case or fits in your gig bag as well . They are also extremely well built and affordable .
5 #### works great on our bicycle rides in the country where no cell reception
1 #### Better late than never with my review I guess . You get what you pay . The price was cheap but the picture quality was very poor . Even in bright outdoor situations , the pictures were under exposed and grainy . Really disappointed with this and we ended up buying a new camera soon afterwards .
5 #### I have one in every room . I use to plug things into a power strip until I found this affordable surge protector . Love the slim profile of the plug that goes into the wall outlet .
4 #### I 'm sure glad that I bought these straps , there not leather but are put together very well . I plan on using them as backups in the studio . The price was just right , cam quickly and I 'd buy them again .
4 #### sounds good in the neck position of my ES335 copy , could be a little brighter . I wrote that awhile back and am adding here . I bought the pickup for around 90.00 the current prices are outrageous ! Anyway , I decided to change the wiring from 2 to 4 conductor so I could do series /parallel and coil splits . Now the guitar is what I want ! Also changed cap values to .022 bridge .017 neck . And 50s wiring . This is the ticket I do n't think I could improve on this guitar , I am going to wire my 2014 Les Paul the same way . Also had to reverse a magnet to get what I wanted . No hum at all with both pickups on and in single coil mode . Sounds very good . Hit a couple switches and back to hi gain overdrive AC / DC heaven . Then back to clean jingle jangle country . It does it all now . Took a lot of research to figure out the wiring scheme .
5 #### Great large stands . Very stable . Love the secondary locking mechanism . Just an added sense of security when I 'm under a piece of machinary or truck .
5 #### I was looking for headphone with high fidelity , and surprise ... I Got it at a reasonable price , Its the best I ever buy
4 #### unit was preset to 3psi so I did n't make any adjustments yet . mounting bracket design could be improved , screws rub against body of regulator
5 #### Using this adaptor to power up my crybaby wah and it is working very well . I 'm sure it will save me a ton in battery costs over the years . Good quality i am pleased .
5 #### These replace the original sealed beam bulbs . They accept the modern style halogen headlight bulbs . They seem brighter than the old sealed beams , even though those were halogen too . The lens does not protrude outward as much as sealed beams . I 'm running them in my 1982 VW Vanagon camper .
5 #### Heard about this air filter from a friend that pulls a travel trailer often . I had to try it and see for myself . I often pull either a 24 ft gooseneck low boy trailer or a 28 ft enclosed cargo trailer . We use these on our youth hunts all over Texas . So far I notice I do n't have that hesitant stall when when I pass .
4 #### Officially , I do n't know about guitar strings . Best , worse . Just buy a name brand . Martin makes a pretty descent guitar , so I 'm guessing strings are just as good . no tinny reverb sound . just a clear tone
3 #### Yes ... this battery does connect to my ipad and my verizon mifi ... however ... it 's an advertising stretch to say it charges them in the same way the factory chargers do ... Since there are no tech specs , I would guess this is only a 1amp battery ... It will charge ipod and droidx ok ...
5 #### These strings bring out both the highs and lows in my guitar . They give the sound of the guitars I hear on recordings . The light gage cut through the band " noise " very well with plenty of volume . I 've played mediums for years but the lights improve both sound and volume on my guitar
5 #### I 'm adding a few things to both my kids Mexican Strats(MIM)and thought these would be a nice addition . Since the Mex Strat has the stamped tree there is only a hole for the screw . The new tree has a nub next to the hole that sticks down , I 'm guessing to prevent it from rotating . I did n't want to drill a hole to accommodate the nub , so I ground it down the till it was very small . I left just a little bit of material sticking out . There was just enough so you could catch a finger nail on the nub left . That made it so the little bit left would press in the wood preventing the tree from rotating when you screw it down . I looked on the web and the direction the tree should face . Near as I can figure it goes in with the nub closer to the tuner keys .
4 #### This is a distortion pedal . It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl . It 's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion . The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp . You can dial the tone in , but it 's a pretty harsh sounding . That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to . My amp gives me a nice warm crunch , classic rock style . The DS-1 gives me the 80 's metal and punk rock sound I wanted , and it does so flawlessly . It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1 . It 's BOSS , so it will last forever . Th only drawback is that it 's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere . Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing , but word to the wise , do n't pay more than $ 40 new for this thing .
5 #### Amazing Clarity ! I 'm all smiles . Been looking for sound like this for a long time . All these other headphones laying around here can go right in the trash . Update : I wore these on two 10 - hour train rides without a break , they were perfectly comfortable . I have a big head and they were / are not too tight , nor too hot on a warm train .
4 #### I would have gone 5 stars , but nothing can be perfect . Amazingly , this battery cost just a fraction of what the same one cost me a few years ago , but seems to be of the same high quality . When you 're out and about , it does n't hurt to carry a spare to keep you in touch with the world .
5 #### I have been daddario strings for years now .... still using them .....
5 #### Needed to hang lights from a square " T " . Perfect size and does what I needed .
5 #### Every so often the bristles on my cd / dvd cleaners go . This is one of the best ways I have found to clean laser - lens ' , especially for auto where the lens is enclosed . Allsop makes a reasonably priced and reliable cleaner . I have been using them for years .
5 #### I had another brand name Cold Air Intake ( CAI ) on my truck and it was getting up in age . Since it used a K&N filter , and I have used K&N Air and Oil filters for years , I decided to drop the extra coin for their version of the CAI . I was very impressed with the quality of the materials used and how well this was put together . Installation took me a little longer to accomplish because I had to take the upper radiator fan shield off to complete the installation . I also had to use my heat gun on the rubber gasket and the nylon couplers because it was 33 degrees outside and about 40 in my garage . Regardless , everything went together without a hitch . K&N really knows their stuff when it comes to air filters . BTW , I was installing this on a 2000 GMC Sierra RCSB 4X4 ( 4.8L ) and I did not need to trim anything from the rubber gasket . I would still recommend a heat gun or letting it sit out in the sun ( depending on the outside temperature ) before you install the rubber gasket . It just makes it pliable and easy to work with . Great product and well worth the extra $ $ $ $ I spent . Thanks K&N and Amazon !
5 #### If you have a 50 dollar budget for headphones . Stop looking . Add to cart and buy . I 'd heard a lot about these throughout my internet travels , and finally had to give in and try them out . I 'm so glad I did . The sound exceeds my more expensive , mid - level Klipsch Image One , and I kind of like the way they look too . I 'm serious , though . Do n't let the looks fool you , the PortaPros are performers ! If these are anywhere near your budget , just get them . Note : They 're not noise - isolating by any stretch , but the fidelity more than makes up for this .
5 #### Most of my instruments have the jack on the face , rather than the edge , and most of the cables I have are straight - straight , so the cable jutted out more than I wanted it to , which also adds a bit too much tug to the joint . The bent connector is the most obvious remedy . The cable is long enough for what I need it for , and it does n't seem to add any noise at all to the signal . The rubber on the cable feels nice as well , and the cords have a good bend to them , and resist tangling more than some cables I 've used . But I also do n't spend a lot of time turning around in circles to encourage it to tangle . I 'm really happy with this cable , and I 'd probably buy another if I did something awful to this one .
1 #### The green color is really cute . I bought it to replace a pink one that I bought at the AT&T store for much more money . However , the green case broke in the exact same places as indicated in the other users ' photos . This was within a couple weeks of getting it . What the heck ? Thank goodness Amazon has an amazing return policy . I was disappointed as the pink ifrogz case withstood a lot of abuse from my toddler .
4 #### Ok flute for the price . Good to teach basic music theory . Very hard to learn how to play .
5 #### Joined with the Apple firewire - to - thunderbolt adapter , this cable succeeded connecting my Sony HVR - V1N camera to both my iMac and Macbook Pro Retina 15 " , to capture both DV and HDV formats . This was a " cross - my - fingers " decision to buy , but luckily succeeded .
5 #### I build solid body electric guitars professionally and have played for over 50 years - so I know guitar strings . I always use Elixir strings on my personal acoustics . They are a superior quality product - worth the extra cost . They last much longer and retain their tone well beyond regular strings . .
3 #### it may work but it does nt work for what I ordered it for I have nothing else to test it on so i m not sure which is faulty
5 #### Arrived on time and as described . Typical K&N product .... does exactly what it says it will . Highly recommended .
5 #### We were able to fix the frig in the camper rather than replace it . Saved us hundreds of dollars .
5 #### Strong solid construction with heavy gauge wire . Cheap price , very happy the product . About 6 - 9 inches in length end to end .
5 #### Use it on automotive underbodies , in areas that do n't experience direct impingement of water or other substances from wheel rotation , that have light rust that I do n't feel like prepping for paint . Handy to use and dries to a slightly tacky non - messy film .
3 #### es very clear , good night vision , great price and nice look . its very easy to install and to see from the distance
4 #### I decided to try some flat - wound strings on my Carvin bass , having liked the feel and sound of flatwounds that I have used on my other two , less expensive basses . The Rotosound 77 Jazz Bass strings have the classic flat - wound feel ; however , the bright ping in the sound suggests round - wound strings . Right from the get - go these strings hold their tuning incredibly well and produce quite a lot of sustain . It was a little annoyed by the metallic dust that came off the strings when I first took them out of the individual paper sleeves , but this might have been a result of the third - party Amazon retailer having had them in stock for some time . Once I cleaned them off , though , I 'm happy with the feel , sustain , and especially the intonation . Unfortunately , I really was looking more for the sound of LaBella Deep Talkin ' Bass flat - wound strings -- the Rotosounds decidedly are not deep and dark sounding . So , take the product description to heart : these are bright - sounding strings and probably are perfect for the player who wants the round - wound sound with the feel of flats . Certainly , they seem less compromising than ground or semi - round strings .
5 #### This is working great for my church , and what a savings ! Do n't hesitate to buy these for your application . It 's great !
5 #### I was amazed at the quality of the sound from these inexpensive headphones . Even the bass is decent . They are also comfortable to wear .
4 #### Like others it needs more notches as it is about an inch in between and when rolling truck onto a life you have to squeeze them in , Still all in all for the price it is a good buy
5 #### Bearing packer is made out of plastic very economical and it works very well it has a socket head underneath so you can put it in a vice . I have only used it on four bearings but it does the job as I expected without me getting my hands full of Grease !
5 #### I used Powerstroke 3 's for years before discovering the SKII . This head sounds amazing . No need for extra muffling when using this head . It 's also very durable .
3 #### The On Stage GS7465 Guitar Stand is a good idea that falls short in the quality department . I was looking for another nice stable stand to safely hold my Telecaster & my Strat ( I already own an Ultimate GS100 stand - which I like very much ) . I also like that it could apparently also easily hold my acoustic Epiphone . Unfortunately when I opened the package I was underwhelmed by the build quality , but the worst flaw was that some on the padding was already worn off of the cradle right about where the front edge of both my Tele & Strat would sit on this stand . Not wanting my guitars to suffer ' battle scars ' due to a poor quality stand , I returned it immediately . I will order an Ultimate GS200 , as I am very pleased with their quality . I was hoping these stands were built as well because I really like the stable legs on them , but I would n't take the change of one damaging my guitars .
5 #### While aH , watts , etc are important ..... it really boils down to how efficient a fan is at those figures . I have one fan that only uses .5 amps on high ; however , it moves very little air , even on high . The Fantastic Fan puts out far more air ( cfm ) than any fan I 've ever used . You ca n't compare fans simply by how much power they use . My camper has been solar powered for 14 years and I do pay close attention to amp draw , but efficiency is critical to me . I would n't even think about using battery power without a way to replenish the battery ..... well , maybe for a weekend . You can set up a 50w solar system for under $ 100 and replenish .
5 #### Some of the best picks you can get and they last a long time too !
1 #### Pretty disappointed in Bushnell . I only ordered these because of a special promotion where they rebated the $ 20 . I filed the rebate to the letter and sent them my Amazon invoice . They would not honor the rebate however because they required a " receipt " . I refiled the rebate explaining that Amazon does not provide typical receipts and printed out the order confirmation and invoice and re - sent them again . Notta ! The binoculars are what you would expect for the price .
3 #### there 's not much choice for vhs tapes now , I 'm happy I can still find them on Amazon . I would give this a better rating if one of the tapes had n't had a broken piece internally , I could hear it rattling and when I took the tape apart there was a piece snapped off . but they were cheap enough that I did n't bother to return the package .
5 #### Great stuff - if your check engine light comes on , put a can of this in the gas tank and see if it does n't fix whatever ailed the engine . First I replaced all spark plugs . Next I replaced all spark plug wires . Then I started to replace every coil - 6 @ $ 50 each - when someone said try this product . A can into the gas tank fixed the problem and the check engine light went off after a few starts . I guess I could have saved a bunch of money if I had just put this in first .
5 #### I play an old ( 1971 ) Gibson SG standard electric guitar . I tried the D'Addario 9.5 super light plus guitar strings about a year ago and am please to say with great results . I play classic Jazz tunes , viz : Misty , Autumn leaves , the girl from Ipanema , etc . , etc . and found these strings perform very well . Also good for playing classic rock tunes , Hendrix , Santana , Frampton and may others . The strings give you better bending notes capability since they are a little thinner than 10 's but thicker than 9 's . However , depending on how often you play determines how long the string holds their clarity . I do play a lot so the strings last me about 2(two ) months on average . I would recommend these strings to any devout players .
5 #### I 'm a network administrator for a software company , so I did n't expect to have any problems setting up this unit . After a quick glance at the instructions ( which seemed a little scant , but certainly passable ) I was pluggin ' and goin' . I was able to download a newer version of the firmware ( the code that runs the unit ) and configured everything in about 10 minutes . Could n't ask for more , setup - wise . Perfect ! Linksys did include some " glossy " feature - pages regarding PPPoE hookup ( for DSL users ) and such . These seemed much more recent and much more user - friendly than the main instruction book . Perhaps they will revise all of the documentation to look this good . After installation , I actually found that this router improved my DSL performance ! Removing my PPPoE software ( terrible EnterNet 300 , yuck ) and my firewall software ( wonderful ZoneAlarm , I 'll miss that great interface ) took out some major processor overhead . For performance junkies like myself , I certainly * highly * this unit . Big time ! In conclusion , setup and installation rate about a 4 ( out of 5 ) . Easy , but I 'm not the best judge of that due to my experience . Performance and support , an easy 5 . Go Linksys go !
1 #### These stings do not keep tune well even after stretching and feel harsher than non coated strings . Coating also begins to peel off within the first couple days leaving frayed bits of plastic on the strings ....
5 #### I got this cowbell to let a ' lucky audience ' member play when our band is playing that song that makes everyone want more cowbell . This cowbell has a nice full sound , great tone and is a must for any band that is looking for some audience participation .
5 #### Ca n't really review the unit . It was a gift to my grandson for his boy scout bird watching . Tho I have n't used them , he tells me that they work well .
1 #### I was very excited to upgrade my OEM brake / parking in my vehicle . After changing one bulb at a time and viewing the image on my white garage door , I determined that I was mislead with this purchase . Sure , this bulb has more wattage than the OEM ( 5/21 Watt ) with the PIAA at ( 8/27 Watt ) . The bulb is covered deeply with blue paint and although it illuminates a whiter color , is is not as bright as the OEM bulb , thus a waste of money . I would not recommend this product .
3 #### The phone has a very nice print and I received alot of compliments , however , the print started to peel off too soon and after a couple of months the cover was practical white ... no more print . I was dissappointed .
4 #### We had the CD books inserted behind the CD , which makes it very bulky , but contain more . Better to use 1/2 the capacity , and place them one next to the other , if you can afford the space . The book is large and well made . Personaly I would prefer such a thick book to be harder cover , with ' O ' ring binder , which it is n't . The pages are binded to the cover so you can not move pages around , but rather have to move the disks . It is harder to alphabetize and add CD 's this way . Bottom line , a good , well built basic product .
5 #### Great product ! Beautifully constructed . Fast shipping . However , a bit too bulky for belt wearing . So I clipped to my ' deployment bag ' to hold small objects . And , the deployment bag , ( different company ) was just a few dollars more than the Maxpedition Cell Phone Holster . My recommendation is to do your homework .
5 #### The Sunpro mini tach was a great purchase . It works great and as far as I can tell has absolutely no noticeable delay in the gauge movement . Quick needle , and accurate as compared to rpm measured with a timing light . Back - lit display works well . I mounted on the column ; the only thing I would change about it would be an adjustable radius mount , but hey - for its price , it 's unbeatable . I love it .
5 #### Belkin is a classy company indeed . I am frequently plugging and unplugging my laptop from this cable and the tab that keeps the wire in the R-45 jack broke off after about 6 months of heavy use . Went to their website , put a claim in and they mailed me out a new one the next day , no questions asked . Sweet . UPDATE 8/08 Belkin now makes a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/50FT - CAT6 - Black - Patch - Cable - Snagless - RJ45M - RJ45M / dp / B000CNBQAS / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">50FT CAT6 Black Patch Cable Snagless RJ45M / RJ45M</a>&nbsp;that is better made , transmits data faster and supports 1000 MBps networks and probably best of all is cheaper .
5 #### This is a great product to soak in cold water and used to cool down very hot dogs . Holds the cold water well and allows it to transfer cooling relief to the dog . Also use to wipe down ears and foot pads and under the rear legs . ( Please do n't just drape it over the dog and leave it there as it will act as insulation and trap the heat in . )
5 #### The transmission on my Jeep Grand Cherokee has an issue where it will shudder in reverse ( & only reverse ) . I was skeptical about trying this , but this product does really work . I will say that the anti - shudder effect did wear off after a couple of months , at which point another treatment was needed . Still , the 2nd treatment is inexpensive and once again got rid of the shudder ( for how long , not sure yet ) .. I recommend giving this a shot if you are experiencing a transmission shudder .
5 #### The legend does not disappoint . I had a pair for about 12 years , sold them & missed them so here we go again . Changed the pads for brainwavz hm5 ones so I can skype , game & watch movies for hours on my days off .
5 #### Cheaper than buying a new car , the car is just fine given we only drive it to nearby stores once a week -- but a road trip forced me to consider my options for in car entertainment . The one cigarette outlet was NOT going to do the job , so I found this and OMG ... love it like who 'd have guessed . Not only did it plug and charge the GPS , but also the cell phones . The USB ports DID recharge my iPad2 fine too , despite some reviews that said it did not . Happy iPad recharged just fine , as did my iHome speakers and iPod .
2 #### They are okay , what could I expect for under ten - bucks ? ! I have an old set of Headphones which I have to use a twisty - tie to hold down the button , I would rather still use them , at least the sound is clearer , and I get a decent Bass . These , are only good to take up space in the trash - can .
5 #### Already had the iGo charger but needed a different tip when I got a new phone . This worked great with the Motorola Droid .
5 #### Great price for these as I have to replace headphones often for my kids . So often the wires in headphones are so cheap the only last a few months . After reading a lot of reviews I chose these and the first pair lasted for over a year so I bought a few more .
3 #### I have tried 3 bottles and have n't noticed a difference using this in my jeep 4.0
5 #### best strings I ve ever had . this things last for ever . I have 7 carvin guitars and I take a long time to pick a different guitar . Depends on the tunning or style of music I am working on and the strings stay in tune and also new . Tho I do clean them up ones I am done playing the guitar without fail .
4 #### good details and pics , good to have in any garage !
5 #### Previously have only used dunlop picks but tried these out on a whim . They actually look really nice and are perfect for strumming and solos .
4 #### Everything I needed in one tool , only complaint is that it 's awkward to use the winder with the bulky handle .
5 #### just screw these sleeves on your cymbals stands and you have your precious cymbals perfectly protected . these sleeves are made of hard plastic ans last for ever . no buzzing noise anymore when recording or miking the set , just perfect and cheap .
5 #### Terrific All - in - One Must - Have Tool for Guitarists ! I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder / cutter / bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model . I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk . I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking , bending , becoming dull or unusable . They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case . Buy , you 'll love it , and if not , you can always return it . Hope this helps !
1 #### I was looking for a 5 - terminal relay because I need the 87a terminal to switch something off versus switching it on . This is listed with a 5 - wire harness and I foolishly thought it was a 5 - terminal relay and it was not . I am sending it back .
5 #### This thing works great , I 've used a lot of different muffle systems over the years and this one is the best , to me .
5 #### I really love this bag . It holds everything and is really heavy duty . I have a canon 20 D , 30D , two ex 580II 's , canon 70 - 200 2.8 L , canon 24 - 70 2.8 L , 50 mm 1.8 , sekonic meter , all my owners manuals , notebook , tons of extra batteries and chargers , rain jacket , 4 CF cards , with room to spare . At one time , I also carried my holga too . Highly recommended .
5 #### I 've used these on many cars over the last 4 - 5 decades . They give the wheel a much better feel than the slick smooth plastic , and let you grip the wheel without applying too much force . I 'm picky about how I sew it on , so it took a bit over an hour , but once on properly , it 's on for good . Made a big feel difference on a car without power steering !
5 #### Its cheaper than buying a new light , and it works great ! have not had an issue . Has good range , and only works at night , it that is what you want .
5 #### I 've used these several times for a while now , and they 're very good . It does NOT pay to have jumper cables any LESS beefy than 6 gauge , and these 4 gauge ones never let me down .
4 #### This is an excellent unit and does what it 's supposed to do . Makes it easy to shut off several circuits at once . I like it .
5 #### This amp pushes two 12 " subs just perfect . any more would be too much but I am no longer the BASSHEAD I used to be ! ! !
5 #### used these for the kids while travelling . much easier to use than earbuds for the smaller children . it does n't break the bank either so replacement is n't an issue if the kids break them .
5 #### Wife can now get in the truck with little effort .
5 #### Works well . I leave it in a plastic zip - lock bag when not in use . Better than putting a finger full of grease in your palm and working the bearing across your palm to get the grease inside the bearings .
5 #### I have used this product many times . This is just another order . It 's a great rust preventer when applied according to instructions ( clean surface and TWO coats of Rust Bullet . )
5 #### This Capo looks great and does the job . It does take a bit of pressure to open the camp , but its better then the winding versions .
5 #### I ordered this for my Jackson DKMG . This is my 1st Gator case , and I 'm very pleased with it . It is similar to SKB and fits my guitar very nicely . Being lightweight is a big plus as well , and also the secure feeling of having a HSC . I will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it . Just remember that this model is for standard type axes ; Strats , Teles and such .
5 #### This mount worked very well . Assembly was quick and fit perfectly on my 42.inch display . The price is impossible to beat .
5 #### very happy ... actually surprised at the quality of the headset ! Received this before the actual delivery date ! Thank you !
5 #### Great Buy ! ! ! Just what I want for a Christmas Gift
5 #### installed on 2012 toyota tacoma just perfect not to loud saves gas also nice sound priced affordable would highly recommend
5 #### This is the lens I leave on my camera for general purpose use . At non - macro focus distances , it is a very fast lens in a convenient short - telephoto length . The images are sharp out to the corners . This is one of those great Canon lenses that probably deserves an L - series rating but is available without the red stripe and exorbitant cost . Tested in an astrophotography context ( point sources on black backgrounds - excellent for revealing aberration and coma ) , I have found that this lens is reasonably sharp at f/4 and completely sharp by f/5.6 . For daylight terrestrial photography , the tiny aberrations caused by the wide - open f/2.8 aperture are hardy noticeable and by f/4 the images are exquisitely sharp . There is a lot of glass in this lens - it is heavy . I highly recommend buying the tripod collar as it allows you to attach the camera and lens to a tripod or ballhead with much better balance . Also , if you plan on using the macro functionality , keep in mind that the effective f - stop of the lens goes way up when you 're focusing at very close range . At 15 cm from the front surface , it performs as though it were an f/9 . You 'll either want a lot of light or a very steady subject and a good tripod ( another reason to buy the hideously overpriced tripod collar ) .
5 #### This is a great product , it does exactly what it 's supposed to do , at a reasonable price , with an easy interface . But I think people need to understand that this is n't a box of answers . It 's a diagnostic tool . I was a professional automotive technician , I grew up working on cars , and I received a formal education in automotive technologies . The OBDII system is pretty complex , and can point you in the wrong direction . This is in no way the end - all be - all car diagnostic machine , but it 's pretty dang useful to have in the tool box . For the price I paid I got exactly what I was looking for .
5 #### I always buy Ernie ball . However , I own a 6 string . Totally was n't paying attention and by the time I realized , it was too late .
5 #### I needed this for my Gibson Johnny Smith , which has a 1/8th inch connection at the guitar . It is what is is . I 've had no problem with it .
5 #### For about $ 10 I was not expecting much . I thought I would start out with this one , if it did n't work , what the heck . I already had a more expensive , well - rated product picked out , if it did n't work . Plugged it in , and BAM ! music , coming loud and clear from the ipod through the car stereo ... GOOD sound , too . YAY ! I could n't get the remote to work , but who cares ? ! The ipod sits close to the driver 's seat . The clamp is good , it will even hold our Nano . I have not tried it driving around a city , but I ca n't imagine the reception would be affected too much . I may never leave the car again . :)
1 #### Not usable as i have a protector on my phone and it wo n't fit into this device . Should have been made wider . I do n't recommend .
1 #### I highly recommend NOT getting this unit . The Garmin unit does n't work well enough to do anything with . I 'm up high on a mountain with great sky coverage , lots of satellite lock in , awful inaccuracy . Waste of money .
5 #### Exactly as described . Lite weight ! LOVE IT ! Wish I had one in every color . Very practical . Did not want something bulky but still protects the phone .
1 #### SUCKED I could n't hear it when talking I would not purchase this if I was U ! I did return it
5 #### It is a good stand , not too heavy or too light . Being in a wheelchair it is easy to maneuver .
1 #### Do nt bother the older model if you can find it is 100 % better . They tried to improve the looks only however failed to use the same tech on the new one
5 #### We needed a pair of small binoculars for shows and other events . These appear to be decent . Good magnification with minimum distortion . While there are models with more magnification you have to keep in mind that with higher magnification comes more problems with distortion when you ca n't hold the binoculars steady . This model is a very goo compromise . Comes with a reasonable storage case and appears to be well constructed .
4 #### Good quality , easy to install but keep a couple o bubbles near the buttons , have tried en 2 differnts cellphones ans the same issue .
1 #### Do n't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back . What I mean by that is that when your on the phone , the other party hears an echo . This happend on all the calls . The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box ! I do n't recomend wasting your money on this . One you may try that has worked for me is the H500 . Cheap looks ok and best of all , it works ! ! ! ! Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3 .
5 #### Perfect fit for my ESP Baritone Viper . I tune down to B and some times A and the notes still cut through with clarity . So I 'm satisfied . I 'm sure these will be the go to strings for that guitar for now on .
5 #### these headphones not only isolate great , but they sound great , and they feel good . the music comes very clear over these things . they have above average detail , above average instrument seperation and above average clarity they also have above average highs and mids , and lows . the sound stage is average , but that s expected from a pair of closed monitors . i own a pair of senn hd598 , so most headphones sound mediocre compared to them , but these girls actually compete ! not only do they do their job great , but they also sound great !
5 #### I was a little leery about this cable , because of the price vs. length . Guess what , it has been working GREAT ! I 've used it a number of times in recording sessions that spanned through the whole house and am very pleased with it . Feel confident buying this cable .
3 #### nice extra bling first one came broken called them and replacement was here in three days no problem nice
5 #### this is the best phone i ve bought so far . i like that a lady says the person name on all incoming calls and recite the numbers as i m dialing , i do n't have to go into contact information to dial a contact other phone number , the picture quality is good . I m not addicted to phones , i m hapy as long as i m able to be reached so features are n't important to me but after buying this phone i m beginning to like extras . I was also able to buy a pink rhinestone cover case for this model , i can continue to say sweet things about this phone but do n't want to go on and on so just know i like it !
5 #### Still works for me . I like it light . Light touch . Change strings often . Best price . A little cheaper then retail .
4 #### This is my first purchase of rain - x. It seems to work pretty well . I do wish it lasted longer . A few weeks after application it seems to be wearing off unevenly . Also it was difficult to get a good buffing on the windshield after the first application . Once it rained the wipers seemed to even it out though .
4 #### ... with a name like " SportaPro " I assumed they 'd be pretty good for , you know , sporty things , like jogging . When in behind - the - neck position , they tend to drift a bit . You have to get the band EXACTLY right , since that 's the only thing holding them up - the band resting on your neck . Also , I 'm not saying these things need a manual , but a small piece of paper with little arrows showing which way the things can fold on the headphones will be nice . They 're a lot more adjustable than most headphones , but it 's not immediately obvious . For the price , they sound really good . Despite the drift I 've been using them for over a year and have no plans on switching .
5 #### It works great , I have not managed fill it up yet but there is still time .
5 #### I bout these cards there a good brand and i can use it when i need to use it.i hate to bother you all but can you pray for my cat pooky she s ill and could die but pray for her to live.we have no extra money for the vet.thanks albert .
4 #### I purchased this for use with my old Canon Rebel XTI . It works great , and I love the shutter lock function for long exposures .
2 #### This thing is huge . I could n't find a suitable mounting location for it so I returned it for a traditional style trickle charger .
5 #### Thanks Amazon for a great half off deal . These little guys are pure quality .
3 #### It works good for the price paid , and helped me find a leak in my tractor 's A / C. I wish it was a bit easier to use , but after reading the directions a couple times , it finally made sense . 4 star product , good value for the price , but I knocked it down a star , for the sketchy instructions .
5 #### I like these pics . I use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin . good for fast strumming , etc . they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto . I would buy them again .
5 #### I generally like Snarling Dogs picks for sound , durability , and grip . I prefer the S.D. green for acoustic guitar and red for electric . When not using just my fingers , I also like a rubberized pick for ukulele and sometimes for acoustic or bass . I bought the Dunlop Jazz III picks as an Amazon ( filleritem.com ) filler item . It takes a small adjustment to adapt to their smaller size but I find that I do prefer their sound ( or dampened pick noise ) for jazzy Strat playing in my DACFGC tuning more than Snarling Dogs . I guess that the black color is popular but it is harder to see if you drop it . Nonetheless , these picks have a decent grip , enable a sound appropriate to their name , and they are inexpensive as a filler item .
5 #### made a trip to tennessee and i wanted to be able to put up a map on my phone.so i bought this . ends up i love this thing . i use it for music , hands free phone through the car speakers ( awesome)using the included mp3 cable plugged into my radio , charging , maps , gps , speed at which i am traveling without lowering my eyes and also easier to read that the cars spedo , if someone texts me i can glance at it and see what it is with out touching anything or lowering my eyes . push microphone icon the say " call so - and so " and it does . suction cup works very well on the windshield . i am using it with a droid 2 and there is a removable spacer for the original droid to fit on . i see others had charging troubles . mine works flawlessly . i am using the car charger that came with my phone and is plugged into the rear of this mount . i can be playing music and have my gps spedo on and still charges my phone so i do not understand their comments .
5 #### This is a greatcar product for all cars to keep all running better , get your K&N filter to go with it
1 #### The shape of the mini usb is not right , it comes off easily , one tiny touch disconnects it from the phone . I often wake up in the morning with no power on my phone because it needs to be attached tightly and not a single movement . If you even put it down on the table after you connect it , it will stop working , I have to set my phone down and plug it in really hard .
3 #### This is ok to have around the garage - gives basic information , but lacks content for the Gen II MINI . I 've had other Haynes manuals , but none were as lacking as this one
3 #### I ca n't argue that the dimensions were available , but it seemed as though it would be large enough for a day outing with a camera and an extra lens . Not so . My 50D , battery grip , 17 - 55 lens nearly filled the space . I was not able to add another lens in the bag while the camera was in it . A flash would fit in the remaining space , and some small items such as batteries , filters , and the like . It 's a sturdy little bag , and I think it will serve some use as an accessory bag ( with a couple of smaller lenses - forget a large zoom ) if I do n't put a camera in it . I like the construction , etc . , and will keep it - perhaps also purchase a larger bag from Lowepro . I certainly can not fault their quality .
5 #### AWESOME!!!!!!I have these on my 94 FORD f 250 4x4 with a 3000 lb camper & pull a trailer with 3900 lb jeep .... I could n't get the trailer lack wheel out because sag from the camper ... I had them installed at " CAMPING WORLD " install special ! ! ! ! ! This did the trick ! ! ! ! ! Looking at all air lift systems out there this is the best bang for your buck ! ! ! ! ! I also had this setup on a FORD RANGER when I needed lift go a small but heavy toung weight ..... AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
5 #### Christmas gift , he said it seems to go out of tune some but he loves it .
5 #### Got 3 years of hard use out of the old one , I full time camp in New England . Very satisfied
5 #### Good Deal , works well . Great for timed exposures ! Would highly recommend it if you do slow exposure pictures .
4 #### Great clamp for smaller light fixtures . I 've seen it for less locally . Anyway , I 'm loyal to Chauvet .
3 #### The mute itself is very nicely made , however the cork stays are not adhered very well and fall off .. When I received the mute one of the cork stays was just hanging on . A bit of rubber cement fixed the problem and now I have no issues with the mute . As far as the performance of the mute it works wonderfully and would not hesitate to buy it again if I needed but keeping in mind the cork may need to be adhered better .
5 #### a must have to save your hearing and practicing in front of the TV . the grey side is good rubber and bounces similar to a drum . the black side is noisy and feels like playing on a counter top you can play on a cutting board for the same feel . i really do n't like it for any purpose .
5 #### It fits and works well , it 's the original Brother m tape 1/2 " . No problems , works just fine , you 'll like it .
5 #### Fit perfectly on my 4 cylinder 3.0 Mercruiser inboard / outboard .
5 #### I have the older version of this charger , which is a little larger and holds slightly less charge . I absolutely love this thing . I ca n't tell you often it 's gotten my phone through a long day , either when I 'm traveling or just out for the day and unable to get to a wall outlet . This battery can charge my phone three times ( your mileage may vary ) and I 've also used it on flights for my ipad . Definitely a must have item if you 'd be lost without your phone ! The only warning I 'd give is that the battery tends to get hot . I imagine that 's typical of all such devices but since I 've never heard another , I really ca n't say . It 's not so hot that it seems dangerous , but I do try to make sure that it has some breathing room while charging so it does n't overheat .
1 #### I do n't know why I bought this tablet , just only one day using it and I stored it in a place where it continues stored ... I do n't like the screen ... it reflects light from many sources ( sun , bulbs , etc ) despite the type of technology used in the screen ... the size is no convenient , I think a bigger one good be better ... well , this is my opinion about this product ...
4 #### I had read a couple of reviews that mentioned the jack did n't come with a handle , which did n't concern me much as I could easily make one but alas the 8ton jack had a handle included . Worked fine this weekend for it 's first use and is currently holding up an axle . Will be using it in the next couple of weeks to pull two engines and install one . Will update with any issues should they arise .
3 #### Phone seems great but battery was no good , and Amazon was quick to give me a credit , and I ordered a replacement and all was well
4 #### So that it works universally , you will need to purchase a lug nut that it will cover . The cap lugs that are standard on our boat trailer were not compatible . A quick trip to NAPA , Pep Boys , etc . and the spare on my boat trailer is locked . As is the case with any lock , a motivated thief will get past this , but as a deterrent , it is certainly satisfactory .
5 #### They just sent this to me . Worked as expected . Do n't know what else to say to get this review above 20 words . Did n't use internet on that phone , so 2 G to 3 G did n't make a difference to me . AT&Ts coverage was so good .
5 #### These were just what I wanted ... for playing my keyboard late at night . Very high quality , especially for the price . Would highly recommend .
5 #### The length is perfect for the printers that I needed to connect , the cables are well build and they arrived sooner than expected
5 #### good quality easy to hook up light is very bright fit perfect .
5 #### This is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne . The only issue I have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly , allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post ( not a big deal ) .
5 #### Good quality good price ca n't ask for anything more . I usually break or lose a set of these every 3 yrs so the price is right . Used for hunting and sporting events
4 #### It might even be too big to mount in some small cars . It 's sturdy and holds the phone well . If you 're handy , you can eliminate the entire center arm for a holder that is sturdy and compact . It holds the phone well , and the holder is short enough to still use the camera .
5 #### I am quite a fickle - but very loyal - customer and when I find a product or service that meets my needs I work with it until the last bell tolls . I worked with this machine almost 20 years ago , and was so pleased with it that I put out an APB on it for use in our small home - base business . Imagine my delight when it popped up on Amazon.com at a most favorable price . I was so happy that bought it out right . Still going strong after all these years - and no , the Dictaphone is not obsolete by any definition of the word . What attracted me to this model was the fact that it carries both mini and standard cassettes , a counter , and the ability to set the number of words your pedal will present when you go fast forward or backward . Well worth the price I paid - and it 's still in use in my business , even after this may years .
5 #### Exactly what we needed as a back - up cable between our Canon Vixia and the HDMI input .
1 #### I purchased 3 of these through the seller WELLGOAL . Each had faulty and misaligned connectors , resulting in messed up audio . If you 've ever pulled your headphone plug out slightly , and only heard echoey background music without the vocals , it sounded like that . All 3 were also slightly different lengths ( bad quality control ? ) . The adapters did not work on the following devices : iPod Nano 4th Gen , Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 , iPod Touch 4th Gen , Kindle Fire HD . I contacted WELLGOAL for a refund , but they insisted these adapters were ONLY FOR iPHONE 3 G AND 3GS , and thus were not defective . If I wanted to return them , they said I had to pay for return shipping and restocking fees . I balked , and they offered me a 20 % refund if I simply kept them . I ended up doing that , as it was the cheapest option . But I will be avoiding WELLGOAL from here on out . Also - BEWARE of re - ordering an item from your past orders . I had initially purchased a similar item from X - eParts ( aka , eForCity ) , which worked GREAT with my devices . I wanted to order more of those . However , since the seller no longer carries the item , Amazon quietly shuffled me off to a different item with a different seller . That 's a little deceptive .
5 #### My main concern is the screen of my smart phone consumes too much energy . Well , with this product it 'll last my cell standby much longer when I 'm out of nowhere ! !
3 #### They both work fine . They do seem to get a little warm after a while . I am not sure what that means .
5 #### I had just purchased my first NXT ( 2.0 ) and several people recommended this book . I can see why ! it is a step - by - step introduction to the NXT , set up in exercises as if for a class , but totally usable by the individual user like me . I have been having a blast acheiving each step . This book is fun , and very clear . I am really enjoying my NXT more with it than I would have without !
2 #### Not bad for the price . I used these mirrors for a few months & they did serve thier purpose . My biggest complaint would be the vibration while driving making the viewing area hard to see . A bit scary while changing lanes on the interstate pulling a 30 ' travel trailer . I ended up purchasing the slide on CIPA mirrors that were made specifically for my vehicle wich are much better .
5 #### I did n't want to shell out much money for classroom headphones . These fit the kids well and sound good . I 'll be buying some more for home and the classroom .
5 #### I made the mistake of buying a slightly cheaper GE recorder , with horrible sound . The Sony is only a few dollars more and immensely better . Very good sound reproduction , even using only the internal mic . Automatic shutoff and a carrying handle are extra features which other low - price units do n't have .
5 #### Great guitar strings . Bought them to replace the strings on an old electric guitar . They have a great feel and can withstand a lot compared to others that I had bought before .
1 #### Do n't waste your money , even if it 's just a couple dollars . Read up , research , and you 'll see the folly of these things .
5 #### It 's been along time since i bought these and the bulbs are still going strong ..
5 #### This product works well , just be sure to blow off the excess . I used a leaf blower and that worked well .
5 #### This is a sturdy , last forever kind of grease gun that feels every bit like a professional tool . I bought it to service my F-250 , snow plow , and salt / sand spreader while living in Northern Virginia and it saved me huge bills by being able to do the work myself vice taking my equipment to a garage or shop . I 've used it for two seasons and the tip is still clamping on and attaching to the greas fittings very tightly .
5 #### Does what is it meant to do on a K&N Filter .
4 #### Easy to put on and take off . I like it because the case is flush with the bezel allowing a 3rd party screen protector to be used . I would recommend this .
4 #### The one on my " Green Earth " electric mower overheated , and this was a direct replacement for the one that overheated . NOTE : for the Green Earth mower that I have , I doubled the size of the heat sink ( the original one on the mower was pitiful ) . remember to use thermal compound between the rectifier and the heat sink .
4 #### Worked fine , was a little loose over the lugnut , a few wraps of some self - vulcanizing tape and all of the slack is gone .
5 #### It might not sound like much , but it makes a huge difference when placing MegaWarrior rack on a larger vehicle . It fits the truck better , and it allows you to hold more . Make sure to remember the load limit of both the roof rack , and the cross bars . Do n't over load it !
5 #### I got this as a birthday present for my sister and she loves it . She says it fits her iphone like a glove and has no complaints .
5 #### Product arrived on time and in good shape . This cord allowed me to easily connect an external DVD drive with a permanent - attached USB cord to my computer at the distance I needed .
5 #### One of the best Capos I 've tried . This Capo is easy to put on and re - position .
4 #### Pros : Sleek design , light weight . Cool laser pointer , LED light and 3 bar battery life indicator . I was able to get 2 full charges on my iPhone 4S. Decent battery for the price ! Recommendations : 1 ) Make body thinner to make it less bulky . 2 ) Shorten charging duration to 2 - 3 hrs or less if possible . 3 ) A nice to have : If battery is not totally off but in some powered down mode , have an auto shut down mode or different color indicator to let user know to turn off battery .
5 #### Needed a quality battery to replace the poor quality battery in my 1.5 million candle power carry - around light . Battery had exactly the same dimensions , the same connection tabs , etc . Works perfectly and it 's a safe bet this one will go the distance . Really glad I decided to save this light instead of throw it in the garbage . Need a battery of this sort ? Have no fear !
5 #### The sound of these strings is beautiful . They feel durable and they keep tone for a long time . I love the .013 gauge . It gives me a little more resonation too .
3 #### Did not work ; will not spin in order to clean my VCR . I was hoping the head cleaner would work .
4 #### Took me two tries but they work nicely . Not too short at all . Covers entire phone . Once applied , do not attempt to pull back up . Will ruin the protector and wo n't stick back down again without a bubble or 5 .
4 #### I bought this phone some days ago while visiting europe , and despite all the comments here about not being 3 G .. the true thing is that in fact it is . IT officially supports HSDPA 900/2100Mhz , bands that are mainly in use only in Europe , though I believe some US - based operators use that frequency as well . CONS : Up to android 2.1 , no support for the lastest GINGERBREAD . No plans to offer an upgrade either . Short battery life , specially if you are an intensive data - and - calling user . Does n't support skype . Although you can install it , the processor is too slow for the lastest release . No way making calls with it . Virtual keyboard : Does n't feel as accurate as the iPhone , but you can get used to it . It can become hot when you 're using intensive - processor tasks . You need to have a google account in order to take advantage of the phone . I do n't know if I feel that familiar sending all my data to google ...... PROS : Removable battery : It trully helps to keep one on spare Micro - USB charger : It 's becoming the standard , and I appreciate the fact that I do n't have to carry yet another charger ( the one from my blackberry works just fine ) Response time : usually very fast Small form - factor : I thought it would be bigger based on the images , but feels very comfy on hand .
5 #### It 's always good to have extra cables for your phone . Samsung is a little particular and pref that you use authentic Samsung cables with their devices .
3 #### Works but not great . Hangs up and jams machine but you can learn to be an expert the 2nd time around . Almost killed my newest DVR / VHS machine and patience and understanding got it unjammed .
3 #### This light goes from Mighty Bright at 3 inches over the page to " Not So Bright " when you get farther than that . The power of the beam diffuses very quickly . I will read by it if there is no other light source , bu t it is very strained and having to have the light so close to the page makes the head of the lamp continually get in the way . A decent product , but surely not great . I needed to buy a different flexible clip lamp .
5 #### These are nice . They keep the bass strings of 10 's with lighter strings on G , B , E strings . So my strat bends more like my Gibson with 10s . They sound nice too and I have n't broken a string yet .
4 #### Perfect for what I needed . See behind without turning around . Check on skier or tuber or to see approaching boat from rear . Clear enough for all that and secures tightly so no vibrations .
4 #### This is actually the first capo I have ever owned , as I am pretty new to playing the guitar . That being said , I paid close to $ 14 with free shipping for this capo , and I feel it is a good value . It feels well constructed , like it wo n't break if I drop it . The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings . Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar 's neck . The spring mechanism is plenty tight , but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed , even while playing . The capo is sleek looking , and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3 " x 3 " , but I have no frame of reference for comparison . Item was shipped on time , and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging . Part number : 83CB , Made in USA ! No counterfeit here . If you have any questions , feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can . Thanks for reading . SPO
1 #### Could n't get it to work , so , tried free Netgear customer support touted on box & instructions . Filled out all their forms , and then contacted them : ( a ) Chat - Support people just went away to check something , and * never * came back . ( b ) Phone - Support people did exactly the same thing , * * twice * * . I gave up and returned it .
4 #### Luckily my fianc&eacute ; had the Galaxy S5 , i ordered it for my Galaxy S5 Active . IT WILL NOT FIX THE GALAXY S5 ACTIVE . She loves it too bad i ended up ordering a replacement original battery instead for mine
5 #### Items arrived four days before expected time ; that 's excellent . The films are all in good shape and the expiration date is printed on the box . Easy buy .
5 #### solid stands ! tall enough and can certainly hold a truck
4 #### If you have a guitar over $ 500 , it 's definitely worth investing in some kind of humidifying tool . This fits the bill nicely , and the price is right . There are no fancy electronics , no timers or anything , so you 'll just need to check it the old fashioned way with your eyeballs and fingers . I 've been snagging distilled water from my bio lab and have n't had any gunky salt build up . I may invest in a gallon of DI water I found here on Amazon later , but for now it works . If you have a really high - end guitar , I 'd recommend getting something better like a humi - case with a built - in hygrometer and humidifier , but for the starting musician it works just fine .
5 #### Works really well used it on my convertible top and the interior of my cars leather . The top shined like new , the interior felt softer .
5 #### We live in a rural area in a mobile home and can get a signal standing out in the pasture on one leg holding our mouth just right ... LOL In the house , we would often have no signal at all or we would have to have our ear to the window facing south to be able to talk and then we still had a lot of static and cutting out . Once we installed this , the signal inside went to -61 ( -60 is supposed to be near perfect , or so I 've read online ) and my phone has a max of 4 bars and it is sitting at either 3 or all 4 most of the time now in most every room of the house . Even with an ice storm the last couple of days with high winds , we still have our signal ! YIPPEE ! I would highly recommend this booster !
5 #### Always Great to get the right size when a longer one is unnecessary and unmanageable . Belkin 's Products are very consistent in both quality and price . They hit it all with this one . We have used several of these at work .
5 #### Ca n't believe these are this cheap ! Great quality and have stood the test of travel for the last couple months !
4 #### Nice quality and great fit . All the openings ( Speaker , Home button ) are perfectly placed . Has a good matte finish to prevent glare and fingerprints .
4 #### nice black case and seems like quality leather . I bought it for an LG VN250 newer model . It 's a snug fit , but works .
5 #### great strings , been using these a while . These are heavier so not as easy to play but I nice deeper more mellow sound with some zip on the high end . I have playing a long time 35 + years so I know my strings . Played Rotosound forever but as a casual performer I was not playing 30 hours a week like I used to . These fit the bill perfectly for my pbass .... still have the lighter gauge for my jazz and the slappy funk stuff ....
5 #### This is a very nice and heavy duty Power - Center . The cord is thick and long so you should be able to reach an outlet . I like the labeling that lets you know which plugs are which . Very nice product .
1 #### I bought two sets about six months ago because they were cheap . While the sound is good , the fit is terrible . Both failed within four months -- likely due to stress on the cords . They also do n't have a volume control and they are not good for television watching , if that 's what you had in mind . I believe they are under warranty , but at this price , it 's not worth the postage to send them to Sony .
5 #### The sound champ of all headphones in my opinion . The folding nature of these headphones is great for travel and the sound produced by these headphones is unsurpassed , in my opinion . This is the third set of these I 've had over the last 20 years and I just love them .
5 #### These strings are great ! You can read reviews all day , but you really need to get some of these strings and give them a try ! I love them ! ! !
5 #### Great product . The remote works just as the shutter button does for excellent use with a tripod when you want to avoid camera shake . The remote is light yet well made .
5 #### Based on the reviews thought I 'd give this babe a try and boy have I been impressed ! I tried them with my iphone 3 and they sounded good . But , when I lost my iphone , I used my 30 GB Zune player that I got from my daughter as she got an Ipod and then I turned on the EQ setting . Man , I heard sounds I never heard before from a stereo or headphones ! ! The bass was awesome and I could hear the words much better ! ! Words I never knew what the singer was singing ! ! So folks , it depends on your player for some awesome sounding bass . I 'm not sure if there is EQ app for iphone , but I will check when I get my replacement in a couple of months or some other phone if there is an EQ on the phone ( doubt it , though may be surprised ) . There ear pad on my left ear hurt a little at first after a little while but I adjusted the head band so it took most of the weight on top of my head and that worked . Good luck in finding your headphones ! I found my babe .
5 #### I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable . I put a 1 gig memory card in it . Right now , I have a 140,000 word dictionary on it , the NIV bible , Star Wars , many videos of my son , about 100 wma songs , and a ton of pictures . It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts , appts , tasks , and emails are always up to date . It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset . It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy . The screen is absolutely gorgeous . The camera takes decent pictures and video . One of the best features is the battery life . For all it does it lasts an incredibly long time . I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price . I like it waaaay better than the treo , blackberries , Q , or any other qwerty device . It 's glued to my hip and I use it all the time . I love it ! ! !
5 #### Pleasant surprise to me is this is described as a brushed aluminum finish and it is not . The finish is as shown , and that is polished not brushed . I love the look of polished aluminum even though you have to give it a little extra care every now and again , but the polished look is cool to me . I suppose if you just had to have it brushed , you could do it yourself but eventually , if you ride with your hand on the shifter as I do , the handle will end up polished anyway . Also the wire on mine is black , which I like better , and the wires are copper and steel so polarity can be followed if need be . All in all I am very pleased with the item I received , about ten bucks cheaper than a Hurst model . Got to me a couple days early and that 's never a bad thing . Now after twenty - five years or so with a Hurst handle on my B&M shifter , I now have a B&M handle on my B&M shifter . Yay !
5 #### This fan put out a excellent breeze on very low amp draw . I dry camp most of the time in AZ and I find my solar panels can keep up a charge which in turn mean I 'm comfortable all the time .
5 #### Perfect fit for my 2000 F150 . Still looks good 2 + years later .
4 #### Ummm power so clean .... except do n't be on the same circuit as a light dimmer or fluorescent fixture that on .
5 #### ik ordered it after carefully researching it and when i got them and they snapped in the ethernet ports and stayed in so securely , not once do i have to check to see if they are falling out cause the snagless aspect works perfecly and i m a happy camper ! !
5 #### This cable is less noisy , with no annoying clicks and scratchy sounds when you move . It seems to reduce the hum as well and is flexible but not overly limp . The ends are secured well . One thing which wo n't matter to most people but does to me is that my cat , which has destroyed several power cords and cables , does n't like to chew on it due to its woven covering .
5 #### Pretty straight forward unit . Seems really high quality and tough . I have no worries about it .
5 #### Easy to use and I like the ability to set the torque adjustment for accurate torque .
5 #### 888 My guitar fits perfectly in this case ! And the price was good too ! Very happy with this purchase . Recommend it !
5 #### Highly recommended for anyone who has toddlers! .... or boys ! ! After spending tons of $ $ $ for replacement tv 's , I was told of this wonderful product ! It works well for the protection aspect , and looks great on !
5 #### This is my preferred guitar capo shape and I * love * that I can get it in purple !
2 #### Sounds ok , durability really sucks ... Just buy when there 's not Elixir or Earnie Ball available .
3 #### this is my second set after one year of used . The leather will peel off after 10 month . I watched you tube and learn how to do a double cross stitch ( like most current vehicle out there today ) . It looks good when new installed . I taking good care of my vehicle well but still peel off . I wished they offer a bit harder leather ( like on most sport car ) and will not peel .
4 #### I 've only had mine for a couple of days , but since I got it , I have n't used my TV tuner for anything . In those two days I 've had no serious glitches . I do notice the noise sometimes , but only in those rare moments when my apartment is totally quiet . When I 'm using it the noise is undetectable . I expected ( when I ordered it ) to mostly use the pause and commercial skip features , so I could watch TV on my own time table . Once I got a good feel for how it worked , my vision changed . Now I see it as a filter : I browse the program guide , pick shows I want , and let the Replay unit record them . When I have time to watch TV , instead of having to worry about what 's on right then , I just look at what the ReplayTV has saved lately . It 's cool . It 's addictive . And this is only the second generation of the product available to consumers . I can easily envision a time- say , in three years- when the recording capacity and video quality have improved enough to make these units as ubiquitous as the VCR .
4 #### Looks good , perfect as white elephant gift , anyone can use one of these !
5 #### This blanket works great . It does not get hot and is not meant to . But it puts out enough heat that it keeps my wife comfortable which is saying something , as she is always cold . I highly recommend it .
3 #### I wish they were n't made out of plastic , just be careful , one person who backs into your vehicle and there done .
5 #### works great , used the money I saved on this to buy a better antenna
5 #### We both really like this stand great for keeping several instruments off floor ! ! ! She picked it out easy assembly sturdy
3 #### I received this DC power adapter for my garmin etrex venture CX in high hopes it would work with my particular gps . It does not state it was n't incompatible and only says in the description that it is compatible with etrex venture models . And , lo and behold it is NOT compatible with ETREX VENTURE CX , you need a model with the cigarette to 5pin adapter . I did receive a blackberry from work which has one of those and it works great with my gps .
5 #### Not being a computer or camera " pro " I needed something easy to use . I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon . I decided to buy the F83 model . This model allows for a 15 second " movie " . Boy do I like it . I like the ease of the Floppy disk . The quality is fine for my needs . The battery lasts a long time . A camera bag is a necessity since the LCD screen marks easily . I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a digital camera that is easy to use . Thanks Amazon for providing the reviews , and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews . I found them very helpful .
5 #### i bought these a the px 100 's and girlfriend pick the px 100 's i got these , i like the style and the sound is a huge step up from the ipod in ear phones . i also dig the warranty that koss gives these . i have to admit the sound is a little more defined on the sennhiesers(how do you spell it ? ) but the difference is not worth quibbling over . you will be happy with either pair , but the px 100s stay in place on her head better ( i ve got a bigger dome ) so if you have a small head go for those .
5 #### All I need is a simple Ohmeter and this is exactly what I need ! I 'm a retired Electronics Engineer and I do n't need all the fancy equipment with all the bells and whistles ! Just a simple Ohmeter does just fine . this Elenco unit has performed just fine so far !
5 #### Well built and well priced , worked well in truck springs .
5 #### What more can be said , Ernie Ball guitar strings in a hybrid set . Easy to tune , long lasting and great sound .
1 #### I had bought two of these antennas because I thought they were sleek , too bad they barely worked 20 feet from the car . I ended up buying a little wil antenna that worked much better !
2 #### I did not like the the case pouch case . It was made of plastic not leather . Mr. R
5 #### Easy install and works great . If your mirrors are large like those on a van or truck , definitely go with the 3 - incher . Nothing is absolute but bigger is better in many cases ! For regular cars , go with the 2 " as the larger 3 " mirror will take up too much real estate .
5 #### The one other reviewer was right on when they said this unit is much smaller than the photos make it look . I was a little worried this was a bit large for my desk area . It ISN'T large at all , see the pix I posted . Unit works great and I am pleased . Some small nitpicky things are : The power brick is kinda big , the LED is really bright , and you do not use the normal A -- B USB cord to connect the hub to the PC ... you use an A -- MiniUSB cord . Not a big deal , but I have lots of 8 ft AB cords but no long A -- Mini . The 5 ' cord that comes with it is too short for me . Thanks for reading .
5 #### I was replacing a broken Magellan GPS unit , after no luck in getting repairs through their support center in India . This basic unit cost 1/2 of what the other did 2 years ago and is much easier to use . The touch screen has bigger letters and the volume ( which is adjustable ) is louder , so you can hear it over the road noise . I mainly use it to find garage sales and so far it has not failed me .
4 #### Super cute ! Not super sensitive though . Does n't seem to pick up on phone , but does pick up near other types of devices . I read this may be a frequency issue between the US vs UK phone frequencies . Could be . It eventually quit working after several months . Maybe it has a battery inside that died ? Not sure . Even without working though , it 's cute just to have a mini tardis . Husband loved it .
5 #### I bought it for a Blackberry 8520 ( Gemini ) and it has been working perfectly for three months now . 5 stars ! UPDATE 10/17/2011 After 5 months still working like new
4 #### This is a nice little pocket portable AM / FM radio , similar to the transistor radios of my Boomer youth , but now that integrated circuitry and microchips have replaced transistors , it is much lighter . There are many other ways these days to get one 's music or news , but if you find a need for this radio , best to go for it soon , as it has already been discontinued by Panasonic . I paid only $ 9.95 for mine a few years ago .
1 #### I purchased this item to dry my car . I own a black car and do n't recommend this product . Instead use a soft microfiber waffle towel . This product leaves streaks and swirl marks on the paint finish its to rough .
5 #### We love these little Zenergy chimes ! The sound is pure and loud , and the presentation with the wooden base , aluminum rods and little mallot is quite beautiful . Buy one , you wo n't regret it at all . We bought our first set of these , the Zenergy5 with five chimes , as a bit of a lark . They rapidly became a favorite , which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time . The chimes sat on an end table , and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them . We lost the five - note chimes after we had a party and our house , and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them . At the end , we gave the chimes to him , which delighted him , and of course delighted us as well . The next day , we purchased the Zenergy3 three - rod version of the chimes , simply to have something different . We are equally happy with the three - tone chime . Hint : Be sure to shop around ! Vendors offer these chimes here on Amazon at a variety of price points , including shipping .
3 #### This switch does work , but you should look before you leap . The switch travel is greater than it is for a standard 3 - way switch , and if you use the common Fender replacement control plate ( or one that was only intended for a 3 - way switch , it may not fit . You could fairly easily alter the plate , but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate .
5 #### Very strong . Using it on my raptor with a light bar
2 #### I never stayed on the windshield , if I hit a bump driving it would fell off the windshield . Only time is work right is when I was not moving .
5 #### Bought two of these , one for me and one for a buddy who needed to clear out some zerks . If you have any grease zerks on any of your equipment , then you need one of these . Notice I did n't say " might need " but rather " you need " one . Easy to use , and it blasts the hard contaminated grease from the zerk as well as the greased joint . Add new grease , and you 're up and running .
2 #### I had no problem with the phone some things could be design better But after only 6 months , the touch screen , no longer responded to touch You could still see screen , but had to use , buttons to navigate . called palm ( over the phone techs ( idiots ) ) I was told to mail , and it would be 5 to 7 business days to repair . It now has been 12 business days and still not repaired . They keep telling me , that they will put me on the hot list for repair . Now they tell me they do n't have the parts , and are waiting on them . To me , it seems that i am getting the run around . The phone is fine , as long as it does nt need a repair . I paid 479.00 for a piece of # # # #
4 #### Easily my favorite headphones at this price range . While the styling is dated it also has a unique look to it that you learn to either love or hate . Beyond the looks which frankly may turn some off these are some fantastic quality headphones . The sound quality is far above what you expect . I consider myself somewhat of a snob when it comes to headphones . Lastly if you wear glasses these are the most comfortable headphones I 've ever owned for wearing with glasses .
3 #### Not horrible . The incoming audio is almost painfully loud , but amazingly clear . The problem is the microphones are even more sensitive . This makes the person you 're talking to subject to every noise around you .
5 #### A friend of mine gifted me a cheap 12 string . I replaced the strings with these and was very impressed with the tonal quality . Very light strings , but still full bodied .
5 #### Not a name brand item , but hey ! It 's a pop filter , it is n't supposed to be fancy . Build quality is very good , product is inexpensive and it works well for my podcast recordings .
3 #### this will fit sizes up to 3.72"x 4.93 " ( 9.47 cm x 12.52 cm ) did n't see size on it when i ordered , just seen universal .. check the size you need before ordering ...
4 #### Overall a very nice product . Was n't sure I could trust the velcro closure to hold my iphone securely but it has n't been a problem . Ear bud cord wrap works great , just turn rubber cover inside out , wrap cord and flip the cover back down . Quick closure armband is easy to open and close one handed . Would be nice if armband did n't move out of adjustment when it was open but it 's easy enough to re - adjust before each use .
4 #### This radio has many options that I like such as going from portable to hand held . My on complaint is that as a hand held , the range of transmit is very short . So if you plan to use it to move from the Jeep to the car or ATV , then it is a great package .
5 #### this has been a must have in the detailing word . This holds SO much water and comes with a nice container to stow it away . Quality and works excellent , does not scratch . NEVER use another brand !
4 #### The legend will fit in the case and it looks nice . Would have given 5 stars if it was fully enclosed , because there is a little fear that the case will open and the headset will fall out in our line of work . However it is nice to have some place to store the little piece when it is not in use . The belt clip and case seem very sturdy .
5 #### A very decent meter for someone who does not want to spend alot of money a great beginner meter , but does not have auto ranging . The quality is above regular and is built very well . For $ 20.00 BUCKS YOU CANT GO WRONG.A very basic meter for basic needs .
5 #### This is a pretty good value at four bucks ; slightly cheaper than the hardware store and far more convenient if you can wait a few days . Shipping was quick . This is a pretty versatile size - you can always connect two together to make a longer one , as I did recently to rig some pulleys to my ladder to create an overengineered turkey frying apparatus . They 're rated to 75lbs , which makes them plenty strong for strapping furniture to the wall ( just need some brackets or eye screws mounted into a stud ) , and it 's far cheaper than the baby proofing products intended to do the same thing . One tip : they can be tough to fasten in tight spaces ( like behind a cabinet ) , but using a pair of needle nose pliers in each hand makes it easy to feed one end into the other and tighten it right down .
1 #### These wo n't hold a " touch " on my screen . When I try to drag a scroll bar it just wo n't keep hold of the bar . It may be my tablet but I do n't think so . I have a Toshiba Thrive which works great with finger touch .
5 #### This chip works great in my Galaxy S4 active . Put it in and load it up . Lots of room . I 've got all my Sinatra albums in there and loads of space left over .
4 #### This is high quality cable . It is as good as the one that came with the iPhone . I think that the cable is short in length but still well worth it .
5 #### I have used this kit on two Honda CRV 's . Both times it was a easy installation and a quality product .
4 #### I use both a Wet and Dry VHS head cleaner so this product goes well with the Maxell Wet Head Cleaner .
5 #### These work nicely for me . Plenty of tone , last beyond expectations . Shipped on time with no surprises .
5 #### These guitar picks work very well . They have the right amount of flexibility for playing and are the perfect length .
4 #### This container works well & enables you to flip the lid up on the trash in it until you can empty it . The so - called " grip strips " on the bottom are the " hook " strip of hook & loop material ; designed to attach to your carpet . Useless if you have a rubber floor liner like I do . They could have added a rubberized non - skid shelf liner type material between the hook strips that would keep the container in place on top the driveshaft hump . I 'll have to add it ( more $ ) with spray adhesive . Other than that , works well . One piece plastic liner that 's leak - proof . No seams .
5 #### this is great when your out and ca n't plug up your ipod and once you charge it up it stays charge until you use it on your ipod are iphone great buy and it does just what it 's should buy it you ca n't go wrong
4 #### I 've only had this phone for a day , but I find a couple of features missing that I 've found in lesser phones that are IN ADDITION to the very much repeated lack of speed dialing ( yes , there are no speed dial buttons ) or voice dialing , which are : No audible missed call alert . I 'm talking about the nagging beep that you can get with most phones ( except smart phones I think -- my AT&T 8525 does n't have it either ) . This phone does not give you an audible missed call alert . I 've been through the menus and searched online and nope , no mention anywhere . Can not seem to set up a BI - WEEKLY reminder . I 've tried it through the calendar and the alarm and even memo but no , no option for bi - weekly . There 's no direct way to do it . The addressbook is not truly searchable . What the heck ? ? You can drag a an alphabet slider down the left side that will take you right to the letter you want , but that 's it . Or , you can start dialing a number and it will find the rest of it in your phonebook , but that 's not ideal . Otherwise , love the phone . Great camera , great video , it moves fast through the screens . Pretty good reception so far ( only had it 1 day so I 'll update this review later down the road ) . Nice feel to the phone itself , and it paired nicely with the bluetooth of my Garmin Nuvi 660 . Texting is a pleasure as well .
5 #### This charger works great . It is compatible with the LG phones , one other charger I tried would n't charge the phone & an error message would come up . Shipping was super fast . I ordered 2 , one that stays in my suitcase for traveling and one for my office .
5 #### Excellent product . Heats up fast . Keeps us very comfortable on our long winter rides in our UTV .
4 #### I bought this router to split the connection in my room so I could connect to my XBOX and my computer at once , and its working perfectly so far .
5 #### When you first put these on they sound brassy . But wait ! Once the newness goes away they are very sweet strings . They sound great in my dread and my archtop .
5 #### I have an older car that does n't have the sync system to use with your cell phone . This Blue tooth is pretty comfortable and is easy to use . I 've trashed a few of these things in my time but this one has held up nicely . I recommend highly .
4 #### I think these binoculars are good value for money . If you want really superior optics , buy Leica and pay 20 or 30 times the price of the Bushnell . I have two pairs of these and they are just fine for knocking around in the truck and keeping in the hangar . Bushnell quality seems to be consistent , from the limited number of items I 've seen ( I also have a couple of pairs of their larger size binoculars which give better performance at the cost of higher price and bulkier size ) . The 10X32 model is fine for what it claims to be .
5 #### Awesome product , use it with my iPhone 4 all the time for running . Love it . Wish it would take my iPhone bumper so i do n't have to take it off everytime i use this but oh well .. great item for runners
5 #### Nice and smooth attenuation . I use it to adjust my earphones in bed while watching tv ( wife is a cranky sleeper and the slightest sound sends her into a tizzy ) . So this piece may have singlehandedly save a marriage !
4 #### the case is very nice . The think the black does nt go very well with the gray on the voyager and is bulky . But the case fit great and the item arrive in time . But is a nice case for the price .
1 #### Did not work at all . Seems like they may be tryinig to offload non working electronics on people and hope most do n't bother to request a refund . Took an inordinately long amount of time to receive the product as well .
5 #### The case that came with mine was made out of denim and a plug was not included . tested the impedance with a multimeter and it is indeed ~60 ohms . when i 'm not wearing them the metal band folds unevenly , that tells me that one ear is being pressed down on harder than the other and i feel it after they have been on my head for a while . is there a way to fix this ? i do n't know but the comfort zone levels ameliorate the situation however that is not enough and this does not go unoticed . i find myself having to re - adjust / position them inorder to relief some discomfort . everything else is awesome . do wish the cable was removable though :P
3 #### Good phone it worked well eve tho it had some scratches but the most important thing is that it worked
4 #### These should have been included with the feet , not as an extra . the whole package was rather spendy . Other wise vewry pleased with the thule brand .
4 #### This device does sync up with android phones . I am able to use all of the phone buttons without any issues . Every once in awhile I do have to unplug the device and setup the bluetooth paring again . The volume does not play as loud as CD but I think that is more of an issue with the radio and not the dockboss . I am very happy with this purchase .
2 #### I just got this phone and it 's really slick but there is one very significant design flaw in the Treo 600 that will cost you a ton of money -- BEWARE . It seems if you are on a call and your call - waiting goes off , there is no way to hang up on the first call and switch to the second . You can ONLY HANG UP ON BOTH CALLS ! So what happens is if you tell one person you 'll get back with them and then flip over to the other call BOTH CALLS CONTINUE TO RACK UP AIR TIME , regardless of whether the other person has hung up ! This is a huge design flaw , or maybe it 's intentional so you wipe out all your minutes . Whatever the case , I ca n't figure out how to deal with it except if you have call waiting , you should n't answer it , or you should answer both , hang up on both , then call who you want to talk to . This is RIDICULOUS ! ! BEWARE .
5 #### Thanks guys , exactly what I expected it to be . A good quality in - line fuse . I used this for the new fog lights I put into my car and it works great . Shipping was on time . Yes , it does n't come with a fuse , but I had one already so it was n't a big deal anyways . Thanks !
4 #### I first used SIT strings when they came on a new Michigan - made custom Reverend Slingshot in about 2002 . I emailed Reverend to see what strings they used and ended up ordering a dozen sets from SIT or one of their online sellers . I like that they were made in the USA and very affordable . They seem to last a long time with normal use and cleaning and do stay in tune very well ( as compared to whatever brands are on sale ) . This is also true of their acoustic offerings . I use electric guitars with several different kinds of vibrato system , from strat - style to Bigsbys , and as long as the vibrato itself is in good working order I have no problem with the SITs . I 'm sure there are better sounding strings out there , but once broken in and a little dirty these are just fine . I have n't been embarrassed by a string break in a live situation for quite awhile , although I take strides with all my guitars to make sure there are n't problems that will exacerbate breakage . Definitely a good deal for the always - broke musicians like me , I always buy a handful at at time and appreciate the bang for the buck .
5 #### It 's a cable . It 's OEM . You plug it in and it works . Done .
5 #### So I purchased this to change the struts on my 84 Volvo 245 and it worked ! The insert fit well and was turnable with an adjustable wrench and a 10 mm smaller wrench to hold the center piece in place . Three wacks with a hammer and it began to move ! Saved me a ton of money vs paying someone else . Also it has so far been very durable as there were no marks left on the tool after I was finished . This tool gets an A+ !
5 #### As a semi - audiophile , I ca n't listen to music with anything but these . Do get them !
4 #### have to rub pretty good for it to really work , I 'm female and can hardly reach the top front of the 5th wheel ( even with a ladder ) I ended up buying the 303 product as well , it was easier to use than this compound ( for me anyway )
3 #### For a little over 6 bucks , i have to know that it is NOT gon na be great but expect average quality . It says 1900 mAh , which means it should charge up to 80 % of iPhone 4 . I got about 60 % at most after 2 weeks of use . Having said that , i think 6 bucks is reasonable and 60 % is good .
4 #### I needed a replacement for my broken Plantronics BT headset but did not want to spend too much . As a coffee addict the name caught my eye and since the price was good and the specs seemed OK I ordered it . No regrets . The design is nice and the unit works well . Pairing with my phone is quick and reliable and both incoming and outgoing sound quality is good . Fit takes some work as it does not have the in - ear rubber plugs like the Plantronics . But the unit is quite flexible and adjustable so I was able to find a good position quickly . The ear loop is small enough that it does not interfere with my glasses . The buttons are big enough to operate even with gloves on although the volume buttons are in a slightly awkward position for that . Due to the relatively open design it does not do so well in windy conditions . I use this mostly when riding on my bike and I definitely have to slow down to understand incoming calls and to be heard by the other party . A minor inconvenience for me because I do n't usually make long calls while riding . Overall this is a very nice headset and definitely a bargain .
4 #### The vendor shipped fast and the product is as described . I bought it use and it is in operational condition . The deliverable current for the POE is not very high but does operate 4 cameras . I gave it a four start for that reason since it is a 16 port switch and only powers four camera before the current drop below operational level
5 #### WOW ! great piece , very surprised , incredible sound for a very good price , if you compare with the custom versions this is pretty cool for the price you are paying !
4 #### This packer is made in the USA , it is not a superior quality item though . The threaded portion is made from all thread and the threads are a little rough . It is n't probably an item that will last for generations , but it will last as a personal use item .
5 #### Great microphone ! Does it 's job as a dynamic mic . It can be used for many different instrument applications for live or recording , It 's a must have for producers , performers and sound engineers or just anyone who needs a reliable microphone .
2 #### I learned this the hard way so decided to share my experience in the hopes it 'll stop someone else making the same mistake . I 've used several ( milder ) clay bars in the past from brands such as sonus , mother 's , meguiars , zaino , Griot 's , and a couple of others . I 've found them to vary both in terms of ease of use and speed at which they removed the contaminants . My assumption with this clay was that being ' Aggressive ' , it 'd remove the bonded contaminants with less elbow - grease than milder claybars . Instead , what I found ( and later confirmed by reading online ) is that this clay is intended for heavy contamination , and as a precursor to swirl removal . I was careful to use this clay as directed , and with plenty of spray to keep the surface lubricated . It did a good job of removing contamination , but not noticeably better than other brands I 've used . The major downside I found with this clay was that it marred the paint horribly , leaving swirl marks all over the finish which was previously lightly swirled . If you plan to machine polish the car afterwards anyway , or do n't care about swirl marks this is probably a good enough product . For a light to normal amount of surface contamination , I 'd strongly recommend you look at something milder .
5 #### I am very glad for buying it . It is heavy duty and good quality for the price . It was very easy to install .
1 #### This might be the top selling CB radio - but I do n't recommend it and I definitely do not recommend Midland 's customer service / warranty . I bought it and barely used it ( it sat in my 4x4 , which I hardly drove ) . After several months of non - use , I switched it on and the CB radio would n't receive or transmit ( the weather band still worked ) . I called Midland and explained the problem to them . The customer service agent told me to ship it back to them . I shipped it back and a week later I got a phone call asking for a return authorization code because the 1 - year warranty had expired . I sighed and explained the situation but it was no use - Midland would n't touch it knowing the warranty was still valid ... or I could pay $ 75 an hour for an engineer to look at it . Yeaaaah , right . So , I bought it - used it 3 or 4 times - it breaks . Paid to ship it to Midland and now they are shipping it back , so I can throw it in the trash . Awesome , right ? No more Midland products for me .
1 #### I would not trust these at all for over 200 lb
5 #### Works great with my radio(Sangean ATS-909 / Radio Shack DX-398 ) . Should have bought it a long time ago .
4 #### I use this to mount the head unit of my Midland 75 - 822 CB to my dash . Works great .
5 #### very very good value for this reader , and I am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away . They immediately sent a replacement . Immediately .
5 #### I 'm transcribing interviews and this machine is excellent . With the foot pedal back - track , I can listen to the speaker as often as I need to without lifting my hands off my keyboard .
5 #### Needed a cable to connect an HP printer to my laptop . Ran to Target and they wanted $ 19 ! Moments later and a few clicks away Amazon sent this cable to my door for $ 4 total . Thank you very much !
5 #### For heavy gauge strings , these are the best for me . Great tone , long lasting , extremely rare for me to break ( only from over - bending when the strings were already blown out ) .
1 #### Cord did not work as a VGA cord - I was unable to connect correctly to my system with this cord
3 #### I am glad I did n't buy this when it was over $ 100 , I would have been pissed buying this used was a good way to experience it . I use it some but not often
5 #### Got it for my 9 year old daughter after I upgraded my iPhone and gave her my old 4S , she loves it , and she has dropped her phone like a hundred times , and nothing ! no damage ! Great case !
5 #### This wall mount successfully held my 32 - inch LCD TV for over 3 years in my home , with no issues whatsoever . For a price far cheaper than what I could find in the store at the time , I could n't recommend this product enough ! I have n't tried anything heavier than my 32 - inch , which weighed about 20 pounds , but it was perfectly sturdy at that weight . The joints all moved freely without being too loose , and I never had an issue positioning the TV just how I wanted it . A great buy !
4 #### working well so far . used it on my trailer , no complaints . I used lucas trailer grease and it was very watery , maybe I should try some of that red grease .
4 #### Does n't swivel , so if your piping curve is even a bit off center then so is this shower head . I wrote to the seller asking how to fix , no reply . That said , the water flow is good .
5 #### I was a bit apprehensive to purchase a slide online without knowing how it fits . But the price on this one made the risk worth it and turns out that it fits my ring finger perfectly and my fingers are rather stubby .
5 #### these are great , always have been and a must have in the shop .
5 #### When I needed a gas pump , I first ordered a Chinese clone . It did n't have the strength ( and ability ) to lift the fuel 3 feet out of the tank . I should have ordered the Fill - Rite pump to start with . It works perfectly . It is strong , reliable and really made well . I learned my lesson : If you want something to be made well , and be reliable , purchase it from a U.S. company - who will also support the product if you do have any difficulties . This pump is perfect . Now , I can pump fuel reliably !
5 #### Based on the price for only $ 20 , I gave a 5 stars .
5 #### This works as described and I have not encountered any problems . The seller shipped it quickly and I am pleased with the purchase .
5 #### I like mine . They sound nice and you ca n't complain about the price .
2 #### I bought three of these . My college kids said they were the best so to protect our Droids I ordered one for each of us . We opened them on Christmas . Very impressed with the fit and styling . Love the way all the openings are protected . Wow ! A screen saver included . Whoo Hoo ! All three front pieces have broken at a corner . So we have all resorted to using our old cover fronts with the Otterbox backs . I hate products that fail .
2 #### I purchased this item to dampen my 22 in bass drum but although well made , it is of such a light construction that it has little to no chance of working correctly . It will most likely work on a smaller type drum like a traveler kit ( 16 in bass ) but not a full size kit .
4 #### This is a guy 's dream mat for either gun cleaning or the more innocent guy 's stuff at day 's end when a working man empties his stuff on that table or desk or bureau or dresser . Now just dump all your keys , phones , wallets , knives , glasses etc on this welcoming mat . I use it for pistol cleaning every month-- dual use in the Duffy House . I drive and love a 2010 Jeep Commander , so that is why I rocked this impulse buy last pay day .
5 #### Great quality at a great price - I make these available to my students at cost so they do n't have to share the school recorders ( yes i sanitize them daily ) . They love all four colors - pink , green , blue , and ivory - and often trade with their friends to make multi - colored recorders to suit their individuality and creativity .
1 #### Despite what the other reviewer stated , I have serious doubts about the construction of this mute . It 's basically cardboard with a wood base . I do n't know how DW can call this " fiber " . In 2013 , when one talks about fiber , one is talking about woven materials that are strong , durable , man - made materials . While this is clearly man - made , it 's neither strong nor durable , in fact it came with a soft spot in it already , likely where someone pressed on it too hard with a finger or thumb . Dennis Wick makes a far better mute , the DW5531 , that doubles as both a cup and straight mute . While it 's more expensive , it 's far better made and offers both standard mutes that every trumpet player should have . If you ca n't afford the DW5531 , but the old standard Harmon J1 Triple Play Combo Trumpet Mute .
5 #### It took me over 6 years to go through my first cartridge , and the last label I created was just as perfect as the first one I made 6 years ago
5 #### Dropped these into a MIM Strat . No hum and retained the classic strat quack and clarity . They 're sensitive to height adjustments , so tweak 'em to taste . I tried the Dimarzio Area pu 's and lost some of the signiture Fender quack and clarity . I prefer these . If you want the Fender sound , then buy Fender pu 's . Lesson learned .
5 #### Not all pairs are the same weight . Obviously the sticks in the pair match , but each pair is not consistent , some are very heavy and some are way too light . I ordered 5 pairs and only 2 were the perfect weight
5 #### This lug key is the best . I can get so close with this , that ear tuning takes only seconds afterward . Agreat tool for the price . You just have to be careful when using it to loosen the lug . The shoulders are plastic , and when I was loosening the head to try a different muffling system ( not using the tool for it 's stated purpose ) I snapped the downside shoulder off . The key still works great for tuning , I just hate the reminder that I 'm ' not so smart ' .
4 #### Good quality headphones I purchased for my kids ages 5 and 10 to use with their tablets . They are comfortable and provide good sound . They have used them for a few months without problems .
5 #### these chargers are going by the wayside and hard to find - the " custom chargers " that let you select different modes are just fine unless you lose house power ... then you have to reset them - this charger does a great job and will come back on line after a power loss - a great way to keep a stored vehicle charged without having to check it constantly
5 #### Pretty straight forward . Does what it 's supposed to do . Would n't use as high quality singing vocal mic . I use as a backup corded option to my wireless mics for wedding DJ gigs .
5 #### Possibly the best constructed audio cables available . For use in my car for cell phone and MP3 player to play over car audio speakers . Although I have them only a few weeks , they perform flawlessly but over time , their apparent superior construction and design will be tested .
5 #### I like 'em . I buy Mediums and use them tuned down a whole step on my Breedlove AW .
5 #### I was worried at first making the the purchase because this bluetooth has nothing to hold onto like around the ear but it fits into the ear perfectly and there 's different size pieces so you do n't have to be concerned about it not fitting . Its so small and perfect . Shipping was really fast too . Thanks
4 #### Nice telephoto lens for the price . Functional and takes great pics . More expensive lenses may have more functions , but this is a great starter lens .
5 #### These sounded really good . I used them on my Epiphone EJ-200 . I recorded with them and I was really impressed . Held tuning very well and had a good warm sound . At this point I use Ernie Ball on all my guitar because the just work and always sound great .
5 #### As far as hangers go , this one really is worth getting . It is sturdy , easy to assemble and mount and it provides security without damaging the neck . Ideal product .
5 #### I am VERY satisfied with my hard shell A - style mandolin case ; I received prompt delivery , it was reasonably priced , and a quality product ; thanks !
5 #### I needed a non - bulky reference guide to carry with me . This takes the mystery out of the D300 and has given me a broader perspective on the capabilities of this camera .
4 #### This cable works great . The only suggestion I have is to probably go a little longer ( 10 feet + )
5 #### THIS CABLE WORKS GREAT AND HAVENT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT SO FAR BUT YET THE ONE IN THE PICTURE ISNT THE SAME ONE I RECIEVED BUT THE ONE I DID RECIEVE LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER BUT IT DOESNT CHARGE MY PHONE AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE IT CONNECTED BUT NO BIGGY RIGHT HERE STILL THINK ITS DESERVES 5 STARS !
5 #### Very useful to keep your guitar picks within easy reach . Sure beats trying to pick them up off a flat surface or out of your pocket . Easy installation .
5 #### Outstanding . I use one at home and work and have for years . The thumb movement may feel odd at first if you 're used to another style , but it quickly becomes a preferable method .
5 #### Well , to be honest I had a little trouble figuring it out . Because my Hi Hat has hardware that did n't quite match up.(the threads and so forth ) So , with a little ingenuity , patience , admittedly a little bit of swearing at times , when the patience ran thin . I figured it out . And it works fantastic . I started out on the drum set at 9 years old , & I played till I was about 17 . I have n't played since then until about year ago . ( That 's been approximately 39 years . ) I got back into it , and obviously as far as technology is concerned I 've been out of the loop . This is a great thing to have for any drummer . so far , it 's been a lot of fun to use . And for the time being , I would recommend it to anyone .
5 #### This review is on the GS205 5 - Ports Gigabit Switch . It 's a good basic switch . Works right out of the box . The power cords adapter is large and takes up multiple spaces on a power strip . One solution for this problem , which is not limited to this item are the power strip extenders available from Cyberguys . The GS205 would have been of more use to me a few years ago . I had more computers and none had WiFi . If you still have a wired network you can ' not go wrong with this .
4 #### I have used Maxwell for some time . I liked the price and having used these in the past , you can retape over them many , many times . I use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime . You get good , clear pictures even after several months of taping . I would reorder these again . Also , there are few , if any , places locally to purchase any brand of VHS tapes .
5 #### Microsoft warns left handers against using this mouse . Well , I 'm left handed , and I love it . I find it very precise for working with bitmap images and correcting tiny defects like dirt spots on my scanned negatives . But do n't sue me if you 're left handed , use it , and wind up with a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome or whatever it is that people get when they work with unergonometric computer equipment .
5 #### Excellent price and quality!!!($7.44 shipped ) I was not expecting such a quality made product for what I paid ! Ordering 2 - 3 more today . They would make great floor mats . flat tire knee pads , tool box mats , small welcome mats , bathroom mats etc . Get a couple , you 'll be glad you did !
2 #### If you are running a low - fi sound system and have no plans to perform , then this is your answer . However , if you have invested in a good , quality sound system and perform either live or in the studio this will be the weak link in your system . As with most things in life , you get what you pay for and I was sadly mistaken when I thought a $ 14 switch would perform inline with my band 's sound system . When hooked up to an expensive Shure headset mic for our drummer run straight into the board this switch caused the mic to cut out and feed back . Once we removed the switch ( the weakest link ) , we had no issues . If you need something reliable for a peformance I would recommend something like the Proco Power Mute . Sure it 's more expensive , but it 's built like a tank , the performer can stomp on the footswitch and the light turns green ( mic on ) or red ( mic off ) , and it 's transparent as far as effecting your sound . Also no worries about extending the mic or cable run with this long switch .
5 #### this product is great . I ca nt see any fingerprints and it is VERY cheap ! most places charged 14.95 ! for one ! this is three for only a dollar ! plus the cleaning cloth ! great product and I look forward to ordering with this company in the future
4 #### I soooo wanted to keep these . Everyone raves about them . In the end I felt the beyer t90 did the job better . For just music , these are what you want .
3 #### Product worked well for my needs . The price I paid was very good compared to a retail store . Shipping was on time . Packaged very well . Good by for the money .
4 #### I got this product fast in about 3 days it came just like the description says . Even if I drop the phone the case still works . For the price is definitely worth it .
4 #### good sound just a little dim on the bottom E
5 #### It arrive promptly . Nice combination . LED 's are very bright . Have used it for a couple weeks and I am happy with it .
5 #### I get everything on Amazon now . Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping . Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment . He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course . Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings , I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time . Stretch them bend them and they do n't break . If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently . Thanks much .
5 #### I heard about these from a friend , several years back . I teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship services . These strings allow me to keep on keepin ' on for several weeks at a time , even with constant usage . I wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions . [ ... ]
5 #### It works well with the printer , no problem at all like some other usb cable i brought for my other printer .
5 #### Great product ! Locks down the hitch very tightly . No movement , no banging around while hitched up too a trailer .
4 #### just using it for home application , finish a bit rough but works fine , looks like it could take some punishment
4 #### Its great to have such a sustainable battery life . days go by and no charge is required . All fits well .
5 #### We got this phone for our 12 year old middle schooler and she absolutely loves it . She fell in love with it at first sight , loves the white and green color combo . She says texting is so quick now with the keyboard and she loves all the applications and extras . In fact I 'm a bit jealous of all it 's features compared to my Balckberry Pearl . For your money it 's packed and good buy compared to more spendy phones like the iphone and the Pantech Duo she was also looking at . My only complaint is the lack of accesories such as cases right now ..... but it 's new and I 'm sure we will start seeing them .
5 #### Just happen to have an old labeler machine that needs this tape . It 's hard to find now , and the price elsewhere is much higher . So , five stars for being available on Amazon , for working great , and for selling at a great price .
2 #### It was great , but now it does n't retain juice . do n't waste your money , get the anker astro 10000 mAh instead .
4 #### This is nice and durable , but too pricey for what it is . Wish I could 've made my own ; it would have been cheaper
5 #### The nokia N8 is a great phone , the best part about it is that you do't need to carry around a camera with you everywhere you go , everything you need for photos is within one place . thanks PUT group , you 've made my day . For a guaranteed phone PUT group is the best place to buy it . Nice doing business with u
5 #### I love the way these strings sound and they last forever . No . They really do . My acoustic has had the same strings for 2 years . 2 years ! ! That 's absurd . They still sound good , too . In fact , they sound better than they did new because they have lost that tinny " new - string " sound . Now they sound like normal phosphor bronze strings that have been on a guitar for 3 weeks . I was traveling in Europe with one of my guitars that had a 2 - month old set of strings . Somebody plucked a few notes and looked up to exclaim , " new strings " ! I kind of laughed to myself . These strings have completely changed what I consider to be a " new " set . Granted , they are not cheap , so if you break strings a lot it can get expensive . Clearly , I do not break strings a lot , so for me they are awesome .
5 #### After 30,000 miles on my Kn filter i felt like it was time to wash and clean for better performance . I see now why this kit is so important . it first washes away all the old dirt and oil . Then the spray oil relubes it back to new condition . The kit comes with easy instructions and arrives within 6 days . Solid easy buy ! !
5 #### Over the top distortion / overdrive , this pedal squeals when you bend it and it gives a great warm germanium crunch for rhythm and riffs . I really love it as an overdrive or distortion for riffs . Wish MXR would add tone or bass / treble though . I burnt one out , I immediately ordered another one , the tone is just that good !
4 #### This blue tooth is great but th ear hook breaks easily so be aware and order a couple of pairs of the ear hooks to have on hand .
5 #### Pros : + Affordable + $ 10 for 4 rolls + ISO 400 is good for everyday use + C-41 processing is everywhere and cheap Cons : - None Although it 's getting tougher and tougher to find places that will develop film , shooting film is still enjoyable . I bought my first film camera , a Nikon FE2 , in 2013 . I 've used and had other film cameras before , but the Nikon FE2 was my first purchase for myself . Anyways , this film pack is affordable and gives good results . After having shot over 192 pictures with this ( 24 exposures per roll , at least 8 rolls ) , I really enjoy this film . The colors are very natural and pleasing . At a cost of less than three dollars per roll , this film makes it easy and cheap for anyone looking to explore film photography on a budget . Keep in mind these rolls are 24 exposures each . I shoot with an FE2 50 mm 1.8 or 85 mm 1.8 . Both have great results when used with this film .
5 #### Love it .... well until i got the wireless keyboard now i do n't really use this product anymore . Now i am not sure why i saw the hype in it to begin with my its good for using with touch phones when you have on gloves ...
5 #### The ability to add handsets is one of the best features of the 2420 system . Setting up new handsets is nearly effortless : just enter the numbers on the bottom of the base unit to register , and it 's working . You immediately get the ability to page between handsets , not to mention all the other great features of the 2420 .
4 #### The folding option is wonderful . It 's very compact but holds the guitar nicely . Just be certain you have the guitar secured in place . It 's never fallen but it may . Looks great too .
1 #### This headset does not cancel outside sound . It also is n't very loud and broke broke a couple days after I got it . Very cheaply made !
3 #### I had a Dean Markley sound hole pickup , which produced a hum when I turned up the volume . I thought this pickup ( Seymour Duncan Hum - Canceling pickup ) would be ideal for my needs . It does eliminate the hum , but the Dean Markley had better tone and volume at a lower setting . I use it regularly , but am actively looking for an upgrade .
4 #### It is a wonderful case if you tend to drop your phone on occasion . However , the belt clip is hard to remove from your belt due to the bottom portion of the clip ( it curls upward a little too much ) . This is the best case for protecting your Blackberry . It is even easy to use the keyboard with the protective cover over it .
5 #### The bag had a little more room than I anticipated . I was able to put in the Canon Camera , the regular lense , and the zoom lense in the main case .
5 #### So far I like it . I have only had it installed for a few days but it seems pretty good so far . We will see how it does in the summer .
4 #### Used this for a cross country trip . worked great ! I was able to keep my cell phone charged , and plug in both my GPS and XM radio .
1 #### leaks a lot . and leaks out after you use it no matter how tight the hose is
5 #### Using it on my Roland keyboard and it works great .
4 #### This harness is absolutely awesome , not only are the wires color - coded appropriately to most major car stereos , they also have the wire labeled so you do n't confuse yourself . The only drawback is that it does n't ' snap in ' the the existing harness ' tab for added security . Would receive 5/5 stars if it did .
5 #### ... for connecting effects boxes in series . Inexpensive and work as they should . Long enough to allow clearance between boxes , but , not too long where you have to enter another zip code to reach another switch .
5 #### Have you been considering good headphones ? Have you searched the net and Head - Fi looking for advice ? Look no further . If you want open headphones , choose the Sennheiser PX100 or Grado SR60 or SR80 . IF you want closed , there is no better choice under $ 150 than the MDR - V6 . Beware the other Sony models - they have a few good ones , but most are not so good , even a few that are pricier than this one . This is the same headphone ( except for cosmetics ) as the MDR-7506 -great sound -easy to drive with or without an amp -durable -comfortable Do not hesitate - you wo n't regret these ! Update 6/2010 : These are still great , but Shure has since introduced two models ( the SRH-440 and 840 ) that are very nice and worth a listen , some will certainly prefer them to the Sony . The 440 is very close in price as well . Also worth considering is the Denon AH - D1000 and D-1001 , which when on sale are around $ 100 . The Denons have great sound , perhaps slighlty more appealing to me than the Sony , but the Denon has absolutely the best comfort in any headphone that sounds decent and is under $ 500 . The Sony wins on ruggedness and value , though , and the sound is n't worlds apart ...
5 #### I love these strings on all guitars but especially on the ES-175 , ES-137 and both of my ES-335 's . Al thought they are a little heavier I do n't find the overly difficult to bend . That being said I would not use the on a Telecastor or Stratocaster !
5 #### Immediately I inserted this to my phone It was recognized immediately Easy to insert I 've been using this for like a week and half And I still have a lot of space left You may think 8 gig is a small amount of space But to be honest it is big enough Trust me I love taking pics and videos Downloading apps and playing games on my phone So I know a thing or two about using up a lot of space I would really suggest this to anyone looking for a capable efficient SD card
5 #### The battery is great and lasts a very long time . IMAX Power 's customer service is great as well . My battery stopped working and I called them and I sent mine back and they sent me a new one with no problems . I will order from them again . Works great for IPOD touch . It however does not work with Motorola Droid . I think it has to do with the electrical power . I think they are working on getting it to work with the Droid as we speak . Thanks for a great product . rktecct
5 #### It is great , I love it and the look it has ! The only downside is the lace may break away from the cover .
5 #### I was able to stick it on without any problems . I am using the Krusell case as well , so I have double protection . :-) But , it looks good when I take the phone out of the Krusell case too .
4 #### Excellent product fulfilled the expectations and function for which it was adquiridad thank you . we will be very helpful for future efficient purchases
4 #### I like the 14 inch ties . I had a lot of 8 inch ties , but I needed a larger size and these fit the bill . I tied up a lot of my electrical cords that are behind my entertainment center and now it is not such a roadway of wires all over the place .. I 'm sure the 14 inch ties will come in handy for some outside projects too .
4 #### Synopsis : I like this tool and it has served me well . I would recommend this tool to any one playing guitar , uke , banjo or mandolin . I have used it on all of these and it works very well . Price : just under $ 7 , and worth it because of multi functionality . What it is : String winder , and nipper ... this is used for changing strings on your guitar , banjo , uke , mandolin , etc ... Quality : The construction is solid , and tight . The nippers are sharp and leave a clean cut string end . What you get : string winder / nipper What I like : I like that this winder has a slot for smaller tuning machines like those found on ukes , and Mandolins . I also like that this has a string nipper to trim the string ends . I have used this for a couple years now , and the nippers still leave clean cuts ( I do string changes every 3 months for 4 instruments that I play regularly ) . I also like that this is small enough to fit into the compartment of my hardshell guitar cases . What I do n't like : the handle could have a better ergo - grip ... as I said , I change strings on multiple instruments every few months , and this winder will have your hand cramping if with heavy use ... for that reason I am considering picking up an electric string winder , but I will continue to use this one until that point
4 #### Be sure to take your time , do some measuring and some marking on the wall with a pencil . Use a level and take your time , cause once it 's on , it 's not going anywhere . Once it 's on , it looks great . 1 star off because you will need a saw or good knife to cut these . It 'd be nice if there was a better system for this , or at least grooves to assist the process .
5 #### Works great . I 've had these for over a year in my 2012 Mercedes C250 . The light emits as clear ( even though the bulbs are blue ) . Very good ( albeit not perfect ) match for my LED highlights . When they 're on , the lights look great together .
4 #### Buying strings online for the first time was an experience . I knew to look for acoustic strings but as far as what kind , I was oblivious . I ended up buying these and I have nearly no complaints except one . The sound is , by comparison to my stock strings , magnificent and I really feel like I can strum vigorously for hours without worrying about the D string snapping and slapping my face . But as I said before , I do have one complaint but that has more to do with my inexperience then with the strings themselves . When comparing this set of strings to the Light Nanoweb coating set , I perceived the amount of coating was what the Light and the Medium was referring to . No no . For all of you rookies out there , it 's referring to the thickness of the strings , my mistake . If I had to do it all over again , due to my weak hands , I 'd go with the Light NANOWEB coating set . Elixir strings sound great , feel great , and look great as well so if you 're considering this brand as an option , you should make it your only one .
1 #### I wo n't rehash the Nook vs. Kindle issue , but we 'll say I chose to buy the Nook because it just sounded better based on what people were saying . HOWEVER - I 'd say i made a huge mistake . I loved the way the Nook worked , but reliability becamea huge issue . My first Nook died within 24 hours . I figured it was just a bad egg , took it back , and they completely replaced it with a brand new one . My second one died 6 months later . I took it to two different stores and they were unable to fix it . Since it is still under warranty , They advised I call or email . Over the last 3 months , I 've sent several emails and get auto - responses saying they have a higher volume of messages than usual , please call . I 've also racked up tons of cell phone minutes trying to call and have yet to break through before my lunch break is over , or my toddler starts wanting my attention , etc ... I guess I 'll just chalk it up to a total waste of my money and start saving for a Kindle ! ! !
5 #### I wo n't lie i did n't love the beginning and it took me a while to go back because the beginning turned me off a few times but once i let the story fill me i could n't get enough i have read this one at least three times not skipping any part like they are all new love it .
5 #### works well , price is kinda high , but Amazon always delivers .
5 #### My 5th grader absolutely loves this , perfect size for young ones , easily adjusts , good padding , easy to use plastic attaching connector --- all great ! Highly recommended ! ! !
5 #### Heed all the reviewers who say to get a switch rather than a hub ! Especially with this one : it 's dirt cheap in price but not quality ! On this , each port has a dedicated 100 Mbps ( or 200 in full duplex ) of bandwidth . The only ' downside ' is that the 5th port and the Uplink are shared , so you can only use one or the other . Seems to be standard on the smaller - sized Linksys products though , not a big deal . ( This is even better if you can get it on sale but even on Amazon.com it is very reasonable ! ) . I have read that some top brands are better than other top brands . I have n't had much experience with using a wide variety of network equipment brands , but as far as Linksys goes I am completely satisfied . I have two BEFSR41 Cable / DSL Routers , several NIC 's ( network cards , LNE100TX , across several release versions ) , their dual intigrated 56 K modem / Fast Ethernet PC Card ( awesome , and no dongle ! ) , and now this switch from them , and I do n't have any complaints - they will continue to be my first choice .
5 #### really nice headset -- especially for the price -- i use it for my radio while i am walking -- no more ear buds for me
5 #### I believe that Medium Fender Pure Nickel Electric Guitar Strings are a perfect match with my vintage 1966 Fender Jazzmaster .
1 #### This does not fit a 2003 Ford Focus . Amazon 's filter to check if this fits your car is incorrect .
1 #### E ( 1 ) string broke before I could even get it half way tightened up to be in tune . No more Fender strings for me . I did n't buy these at Amazon , but at a local national guitar shop .
5 #### This is a must . My work bb battery would n't last a day . And there are times when I 'm not near an outlet to plug it in . This is great for emergency power times . And on long flights , I plug my son 's electronics in so he can watch movies and be quiet . A lifesaver !
5 #### I 've seen this guitar rated on several websites , citing it as a great quality instrument for an inexpensive price . I was my first time buying epiphone and I will totally recommend this to anyone ! It 's a really amazing sound for such a good price . I 'm shocked I have n't heard of this before . It 's a perfect starter guitar and I would say it will last well into your intermediate playing ! Very happy customer !
5 #### No complaints here ! Gets the job done and helps organize cables .
4 #### I use the external battery for when I ca n't charge my phone or iPad readily with a wall outlet . The led battery meter is not so reliable and it 's lost charge quickly twice but it is a solid buy . It 's charged my electronics when I needed them enough to get power back to them . Being a college student I rarely get to be in my dorm room to power up and this battery saves my day
5 #### I recently got my mom the Samsung Rugby II with AT&T. I got this charger set for her for Christmas and she is thrilled to have the extra chargers around . They are a great price , and she says they charge the phone just fine . Maybe they wo n't last as long as the OEM charger because of how cheap they are(who knows ) , but they are working just fine now . It will be especially nice to use the USB data cable to get some decent ringtones and backgrounds onto her phone . The Rugby II comes without much , so the data cable will be very helpful in sprucing it up . Very happy with the purchase .
5 #### Nice mouthpiece that did n't break my piggy bank . Have been using it for a year now and have had no issues .
5 #### This head give me the best overall snare drum sound that I can find . I have on purchased 2 more for my other snare drums ! 13 " & 14 "
3 #### It does the job , back lighting is not that great , came with a clear light , existing gage that I had red back lighting so I put the red cover from it on this gage so that all my gages have the same lighting , its very dim .
5 #### These guitar strings are very nice and I love them . I always buy this brand . They work well and sound amazing .
5 #### Great little battery for small projects . I 'm using it as a backup battery ... in that type of custom application it is difficult to find a suitable charger that can charge it properly and also handle a small load at the same time . I am now considering this charge controller to address this issue:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mini - Box - picoUPS-120 - battery - automotive - enviroments / dp / B005TWE4Q0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mini Box picoUPS 120 battery automotive enviroments</a >
5 #### Saved me from re - wiring my trailer . Had to use as my dual jetski / add on bike rack put the trailer away from the truck an extra 6 inches . Worked perfectly .
5 #### These picks are the most comfortable picks I have ever used . I own them in different thicknesses for different guitars / playing styles but will not play with any other pick .
4 #### Seems like a nice compromise in string gauge . They work well .
5 #### Holds my carrier rack tight , so now I do n't have to jam a shim into receiver and shaft to keep it tight so no more bouncing loads .
3 #### Good quality parts , mine arrived missing the " face plate " so it would n't work with a dual post stereo . I ended up using a standard single - din stereo which allowed me to reuse the stock Toyota mounting brackets .
5 #### Heavy duty plastic . Total length is 23.5 inches . The lock - head accounts for half an inch of that , and the first 7/8 inch of the tongue have no locking ridges . Total locking length of the tongue is 21 3/4 inches . Width of the tongue is 3/8 inch ; width of the head is 9/16 inch . Thickness of the tongue is 1/16 inch . Thickness of the head is 5/16 inch . Smallest locking loop diameter is about 1 1/2 inches . You can try for 1 1/4 but you might not get it all the way tight at that diameter . Largest locking loop diameter is somewhere around 6 1/2 inches . If you 've got something you need a long , thin strap to bundle or tie down , this might do the trick for you . Self locking ... so it you need to untie it later you 'll need to cut the zip tie off . Good for semi - permanent applications . Try to avoid tightening the strap around any sharp edges or right - angle square corners because it may rub and break at that point .
5 #### Outstanding lights , I installed these on an MG TD , they fit just fine and night driving is safer . I used Dorman 84790 sockets and I wired the ground to chassis rather than to the bucket . Could n't be happier with the result , great lights .
5 #### Perfect funnel to pour oil into your crankcase .. This funnel can be used for other purposes of course , .. but I bought it for pouring quart oil into my crankcase .
1 #### Started having problems after just a short while with the connection to my Mp3 player . Had to buy one from another vendor . Get what you pay for I guess
5 #### The only strap locks I use . Admittedly , I 've never tried any others personally . But have never had / wanted to .
5 #### I have n't put any other strings on my acoustics for well over a decade . I just love these strings .
5 #### Fit my 2014 F150 . You have to do a lot of stretching , but that makes it a nice tight fit .
4 #### Window wipes leave streaks . Other products are as good as I remember .
2 #### Was very excited to get this unit . Setup was a breeze , and was simply to use . Sound quality thru the car stereo was surprisingly good . Only drawback with FM transmitter was would n't tune below 88.1 , which most units I have used can - which is where all the unused US frequencies are ( in other word clear channels so you are n't constantly retuning the channel ) . Unfortunately 3 days into using it , the FM transmitter button would n't consistently turn the transmitter on or off - which is the reason I bought this unit over others . Returned for refund and am shopping for something else .
1 #### Purchased from Eforcity , US seller that I 've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the price . Not this case . Item is the proper fit , and fits bumper cases or special cases that would only accept an Apple headphone jack ( ie thin ) . But , at first , I was getting audio from just one channel - Jiggling a bit the cable at the base of the male end , 2nd channel started working but was getting static noise by just moving the cable . Audio would then come and go , by briefly moving the cable . Filed claim for damaged item . Seems to me a $ 1.70 down the drain .
3 #### These are fair quality headphones for the price . They are a little tight on the head . I get better quality out of the ear speakers but they keep falling out .
4 #### As a rank beginner , I do like the feel of these ( easier on my fingers ) vs uncoated and they sound good to me , but honestly my musical vocabulary is pretty much at baby talk level . My partner , who actually plays ( but does play electric much more than acoustic , which might influence his taste ) likes them and says they have a bright sound .
5 #### Great strings ! ! I stick to this brand . Great quality and great price !
5 #### I have a big head so the extenders are great they fit snuggly on my head compared to other head phones like theses the earpads are very soft Sony constructed theses to be long lasting headphones i see that when holding them they feel like they would get the job done when it comes to media needs most importantly the sound i ve had alot of sony headphones . you hear sound that you would nt even believe is in the music bass is not too beefy ( all though you can make them kick hooked up to a nice amp ) mids have so much life to it highs are on point you really get that TTT that you looking for in like cymbals or hi hats i simply love these headphones i guess it really is sony make believe but do n't trust my word alone you have to hear them to get that experience
5 #### Quick and easy . We were going to buy a new DVD player , but tried this first . It took a couple of runs through , but saved us the price of a new player
5 #### I 've tried several headsets and this is by far the best one yet for me . I really like the reduced size compared to the older version . One thing I did n't like about that one was the fact that it extended below my ear and just looked a bit busy . This one fits nicely and is extremely comfortable - So comfortable that I sometimes forget I have it on . Ok but that is cosmetics - what about function . In my opinion none is better as to sound quality and sound clarity . Buttons are intuitive and easy to operate . I 'm using with an Iphone 4 and it is a good companion and - It just works .
5 #### I ordered this 1394 cable to retrieve some videos I had stored in more than 25 DV tapes . My video cam is the Sony HandyCam DCR - HC21 , which is no longer compatible with WIndows 7 . I installed the software directly from Sony website that allows Win7 function with the handycam via a i - Link cable that Sony recommends . Their i - Link cable costs over 65 dollars . For a cable ! I decided to try this one here , and what do you know ... ! ! I have all my videos right now in DVDs ! It took 110 + DVDs to store all my videos , but hey ! they are safe and we can go back and share the memories on our flat screen ... priceless ! This cable rocks ! Do n't pay so much for a i - Link cable , this here does the trick . And another plus , this cable is very long ! Nice ! Will store it forever in case I need it again .
5 #### One year of service for the money is great . All I will buy is minutes for the whole year . I will do the same next year .
5 #### I have n't driven through water or extreme mud yet but I have it under my hood and directly to my battery to protect my off - road lights and this thing is doing the trick .
5 #### Love these picks ! Lighter , better than the cheaper ones I had at home - yet a great price . Will buy again .
5 #### Good deal from a good seller with fast shipping . These are similar but nicer than the ones that lasted me over 10 years parking my boat outside in the weather .
1 #### I ordered this product previously from this seller and I liked it . After about a year of use , it was starting to show wear . I ordered a replacement and it is not as listed . The item pictured is not what you receive . The cut outs for your charger , etc . are not in the places as shown in the picture ... the one shipped is not even the CELLET brand as it had been previously . Further , the seller offers a ' Hassle - Free Returns Policy ' as long as the item is defective . I suggest you look for the same item from another seller .
5 #### Works . Comes with the adapter and is seen by my nook hd+ , samsung galaxy player 5.0 , and my computer adapters ( I have a few ) . Ca n't go wrong if you need a small card :)
5 #### Perfect replacement for my old dirty filter . It is OEM and super easy to install .
5 #### you want to make a $ 300 guitar behave like a $ 1000 guitar ? get the intonation adjusted by someone who knows what they 're doing , then put a set of grover tuners on it . i have n't had to tune my guitar in nearly a week ! they are smooth and never slip .
4 #### This is actually a pretty slim charger for the capacity and might be better for small pocket than some of the other chargers . It is narrower , but slightly thicker and longer to balance out the internal capacity . It has very solid construction that is typical of other New Trent products I have experience with . The unit itself input charges from a micro USB connection which means you can use your phone charger to charge the charger ( unless you are an Apple user that is ! ) . It has 4 battery gauge LEDs that come on and stay on during charging which is really nice . The only output charging caveat , is that it powers off when connected to a low power device like my plantronics bluetooth headset . This can be worked around in the two - port New Trent chargers by plugging a high power device into the other port , but since this charger only has one port , that 's a no - go . Make sure this is OK for your application . The LED is not very bright , it 's on par with a keychain light . The laser pointer works fine , although activating / deactivating it can be a nuisance until you learn the button sequences required to operate all three functions : laser , light , and charger . If you are looking for a narrower charger with a laser pointer , maybe for your computer bag , this might be for you .
5 #### Used to complete circuit for black water tank discharge system . Majority of ones available were very thin gauge . This worked and compatible with gauge of wire on system .
5 #### The New Trent IMP 500 is a lifesaver if you own an HTC Evo . This charger delivers the extra power needed , since the Evo seems to suffer from " battery drain syndrome . " I far prefer it over a large internally - mounted extended battery , which limits cover and car docking choices . The New Trent is small , approximately 2 3/4 " X 3 3/4 " X 5/8 , " and includes both the adapter needed for the Evo , and for charging the New Trent without having to use the Evo power cord . ( I specified that I was using an Evo when I ordered the New Trent , and the proper adapter was included . ) Prior to this battery , I had ordered the IMP50d , which was defective . The customer support at New Trent could not have been better , and suggested that I might prefer the IMP500 , unless I needed to charge two devices at the same time.(They also paid for the return shipping . ) I took their advise and am extremely pleased with this model . Also worth noting , the New Trent does not appear to create any " heating " issues with the Evo when using the Evo while it charging . The New Trent is a must - have for anyone who needs to be sure they will always have a way to power their phone when electrical outlets or car chargers are not an option . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### Nice phone , has alot of features , including a built in mp3 player , camera , internet etc . great for work and checking emails on the run .
1 #### This will not fit into a 12v power outlet . The end is too long ( appears to only be designed to fit into deeper cigarette lighters ) . It just keeps falling out . Tried it in three different cars ( none have cigarette lighters ) - would not work in any of the 12v outlets .
5 #### Heavier than I imagined , good quality , pretty design which is on both sides of the outside , and you can see the reverse of it on the inside - exactly what I expected from the pic and description . Arrived shockingly quickly . I 'm very happy with my purchase !
5 #### I 've been moving toward heavier strings on my electrics , but I find the plain 3rd on an .011 set to be still and uncomfortable . The wound 3rd in this set is much nicer to play . I play about half acoustic and half electric in a set . When I switch from an acoustic with .012s to an electric with .010s , I have to adjust my technique ; so I started using heavier electric strings to make the transition easier . It helps a lot , but I also notice that the beefier strings sound better through magnetic pickups . ( I was using D'Addario EXL110 before , which are made from the same material , so the sonic difference is purely due to the heavier gauge . ) I was n't expecting that , so better tone is a goody - grab - bag extra . If you have a good setup , the heavier gauge is no harder to play in my opinion . If you 've never tried .011s on your electric , I encourage you to do so . You might be pleasantly surprised , as I was .
5 #### Great price for super slinky strings . I 've been using these for years and really appreciate the durability of these and how bright they are for weeks of playing . Highly recommend .
4 #### good stuff for a neat lighting job inside a closet
5 #### Gave it to my brother - not because the first one broke ! I 've had it for a year now - and not ONCE did it ever give me a problem - watch the matrix regularly . I get rental DVD 's ( more scratched - usually " more difficult to play " ) about twice a week - and in the last 6 months of renting so frequently I have never had a disc that gave me a problem . Overall , I think there 's no reason to buy a more expensive DVD player - like cd players , they 're one and the same unless you 're really descriminate about quality or features not detectable to an average consumer .
3 #### gave it has a birthday present they really enjoyed it , fits most of the their phone , easy to carry thanks
2 #### Not worth it . I already lost one of these . Pay more and getter the better one . These do n't stay on the plug very well . Fit loose . And then then large loop that connects to the wire that 's supposed to be a retainer ( when not covering the plug ) is also too loose . Completely fell off a couple times in the driveway before I lost it completely . So it fails to protect the plug from the elements , therefore fails in its purpose .
5 #### This power cord for my blackjack is perfect fit just like the OEM one that i have at home .
5 #### The power cleaner cleans well and sprays well , and the oil sprays nice and evenly . I just washed my filter in the sink ... probably should n't have , but I did .
5 #### Stable and precise pick attack . Excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player . I am buying more gauges too . They last forever .
2 #### You have to take your iphone out of the case to fit in the speaker . The speakers damper the sound . I 'm going to return this product . I wish this product was better quality .
5 #### I bought this and ended up selling the phone so I did not use it much , but while I had it I really liked the look and fit . The only thing for me that I did n't care for was the glossy plastic parts on the back . I have the same case for the Galaxy Note 2 and the plastic on it is a matte finish which looks much nicer . I really like the firmness of the materials and how solid it feels . Overall a great looking case .
5 #### I bought this to extend my headphone chord for when I am practicing music , the coiled chord helps keep it out of the way while giving me room to move .
5 #### I had a couple of pairs of the original K240 's , and though these feel slightly cheaper , they 're actually a whole lot cheaper ( in price ) . I once bought a pair of $ 30 Samson headphones that broke after about a year because they were made of such cheap plastic . The K240 design , intact in this incarnation , seems to hold up really well over time . How do they sound ? Great . Neutral , not bass heavy , not hyped in the highs . I like them . I also have a pair of K701 's , and the K240s sound slightly duller and less extension in the low lows , but I use them for tracking ( and making mic placement decisions ) without hesitation .
5 #### A bit expensive , but the sound is exquisite and the strings last a lot longer than others . You get what you pay for .
5 #### Excellent quality as always , a good softness for someone just starting or getting back into , very forgiving .
5 #### This is an excellent starter camera for anyone who does n't want the best resolution of pictures . Basically , if you are going to use this camera to send pictures over the net you will be set . If you plan on printing and framing themm , then you better step it up . Yes , it [ uses ] up batteries but so does every other digital camera ! This is a great camera for the $ $ $ and will get you started . Plus you get a 8 MB card to store pictures , and if that is n't enough you can pick up a 16 MB card at certain auction sights ( ... ) All in all , it is an excellent camera if you do n't want to spend hundreds .
4 #### These strings are the second best set of strings on the market . The best are the GHS - Boomers gauge 0.10-0.46.no other strings can compare with it 's brightness in pitch and beautiful tones these strings produce .
4 #### it appears insignificant but does a really good job of pulling in signals . highly recommended .
4 #### This Vakoo iPhone 5S phone case is strong , sturdy , and made of hard plastic with a silicone lining that helps cushion the phone . The thickest concentration of silicone is at the four corners of the phone , which tend to be where most damage occurs if the phone is dropped . In particular , I really enjoy the stand because it is easy to use whether you want your phone in a horizontal or vertical position . The stand is very simple and consists of a flap on the back outer shell of the case . Having used it several times , I have not noticed it getting loose or warped . All of the physical buttons on the phone are easy to access . The locking and volume buttons are covered by formed buttons in the silicone lining . The mute switch and home button are open as are the bottom speakers and lightning port . One weakness I do see is the lip of the case at the very bottom front between the home button and the lightning port . That part of the case is very thin and could break or at least bent out of shape from continued use ( putting it in and out of a pocket , for example ) . Nevertheless I would still recommend it based on my personal experience to date .
2 #### Finally needed to use this piece but only 2 of the sockets work . Disappointed I paid for something I needed with 4 ports and only half works ! Would not buy this again and not trust it .
5 #### was better for me than use the cell phone company insurance , was my best option
5 #### I see this thing in a lot of music videos , it has a distinctive shape . I 'm sure there are other brands of good quality . I know this thing works and with my knowledge of manufacturing it is well constructed and should last many years . I was suspicious of the low price but material wise there is not much to these , the price is right . Read the instructions that come with it , some negative reviews are clear the instructions were not consulted .
5 #### Incredible headphones . I also have a pair of HD 558s and these 600s blow them out of the water in clarity . To get the full potential out of these headphones you 're gon na need a good dac / amp . The difference is night and day .
5 #### I 've been using Super Slinkies since the late 1960 's . Still the best strings . I 've tried others , but always come back to Super Slinky 9 's . Comfortable , easy to bend , they 're the best .
2 #### at first - this was great , but after a while , the flexible arm would not stay in the same position ( would keep falling in ) . The little piece that holds the phone that clips on to the flexible arm would fall off occasionally dropping the phone into the floor . I ended up just taking the whole thing down because i got tired of fixing it all the time .
5 #### Pretty much the only neckstrap I 've ever owned . Can be a bit cumbersome , but it 's worth it for how comfortable it is . Would not recommend in hot weather ; gets really sweaty and nasty . But especially great for long rehearsals or practice sessions .
5 #### Ca n't beat these coated strings . Add a lot of longevity to the life of strings , and give a nice resonating sound as well . Very high quality .
4 #### I guess I 'm one of the lucky ones . Yes , the darn thing was a pain to install . Did my homework first with the factory manuals for my Lumina . Then I trained to be a contorchounist(sp ? ) to get under the left dash . Worked right off . 400 feet ? No way . But , I did not route the yellow antenea wire in any special place . As long as it will start from my house to the garage . The only thing worth mentioning is I had to replace the remote transmiter recently ( after six years ) . My Lumina did NOT have remote door locks so that is worth the $ $ $ and effort !
4 #### I have a few HOSA cables . They do the job . I have had one or two break after a few years and there is no way to repair them , but at the price it works .
5 #### Great DSLR Bag , I bougth this bag for use with a Nikon D3200 and the bag is perfect for the camera size with the lens attached and one telephoto len aditional . One thing more , the protection is excellent A+ .
5 #### As the material states , " no cutting is required ! " I bought what I hope will be several months worth in 3 sets of the 5 - per set . At a great price and very easy to install , just make sure you 're in as dust proof an area as you can be when putting these or any screen covers on ! These do go on very easily and look and fit great ! I 've had the ones before that were ' close ' to the right size and you need to trim a bit off to get the right fit a little more right , but all I 've used so far and in all the sets I have they look pre - cut perfectly ! So , if your one of the multitudes of Samsung Captivate owners like me I highly recommend these screen covers if you use screen covers !
1 #### This did n't last ... The joints came loose , the suction gave out and the whole thing turned to junk within just a few months .
5 #### My old Motorola Razr cell phone had been washed accidentially in a load of laundry . When I retreived it , it was dead and apparently it had a shorted and unusuable battery . I put the phone away and forgot about it until just recently when my new ( Replacement for the washed one ) died . I needed a backup until I could receive another phone so I took the old Razr out of the closet and put the battery out of the replacement phone , that was not working , and put it into the old Razr . Lo and behold , the old phone worked great with a new battery and 2 years of drying out . Only problem was that the original battery did not hold a charge because of water damage . I found a battery locally at Walmart and was astounded that the price for the battery was $ 28 . I began looking online and came upon my old friend , Amazon . I found an EXACT replacement , manufactured by Motorola the maker of the cell phone , for a fraction of the price of the one at Walmart . I placed the order and within a few days , I had my new battery . I put it into the original phone and I 've been using it now for a couple of months with no problems . Thank you Amazon and their partner , the company that actually shipped the battery .
5 #### 64 MB on something not much larger than a commemorative postage stamp ! Science fiction -- right here , right now ! I still remember when a 5 MB Winchester ( hard disk ) cost $ 5,000 and more people used cassette drives with their 6800 's than had diskette drives ( with a whopping 160 K of storage ) . This card works just fine with my Creative Labs Nomad II MG . It holds about an hour of music , depending on how well the MP3s compressed . No complaints , except cost . And I ca n't really believe that I 'm grousing about $ 1 / MB for a flash disk ! Get one for your MP3 player . Get one for your camera . Get a bunch ! Now , if I could just find a good storage case for these -- I'd hate to lose the little guys ...
5 #### What can I say about this product ? It was well worth the price , it works perfectly as a replacement charger for my son 's phone , it 's durable and as specified .
5 #### Priced right , fit the Droid Incredible perfectly . Too bad I returned the phone . The Droid Incredible was an amazing toy and a lousy phone .
5 #### These provide excellent sound , comfort and they are fairly durable . A very good sound experience for the price .
5 #### Perfect for my wife 's new bass . Now she does n't have to worry so much about it falling off . Now , if she can just keep from banging the head around ... LOL
4 #### Easy to Install . Fits well . Does what its suppose to .
3 #### I put these on my wifes minivan where space was limited . They never threw a great light pattern , fog and driving lights being pretty similiar with the clear lenses & focusing either is next to impossible . I paid 40 dollars for my set and they 've lasted 2 years now but I just noticed one of the lenses took a road debris hit and cracked . I would buy them again but not for 50 dollars . I also will look around first . For tight spaces they are good enough and look kinda cool . Do nt expect hella quality from them though . UPDATE 2/20/10 . Both lights have cracks , one bulb died within weeks ( replaced fairly easily ) so they are still working . I have replacement units ( different lights ) but wo n't swap them until these finally die . I still wish Hella did a better Quality Control job on these . These are an average value in my book , not great .
5 #### Great product that not only gives that amazing yellow / orange light that cuts through fog rain and snow it also protects your expensive glass lenses better than the grill guards .
5 #### Installed it in my American Special Strat and it worked .
5 #### Our new battery from eCom means that I no longer hear " system trouble , low battery " when I set or unset our house alarm . The best part is that it arrive AHEAD of the promised delivery date . How often does that happen ? Great service and great price , I 'll be buying replacement UPS batteries from them as well !
5 #### The question for me was does this work on Kindle 2 . YES or NO ? Answer for me is yes , at least on my equipment ( nothing proprietary ) . Works fine for data and charging on Kindle 2 . I use a lot of these retractable cables to keep my desk a bit cleaner from cable clutter and make traveling easier . This looks just like a retractable from another seller ( not all ) so maybe there is a factory making these for multiple companies . Because these are retractable the cable might be smaller , just be careful to pull on plug not the cable when removing .
5 #### amazing ! love them . they have grip to them so they wo n't go flying out of your hand ! update : the logo wears off pretty fast , maybe its because I play a lot but I still expected it to stay on longer . Great picks though . worth the money for sure ! !
5 #### I 've used the standard picks for years and tried one of these . I love having the bigger area under my finger and thumb . I 'm a classic rock and blues player and this thickness works well for me . I also use them when I play bass . Pop for a few bucks and get a dozen to try out . I think you 'll like them , too .
5 #### A while ago I gave this product a 2/5 and basically crapped on it because I misunderstood what I wanted from it . I had figured that this product , touting its " EMI / RFI attenuation " , would eliminate the interference I was experiencing on my studio monitors , and was quite upset when it failed to deliver . A year or so later , I managed to finally fix the interference by fixing an issue entirely unrelated to the power supply . Oops . I was prepared to just throw a 4/5 at this by way of apology and call it even , but I actually ended up buying a couple more of these when I needed to find a road - portable power strip that I would n't have to babysit or worry about . ... on second thought , maybe it 's not entirely worry - free : I 'd be plenty concerned about the well - being of anything that collides with this monster . If you 're looking for an absolute tank of a power strip ( or an armor - piercing flail ) and do n't foolishly expect it to perform and miracles beyond " provides six grounded surge - protected sockets while being indestructible " , look no further , Furman 's got you .
5 #### The best twelve - Dollar investment in D300 accessories , stows nicely in the camera bag . The laminated folding cards are very sturdy and will hold together for years on end . If they put spiral binding it may scratch the expensive contents of the camera bag . This is a lovely , color coded guide or cheat sheet that will keep you alive when you are in the field , away from the 450 + pages manual that is not very portable , yet indispensable for such a vastly complex camera . I 'm so happy with this quick reference . Maybe a tad larger font would have been in order , but I wo n't chuck it away just because of that .
5 #### This is a good product at a good price . I like using the long cable with one of the conversion jacks on my headphones to listen to my home theater sound system when I do n't want to disturb my wife . It works very well . I have n't used any of the other jacks yet . So I ca n't write about them . I can recommend this product .
5 #### Extremely happy with this product . My 5th wheel is a 04 ' and has smooth sides but the whole trailer was oxidized and foggy white . After using on the back on my trailer I am very happy
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Boomers . They are bright but not harsh , and are consistent in manufacture , pack - to - pack . I 've never been let down by these strings , for either my basses or my guitars . The red silk on these grips the machines well ( and looks cool ) , and once they have been broken in they stay in tune . These strings are equally at home on a Precision or a Jazz . If you play a lot of mellow , upright - bass - style jazz , they might be a bit bright for you , but for 90 % of what most people play , these strings deliver . If you are looking for good bass strings , and you are comparing lots of brands and do n't really know which ones to get , try these . I 've been playing guitar and bass for 25 + years and GHS Boomers are my favorite , by far .
5 #### Good quality stand . However , it needs to be about a half inch shorter when I use my 13"x6 " snare drum !
5 #### Works like a charm with my 5D MKIII and computer monitor .
5 #### have had this kind of lights for over 3 years now.just great for some extra light normal and off road driving
5 #### have n't got it yet but I know I am going to love it
5 #### 4 computers networked over distances of up to 150 feet . Used existing phone lines . Easy setup , very fast , does not interfere with other phone uses . Drawback is no simple way ( that I have found ) to share a broadband connection . Linksys tech assistance quite limited . Internet sharing software included with system outdated and not upgradable and not supported by software publisher .
1 #### One of the most important pieces of information when your buying a cable is the LENGTH ! ! ! Hello handhelditems and/or Amazon . List the length ! Now I have to buy another dang cable because not only was the length not listed I was in to much of hurry to buy a DIFFERENT cable ! Had I not been in a hurry I would not have bought it . There is no length listed ! ! I say to everyone out there do n't buy this . When they wonder why there dang cable is n't selling maybe they 'll learn to slow down and display the IMPORTANT information ! !
5 #### I keep this in the a / c port in my armrest . Rapid cell phone charger in the main and a usb going to all passengers in the car . Everybody gets juice if they need it ! !
5 #### a perfectly good file holder - it holds many files . Came quickly and well packaged . five more words are these
2 #### Does n't do much . Water still spots , other products out there are much better for boats .
3 #### This is a good example of why Nokia is losing market share . If you are use to their convolted user interface and way of doing things then it 's ok . Everything works for the most part . The web browser and other web app sucks compared to the other phones . Compared to it 's chief rival Blackberry ... the BB OS 6 is way better in every respect . Ca n't imagine a single reason I would get this phone over an iPhone , Andriod , or BB and I have owned and used all of them .
1 #### I have the version that you can put in powersports vehicles , in this case it was in my Jet Ski . It was purchased in June of 2014 . I noticed last fall that it was n't retaining it 's charges very well . So I let it sit for 4 months and it was charged before removing it from my Ski . I 've tried to charge it several times with two different chargers and one of them was an Optimate 6 which is supposed to help save batteries but it would n't hold a charge . I 'm really baffled at how a battery that is less than two years old can go bad ? ? ? ? These Odyssey batteries and supposed to be able to be stored and not lose any power or go bad , but this was not case for this particular battery . I can not take it back to the dealer I bought it from because I no longer live in that area . Maybe it 's just hype or I just got unlucky ......... but odyssey batteries disappointed me greatly .
5 #### Works well on my silver 350z but a little harder to dry off my black z3 ... Pick your battles wisely . I love my 350z so I love this product , its a simple swipe and we 're good to go . On my black Z3 it takes a few more swipes but it gets the job done and u do n't need 2 - 3 regular towels to do the job .
4 #### Fits my custom Telecaster great . Great basic case . Offers good protection .
3 #### These stylus ' do n't work as well as they should . I think the tip may be too soft for the screen to see it correctly .
5 #### I lead the band at my church . My drummer is a professional and loves this . He gives it five stars .
4 #### This does n't stand up but neither do a lot of hard cases . I really like the zippered compartment on top where I store written lyrics and such .
1 #### There are two stickers on the mask . They DO NOT COME OFF . They are glued to the plastic and if you try to take them off it bubbles and breaks the screen . I went through the first screen and had to take it off . Basically had to try the rest and they did n't work either . Really upset since I spent money for shipping and handling as well as for the product that does not work . Do n't buy it .
1 #### Beautiful hitch cover , but does NOT fit 1 1/4 " hitch , as advertised . I searched all over for 1 1/4 " and thought I had found one . Received it early , just in time to travel to two consecutive away games , but ca n't use . Waiting to see what happens with the $ 13.99 shipping I paid !
4 #### Yes they are good for strumming , you 're just not going to get much volume . Hard to believe they can make them this thin and maintain that Dunlop durability but they do . I 'll use these for my 12 string acoustic but not without amplification . Just not thick enough for good solid sound . I would n't think of using these on an electric , and using them on a bass is out of the question .
2 #### Fit so so , function so so - replaced after 2 weeks . Just not good as good can be . ACase makes a much better minimal phone case , for my mind .
5 #### Tremendous DI box ! Very much better Than I hoped . You do n't have to spend too much to own a good DI . Congrats whirlwind !
4 #### Original packaging and delivered exactly as promised . Little difficulty when putting on for the first time , but you get used to it quickly . In Illinois you must have hands free while talking and driving , figured it saved me $ 100 ticket . Well worth the price .
5 #### We have a Sony HD Handycam and it fits great in this case with the exception of the cable - it would be nice to roll the power cord in with the camcorder but there is simply no room to put it in there because of the tight fit .
5 #### Originally bough clear one from Cingular . Could not reach the keyboard buttons close to the edge because covered by case . This one fit better and did not have that problem . Has been durable and lasted well .
5 #### My old battery would nt last that long . This new one is exactly the same and has extendedthe battery life greatly . For about $ 4 shipped its a good investment for a great phone . The selller OEM Planet was great as well .
5 #### Nice size fan when compared to cheaper models available on the road . Nice to get a breeze without having to run noisy generator . Bought a 12 foot 12 volt cord that lets me move fan around the rv that only has two power outlets .
4 #### for a product made for a Jeep , I would have expected it not to crack while I was handling it .
1 #### I have ordered two of these cases previously and they are nice , well - made cases . I ordered another one , this time from SF Planet , and received it today , but it was not the case I ordered . They substituted a cheap , poorly - made , non - leather case with a very weak belt clip that my iphone will not even fit into . My other cases were from Bargain Cell . Buyer beware if ordering from SF Planet ! ! ! !
1 #### Not a good product . This is cheaply made and way to bulky . I bought this for my bluetooth headset case and i regret it . Just crappy plastic . It also has no click control for the turning on your belt so it constantly turns and rotates on it 's own . I hope this helps !
5 #### Excellent product and high quality . I would definitely buy again . Especially like the weather proof cover and heavy duty flange .
5 #### I was originally looking for Mogami Silver cables when I found these . I saved a ton of money and got some great cables as well . I am now in the process of switching all of my cables to Planet Waves . I really like how the ends fit tight on these cables into whatever I am plugging them into . I am sure there are better cables but you probably would need the hearing of a bat to tell the difference . There are a lot of bad XLR cables out there , but these are NOT them .
4 #### they seem to work fine ... only tried one but it works without issue ( I ordered one or two extra just to have around so i would n't have to re - order and wait for a package )
3 #### This stand is pretty good . It seems sturdy ( does n't want to tip back or over ) , folds up nicely , seems like it has good padding and the guitar does n't slide around a lot . There is ONE thing I do n't like it about it . If you have a Les - Paul style guitar , one of the arms that cradle the guitar on the bottom is EXACTLY where the cable jack is located . So you either have to lean your guitar one way or the other if you put it on the stand while plugged in , which is pretty frequently for me . Kind of annoying !
4 #### This worked perfectly in the hitch receiver of my 2015 Chevy Colorado . I purchased a CURT splitter and have this plugged into the splitter leaving the stock 4 pin port open . It 's gotten moisture in it a few times from the car wash but i usually pop the lens off and clean it every couple of months .
5 #### Just give me a good AM / FM radio that performs . The Superadio III does exactly that ! The AM is so potent it 's like having AM shortwave - so MANY stations can be found - all over the USA . The first night I ran it through it 's capabilities , from NC we were clear receptioned in Chicago , Miss , Cleveland , NY , and other places that did n't identify . Great trip . And the FM reception is exceptional too and the sound is clear , rich and full . Yes , it 's on the bulky side , not many bells and whistles , but for the price , it 's a real champ . Trying to convince my wife to get another one . When it was suggested she could use that one for outside ; battle won . Great radio ! P.S. If your battery compartment clips on your super Superadio 111 do n't all snap into place , and if you have n't thought of it yet , fold a small piece of paper and wedge it into the ' V ' of the offending clip(s ) and voil , the compartment is closed tightly . Now it 's a 5 star radio !
5 #### Use it to wax my RV , excellent choice for my Porter - Cable buffer .
5 #### This cable splitter is exactly what I needed . Great price and great quality !
5 #### I would definatly recommend this item to anyone who wishes to connect standard usb thumb drives and external drives to tablets and phones with the micro usb ports . Tested and confirmed that I was able to connect a 4 port usb hub to my 10 inch yoga tablet and use a regular keyboard and mouse along with an external hard drive to do some work on the fly . Great Product . Great Price .. Jump on it while its available !
5 #### Great for drying my motorcycle in the hard to reach places .
5 #### I bought two sets of these heads , one for the batters on one drum kit , and a second set for the resonant sides on another drum kit . Evans G1 ( and also G2 ) drum heads are exemplary . I would nt use anything else . Oh i have tried Remo 's , and Aquarian , etc . Over the years i have tried a bunch . I play on the side in a six - piece wedding band , who just happens to rock out at the clubs every so often , so i get to play hard and soft , fast and slow - and everything in between . i have one drum set at rehearsal , and one is packed up for the road . Both with Evans heads all the way around . Which reminds me : the Evans EMAD bass drum batter head is also hands - down the coolest sounding bass drum head i have ever heard . Do yourself a favor , get some Evans G1 's or G2 's . I have n't tried the new G12 's yet , but it 's early yet . Go forth , young son and check out Evans G1 tompack . Nice
4 #### Great except the vinyl chase does n't extend all the way to the connector , leaving sev we rally inches of wire unprotected . Also does n't look as sharp as it could with wires exposed .
5 #### These pickups are unbelievably good for the price . I purchased them for my own " Frankenstrat " project guitar ( alder body ) & could n't be happier . Combined with the beefed - up Fender Mexi Tremelo Bridge that I installed , the sound is bright & clear with a ton of sustain . My favorite switch settings for these are in positions 2 and 4 , as they provide a nice bluesy type of sound . These over - wound pickups provide a lot of character and clarity with a reasonable amount of 60Hz hum in the 1 , 3 , & 5 positions , considering they are not a noiseless design . If they were $ 115 , I would still feel that they offered good value for the money . But at $ 69 , there 's no need to think twice about it .
4 #### the cost is too high for such a product .. because u have no alternative , u are compelled to buy it .... or do without .... the readings are approximate , not direct ... I feel I have paid too much ....
5 #### As with all of Tamrac 's products it is inexpensive and well made . This is the 5th Tamrac bag that I have bought for various cameras that I have . The first one I bought is still holding up almost 10 years later .
5 #### These have worked amazingly for a year . For studio and personal use ! Love them !
4 #### A must have when doing body work . Been around forever- will probably be around forever . A must have for the smoothest finish .
5 #### I got this last week ... It 's very cute & I love it ! Everyone asks if I " bedazzled " my blackberry LOL .... A few of the stones came off ONLY beacuse I dropped it , totally my fault . I 'm back today to buy more bling :) so I can change the covers to match my outfits ! j / k
1 #### Worst strings I have ever used . I put these on a high quality Taylor and the sound was all midrange . No full sounds , no brightness , no projection . I am returning to D"Addarios . These strings sounds worse than completely dead strings .
4 #### I 'm not the guy who is looking for the super - fancy , multi - function iPhone type of handset . I just needed something with simple web browsing ability and all the basic functions of a cell phone . I do n't like flips or sliders or any of those mechanical lever type phones , I only like these candybar type phones so my options are kind of limited . This phones meets and exceeds my expectations as far as features go . Came with a 2 GB chip which I found impressive . The phone works well , reception is good , bluetooth works perfectly with my blueant , web browsing is fast as heck for a little phone not really designed for it . Overall , I 'm very happy with the phone . The only down side for me is that the buttons are a little small and not separated enough so I often push the wrong buttons when texting . The reason I 'm giving this 4 stars instead of five is because some of the menu systems are a little funky and go against logic . I get frustrated with it a little too often , but overall , the phone is great . It 's SUPER thin , sometimes I ca n't find it in my pocket which is just how I like it . It 's actually a powerful little phone for the money , I definitely recommend it .
3 #### I had to return them because there not for a truck with cladding . They looked very durable and easy to put on . I wish they showed that in the title it would of saved me $ 6 in returned shipping
3 #### It works well , but it seems like it is not as snug as it should be . I just hope it stays covered and protects the wire harness that frequently gets corrosion .
2 #### The strap is rough and uncomfortable against the skin when worn for long periods of time . The edges of the strap are not smooth and start cutting into the skin .
5 #### Great lights ! A lot smaller than the old school KC lights . These fit in tighter places and look good mounted ..... Wiring was easy and had simple directions with everything you need to hook the lights up ........ relays & fuses are included ....
3 #### I bought a lot better stick on , this is not that good . I bought other stick on before and Incan say that this is not as sticky as the ounces I used before
5 #### These are O.K. but old technology o I may not use them much
5 #### it was exactly what was shown on the site , the fit was great also . It was worth every penny I spent
5 #### A great gun for the price i use it aroung the house all the time on riding lawn mower i 'm very satisfied with it .
5 #### needed a fog machine for lasers , its small , does what i need it to do
5 #### This is a must for these phones . Executive and professional look . It 's a great buy , great price , Blackberry OEM . Recommended .
3 #### I would n't buy this item again . Two reasons . 1 . Still to small , 20 qts would be better and 2 . It does n't have a vent plug , so when the oil drains from your oil pan into the funnel the air is trying to get out as the oil want 's in . You get a bubbling effect which splashes small oil drops every where . I end up draining into a regular oil pan and transferring to this container for transport . I guess I was spoiled . I had a large oil container that heald about 20 to 25 qts with a vent plug . I could easily do my bmw ( 6.5 qts ) gmc ( 7 . qts ) and civic ( 4 qts ) . But sadly it sprung a leak after 15 yrs and I had to put it down .
5 #### I was skeptical , but this is the BEST chamois - type cloth I have ever used . I like it so much , I should sell it at a booth at the county fair !
3 #### These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise . I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot . These will snap off fast . It did n't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim / head hit . if these are for a electric kit , I would give these a 5 star for that perpose
5 #### Bought this for my wife over a year ago . Was just looking at it the other day , and I was amazed at how well it has held up . It is still in great condition , and protects the phone well .
5 #### I use the bag with my Canon 5D + 4 lens ( 70 - 200L , 24 - 70L , 16 - 35L and 85 mm ) and a flash and that pretty much fills up the primary storage area . The adjustable pads made it easy to lay everything out , but it is packed tight . Carrying the equipment when its in the bag is much easier on my shoulders than my old Domke shoulder bag . I do n't have much of a problem with getting the camera out and changing lens as I do n't often change lens when I 'm on the run ( usually when I want to swap lens frequently is when I 'm standing still taking lots of pictures of some event such as a sporting event ) . Secondary storage area is great for carrying other stuff -- book , snacks , video camera ( small ) , etc . Very happy with the bag . Much preferred over my old shoulder bag .
5 #### My cousin came to visit me and brought this item to me . He said that he did n't understand why one would need such a device . But a power outage when his phone was on its last legs changed his mind . This item is so functional I find it indispensable in my daily " carry kit " . It has a flash light and ... a laser pointer ? I 'm not going to go there . It 's good for one full charge but that 's all you 'll need in an emergency situation . I have n't checked how fast it looses it 's charge but I hope it 's able to sustain it for a reasonable period of time . All in all , a very handy tool .
5 #### I just bought a number of these from Amazon , and these cables are great . They are well made and reasonably priced .
5 #### This works and operates better than the Apple car charger and cost a lot less . I would buy it again
5 #### Works great , fits better . Works with a range of headsets . I use it with a jawbone iciness and a jabra extreme . The gels are comfortable , and fit quite well . Before buying these I was seriuosly thinking of a custoel . Th ese are almost the well fitting . Biggest issue is that the material hardens and may need replaced in about 6 months , but for the price I can live with that .
5 #### I used to have these along time ago . When I first got them , they were better than my other headphones I used to own . These headphones have some serious bass and treble , and DJ 's still use these headphones . They are great for part 15 broadcasting , and hosting holiday parties when queing up a song . They are good for remixing , shuffling music , and running a small FM or AM station . Also these headphones are good for the shortwave radio listener and ham radio operator . They are the best ! I hope I can get another pair soon .
5 #### My wife and I are getting to the point we do n't hear as well as we used to . I bought 2 and with these we can communicate together a lot easier . When I am at work I can use the amplification feature to communicate with others . These are regular amplifiers in this case , not the selective frequency ones like my hearing aids but for my use I could get by with these for a lot lower price . I usually wear One of these and one of the OTE hearing aids that way I have the best of both worlds . Everyones needs are different but for me they work great .
3 #### Seems to hold power a long time . I had left it powered on , paired to my Nokia cell phone and I threw it in a drawer . A couple weeks later I could not figure out why my cell phone was n't pairing to my over - head headset . Turns out it had paired to the Plantronics in the drawer . Is n't compatible with all cell phones older 3 years , so check for compatibility . Manufacturers do a poor job of testing and publishing compatibility information .
4 #### Wonderful little pouch . Nice imitation leather , very roomy for iphone or any horizontal phone and fits with the phone 's case as well with no difficulty taking the phone out when needed . It clips nicely to any pant material and does not add any extra weight . For the price it is a steal .
5 #### Fitting was needed to connect the vacuum pump to a R-134a system . Fit very well .
5 #### Here is your basic no thrills case for your bluetooth Headset . IMHO you need something to put your bluetooth into , and here it is . It stretches out , front and back are hard , and elastic holds the sides together with a velcro close on the top that stretches over . On the back is a metal clamp to clip onto your belt or such .
5 #### I was looking for a grab bar that did not look industrial . This one is nice looking and functional . The satin nickel finish is attractive and the design works well as the bar can be grabbed from more than one direction . Just what I was looking for .
5 #### Always my favorite . As the the " Red Hot " lady says ... I put that sh@t in everything . Lawn mowers , diesel trucks , gas cars , and small engines . It makes ethanol easy to manage .
5 #### Boy , does this thing move some air ! I put it on the step up to the bed in our truck camper , right in front of the " pass through " window and it cools the camper down quickly . It 's really quite quiet too ... great investment !
2 #### Might be a good product , but it is not universal as stated . Did not work on my 1975 Pontiac Grandville .
4 #### I had bought 2 of these for my home server and one of the 2 failed . AMAZON was awesome and ' overnighted ' me a replacement drive . I sent Amazon the request to replace the drive around 4:00 p.m. one day and the new one was in my hands around 10:00 a.m. the next morning . If that 's not great service , I dpn't know what is . + after getting the replacement drive the remaining 2 drives work fantastic . Thanks , Amazon !
3 #### Perfect fit for the Samsung Alias . Holds a good charge , better than alternative battery purchased from elsewhere . Straight replacement battery , not extended life . Does NOT require optional replacement back cover .
2 #### Do n't waste your money on this piece of $ $ $ * * * , TRIED TO USE IT TO JACK UP MY GARDEN TRACTOR , OK IT JACKED IT UP ... TURNED AROUND TO GRAB A WRENCH , AND IT WAS ALMOST TWO INCHES LOWER AND STILL SINKING , CHECKED THE OIL - IT WAS FULL .... TIGHTED THE HANDLE VALVE AS TIGHT AS I COULD WITHOUT USING A PIPE WRENCH ON IT ... NOPE ............ JUNK CHINA $ $ $ * * * GOT ME AGAIN .... GRAB YOUR ANKLES ... IF YOU BUY IT ....
5 #### The Wiremold C110 White Cordmate Kit is perfect for hiding unsightly wires along baseboard or up a wall . It is paintable
5 #### Great case my husband loves it so much he brought 4
5 #### All the stores around here were selling pathetic combo locks I had to return . This works great .
5 #### I have this APS750 inverter set up to take the load from the return pump on my saltwater tank . It works every time the power goes out , and with the battery I have hooked up to it , can get several hours running time(approx 175 watt pump ) . Would definitely purchase this again .
5 #### My third order of this stand cause its my favorite stand and I just keep buying more zildjian cymbals .
5 #### For the price this is a great Headset , I use the 510 headset from plantronics , and bought this one for my wife . She really do n't use it much , but I 've linked it up to 2 different cell phones and my laptop , worked great . It is a little bulkier and heavier than the 510 . Other than that it is simple and is a great buy if you do n't need the multilink capability of the 510 .
3 #### Inconsistent performance . I ordered two and no longer using either of them .
4 #### I just ca n't fathom how a dry tape can clean all that well . I also wonder how this can clean the record heads being that it never has you press the record button ( probably does n't clean the record heads is my guess ) However it is by far the simplest to use ! Even my Mom could do it ! That 's got to be worth something . I think I 'll give it to my Mom !
5 #### it is a ok . it fit me good . I will call again in the near future . i am very glad
5 #### I bought this from Costco a few weeks ago and it comes with the adapter to charge the speakerphone at home . Paired with my iPhone no problem . On the streets , I can hear callers no problem and they say I sound great . On the highway , it is a little more difficult to hear and just depends on how quiet your cabin is . I like the overall look of the device and the I have n't had to charge mine yet . I 'm very happy with my purchase .
3 #### Does not work for iPhone 6 , but works for 4S
5 #### Nothing wrong with this product . Works great and it is what they said it was . Good brand brings good products .
5 #### Easy on the fingers and sounds great . I 've been a loyal d'addario customer for years and have n't had any trouble . I use this for my Ibanez RG4 ( floating trem ) and I use a phosphorous bronze for accoustic . Sounds bright !
5 #### Oh my ... What have I been missing ? Listened to Thunderstruck when I unwrapped them and I want to cry because it sounds so good . This is sickness in a headset .
5 #### big bag for lots of stuff . held up very very well .
5 #### I was really surprised at the amount of tools that comes with this kit . For $ 10 , this has everything that you need to replace a cracked screen . Make sure you read the instructions or watch a YouTube video before attempting to fix it yourself . The glass works really well and the digitizer that comes with it works just like the OEM . I was able to replace the screen in a cafe in a little over 1 hour ( it took a while to separate the old glass ) . The quality is amazing . This kit also comes with a guitar pick . You 're probably wondering , why would I need that ? However , you 'll see later that it becomes really useful when you 're trying to separate the glass / digitizer from the metal frame . This comes with a screwdriver , separating tool , guitar pick , some other little tools that I did n't need to use , the glass and digitizer . Other sites sell similar products for about $ 25 . Amazon has the best deal if you have Amazon Prime for free shipping .
4 #### Stereo does fit in this adapter . However , I had to take things off of the stereo to make it work .
5 #### I have been using this car charger for awhile and have had no problems with it . I was very satisfied with the performance and price . I read many reviews before purchasing this one .
5 #### Great price , exactly as described . Not much to say ; they 're just report covers .
5 #### Killer strings , perfect for blues , heavy rhythm strings and nice bendable , tone full lead strings , they sound great much better then the GHS Gilmour strings I have been buying , these are my new go to set , buying in bulk from here on out ... dont know why I ever went to GHS , D'Addario blows them away ..... love the EXL140 's
5 #### Just what I needed for the problem I had . I would recommend it for those who have a need of a power strip .
5 #### Awesome sticks , love the diameter and the feel of these sticks , highly recommend buying and also purchasing pro mark stick rapp for these sticks :)
4 #### These mud flaps look great . they are easy to install . I did not have to drill , just used existing holes . My only wish is that they were an inch or two longer . Other then that . they are perfect .
2 #### This pick holder sticks up too high on my guitar . I prefer those that are flat rather than ergonomically rounded .
5 #### used on my gl1ooo and so far so good bike runs well a must for electric fuel pump low pressure
5 #### I 've had one for years & love it , so got one for my husband who had never heard of them , Now he loves it & uses it all the time .
5 #### Why buy junk when you can get OE products for about the same price ?
4 #### I have been using this headset for a while now . It is lightweight and does not get lost easily like those little toy bluetooth earpieces that hang off your ear . I see people walking around like they have a stiff neck because they are afraid to turn too suddenly or it will fly off and be lost forever . Not this one . Sound quality is very good too , just be sure the boom mic is lowered down to in front of the mouth area . One thing I do n't like about it is the battery saving feature . After about 20 minutes or so of non - use it automatically turns itself off . You can not even wake it up by just a touch of the button . You have to actually hold the power button in for several seconds and power it back up . This takes about 5 seconds to accomplish , then it has to connect to your phone- another 5 - 10 seconds or so . If you are in a conversation on your handset and you want to quickly go to handsfree then you will miss about 10 seconds of conversation while powering up and reconnecting- not very good . A fast power up and fast reconnect would earn this headset a definite 5 star review from me . Otherwise it is a good product and only second to the VXI blue parrot .
3 #### I 've had various PortaPros for years . My kids have them . Even my dad ordered a pair . In a few words : these headphones sound tremendous . However - and this is a big " however " - they 're not built to last . As I stated my family has four sets of these , and every one has been returned - some more than once - because they broke ( usually a channel cuts out ) . While Koss does offer a lifetime guarantee , you still have to shell out nine bucks for replacement . One of my sons just got home from work and - guess what - his PortaPros started acting up on the subway ride home . I want to keep loving the PortaPros , but I ca n't . Time and time again , they 've proved unreliable .
1 #### Unboxed the Nook . Charged it up . Wo n't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will . And it wo n't work at all until you register it . Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue . I 'm calling the B&N tech people . If they ca n't fix it fast then this thing is going back . I did n't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook 's technical problems . I have better things to do . Update : Customer service did n't help . Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they could n't look at it . I figured if the battery ca n't hold a charge for that long than I did n't want the device . The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping . This thing cost me time and money , a bad experience all around . I 'll never buy a B & N product again , certainly not from a third party seller . I 've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony . Hopefully I 'll have better luck
5 #### For the price , it works great . White actually matches my white saddle and black matches my guitar 's finish . And they even give you a spare pin , Thank you !
5 #### This particular valve cover works perfect for my Eb Soprano Cornet . Since no other company makes a cover for a Soprano Cornet I was tickled when I tried it and it fit . Fantastic ! ! Thanks
1 #### It is hard to have anything positive to say about a case that arrived broken . There is a thin strip of the black at the bottom of the case and it arrived broken . The red was a bit more orangey than the picture showed also . I ca n't say how the case worked and it is being returned .
1 #### Does n't provide enough power to use anything . Misrepresents itself . Writing eleven more words because it says i have to . Duh .
5 #### I put these on a motorized bike gas tank and so far they seem to be pretty resistant to gas . Update : It 's been 1.5 years and the decals have held up great !
5 #### I always keep a lot of these on hand . These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars ( strumming style & vocals ) . Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks . These definitely last longer for me than other brands ( similar weight ) that I have used . For example , I can " round - off " the end off a Musician 's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks . The weight is great for my style of playing . They seem more durable than other brands . They 're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand . I love 'em , use them daily , and rely on them ! ! !
5 #### Works great - use on an imac computer used for guests in a hotel lobby ... so far so good , and it does n't stick out like a sore thumb ...
1 #### Did not work at all , had to replace it with a different cable . Waste of money even though it was cheap !
4 #### Very fast and easy to use . Expanded my USB ports in a matter of seconds .
5 #### My original goal to purchase this unit was to enhance the flash effect from the built - in flash on my EOS 7 . But I found it provides not only more output power in flash , but also assistance on AF . As you know , EOS 7 's AF is almost blind in dark environment . Once the unit is mounted , then my EOS 7 can do auto - focus in dark as quickly and precisely as in bright . Although it has only auto setting , it is powerful enough for me to use under most circumstance .
5 #### Bought these for my wife who is allergic to latex so most headphones with the latex " leather " looking headphones are no good for her . These are foam and they work well for her and have excellent sound , way better than the last foam pair that we bought at the store . Great job Panasonic !
5 #### Excellent strength . Wo n't loosen by themselves however you can remove them with any pliers .
5 #### Product is good quality and does what it 's designed to do .
5 #### I wish they were cheaper but perfect for underwater photos !
5 #### If you 're looking for a well made heavy duty fuse holder for automotive , marine , ATV , Etc . then this is the one you want . Well made with integral dust / moisture cap . Bought it from Googol Shop who 's service , prices , and delivery were excellent . AAA+++
5 #### really good cover case for iPhone 3gs . it scratches easy but very comfortable as it is as slim as described . so thank you very much
1 #### Luckily this is only used to store a particular guitar in my house but this bag is barely more than a cheap dust cover . Very little padding . I would n't trust to take it out with a band and risk it getting tossed around too harshly . For the money it works but not really impressed . I expected a bit more from Epiphone .
5 #### NOT TO THICK STILL GET A GOOD LOW END PUNCH !
4 #### I bought this in conjunction with the Netgear FS-108 switch and had planned on selling it later , but decided to keep it after reading more about all the features it has . It 's extremely easy to set up . One side plugged into out cable modem , the other into our hub . Once I reconfigured a machine to use DHCP and rebooted , I was able to access the router 's web - based configuration wizard . After a few screens , the router was ready to go and I was surfing the web . Whole setup from box to surfing was five minutes . The web interface offers only the most basic configuration . For a more geek - level config , you 'll need to telnet into the router . Luckily the telnet menus are layed out well and are easy to navigate . After a bit more configuring , I 'm able to send inbound DNS and SMTP requests to our Linux machine and HTTP requests to our Windows 2000 machine . Only problem I had was my Windows 2000 machine not being able to get an IP address using DHCP . Very minor though , since DHCP is not required and you can configure your machines with static IP addresses . Overal , I 'm extremely impressed and satisified with this router .
5 #### A very good low priced cable , just as good as the ones I payed more that double the price at local stores . Will buy again .
5 #### Amazing what this did after I wet - sanded out the orange peel off of my hood .
5 #### A good solid pair of headphones . I use them to workout in . They are firm on the head and sound great .
5 #### Works . Plugged into my MBP and Dell monitor with DVI . Do n't know if it will break in one year , but looks pretty well built - thick cable and solid joints .
5 #### Bought my first pair of the MDRV6 in the late 80s . There 's a reason why they are still being built and sold today . They sound incredible .
5 #### I used these for a concert and they worked perfectly , unfortunately the binoculars were the highlight of the show .... but that tidbit is for a different review .
5 #### I have used d'addario for a number of years . I 'm not hot about their acoustic , but electric ... they're a whole new world . I like these nickel on my tele ... they give them that extra twang .
5 #### Bought the Canon Speedlite 220EX for my Canon G9 . I find it to be very compatible with the camera and not nearly as bulky as the more expensive higher - end Canon flash units . The compact flash is well constructed , lightweight , and has good range . I certainly recommend the 220EX for any compatible compact cameras .
5 #### not a fan of the faux marble plastic , but the sound is pristine . find a good audiophile review of these particular headphones , if you need all of the intricacies spelled out for you . personally , i have a set of audio technica ath - m50x , sennheiser hd 280 pro , and vmoda crossfades as well , and these blow all of them out of the water . you 'll need an amplifier to do them any justice . sure , you can hear sound out of them if you plug them into your phone or ipod or whatever , but the resistance on these headphones is significantly higher than on your standard run of the mill headphones . so , you 'll need a bit more ' oomph ' to push sound into these .
3 #### Purchased this in hopes of sealing a small leak on a condenser found in a jeep grand cherokee . It held for a couple of days . I believe the leak was too large for this or any similar product .
5 #### Great strings long life I use them on my Taylor T5
4 #### The mats are sort of thin , and do n't fit perfect in my ram 2500 . However , they are very nice and sharp looking . They will add value to your truck without a doubt . I m going to velcro them to the floor so they do n't move and then they will be perfect .
1 #### Product does not work as described . I purchased 10 cables and none of them work . I tried returning the cables and have received an email stating , " So - cool has closed the return request listed below " and the reason , " Solved a technical issue " . I spent less than $ 2 a cable and now ca n't return them . I know the saying goes , " you get what you pay for " but I did n't realize that I COULD NOT return defective merchandise !
4 #### Pretty solid stand , bought it for the sons Remo pads , works as expected
4 #### I 'm glad I got this camera . I 've been debating for a long time whether to get a digital camera . I use a variety of digital cameras at work and know how useful they are . This one had the price that I wanted to pay and the performance of $ 1000 + cameras from a couple of years ago . The colors look great . The software is a breeze to use . The quality of the camera seems to be very good so far . I would have scored this camera 5 out of 5 if it came with a case and a USB connector . It is slow to download with the serial cable . I still have n't been able to take any good photos at night : firework displays , city lights , full moon , etc . I 'm planning on purchasing a case , a 32 MB Flash Card and a USB Reader .
5 #### Good fit in my suburban , good price , good arrive in time . I Like this little covers in my suburban and easy to install .
4 #### These are very nice picks for lead playing . They take a little practice time to adjust to the feel of them . They have almost no bend and give you a very percussive sound when picking . They also helped me play faster and cleaner . These picks are easy to hold and have a nice texture . After a few weeks of pretty much nothing but sweep picking , they have n't worn down much at all . The only reason I took a star of is because they are unusable for strumming but they are n't really meant for that . Overall , these picks are my new favorites for lead guitar and another hit for dunlop .
3 #### I probably play a bit to aggressively for these . They provided the volume reduction and sound I wanted for a small room , but they fell apart on me really quickly . I suggest others take a look at products from FLIX . I have had a ton of success with those .
5 #### A good pick even if a bit smooth and harder to hang on to as some others .
5 #### It is good and as expected . I love to have it with me for my international travel . I love it .
4 #### This little , Fender Mini Electric Guitar Stand , works perfectly to hold my , Hagstrom Swede . Plenty of neoprene protection for the bottom of the guitar , in fact , with the Swede , it slightly grips the guitar so that when lifting the guitar from the stand , the stand does not let go , and is so light , it comes off the floor with the guitar . No biggie , but just an observance .
5 #### rebuilt the carb on my 289 ford engine . great price on the kit . everything was perfect.my car runs great now.thanx
5 #### For $ 10 why risk buying junk when you can have Motorcraft ? Kind of odd that the inlet and outlet are not capped to prevent foreign objects from getting lodged in the filter ... but it does come in a box .
5 #### After losing my cell phone to a lake while flyfishing i decided it was time to try and avoid that mistake . I LOVE this guy i actually bought another one of these ( a larger size ) . I can pretty much let it sit beside me in the water and it will float and not take on any water . It is the best enclosure for valuables . I took this to a theme park where i knew there would be water rides and it still protected . I also used this on the beach to protect my phone . It kept my phone out of the sandy elements . I recommend this product . Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well .
5 #### The replacement screen works great . I had no problem uninstalling and reinstalling the screen with the help of youtube . I forgot to remove the back plate from the old screen which made the new screen seem smaller so do n't forget the plate attached to the back of the screen on the original . The back plate is needed to make the screen fit securely . Since replacing the screen , the screen failed twice . ( Once from dropping the phone ) After uninstalling and reinstalling , the screen continues to work . For some reason I feel that I replaced a good working screen . One might want to uninstall and reinstall before ordering a replacement . Do n't forget to clean under the four small circular pads below the screen . I 've learned that if the screen clicks , it may still work . If the back light works and you can still see the options it may still work . Uninstalling and reinstalling is easy . Trust me .
4 #### It is a good value , but is not top notch quality . If you extend both arms in the same direction , the TV ( 30 inch ) tilts . However if the arm goes right , then left , the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great .
5 #### I have over 15 years playing experience and I would not have any other strings on my guitar . I have messed around with many different brands and even the $ 1 / pack I found online ( which I wanted to change half way through a set ) but there is simply nothing else out there at this price which lasts as long , sounds as good and makes playing such a pleasure as these . I play mostly acoustic guitar in a one man show and play anywhere from 2 - 5 hours , though the average is around 3 hours . I finger pick but mostly strum with medium thickness picks . I tune frequently to open chords and there never is a problem . I never leave home without a few packs in my case in case a string breaks , but I rarely need them until I decide to change all my strings . They last a long time and never seem to loose their vibrant sound .
3 #### I bought this after good experiences with their Ford Explorer and Toyota Camry manuals . I liked the detail and the photographs . However , I found some key information missing in this manual . First , the newer CR - Vs use a " Maintenance Minder " to assist in performing ongoing maintenance ( belts , fluids , tire rotation , etc ) . However , there is no mention of the MM in this manual . Second , changing the rear differential fluid is part of the ongoing maintenance schedule for 4WD CR - Vs . This is definitely a DIY project . However , the manual dedicates only a few overview paragraphs on this , with no photographs . There is a drain hole and a fill hole , but no mention of where they are located . The drain plugs are removed with the square end of a 3/8 " ratchet , but no mention of this . Finally , Honda recommends new crush washers ( oil changes too ) , but again , no mention of this . I did find numerous photographs and gory details on tearing down and rebuilding the engine , if that 's what you 're up to .
5 #### Purchased to clean my s&b filter because I 'm not going to pay 60 dollars from s&b when I can get this for a fraction of the cost and works great
5 #### Not too big , not too small ... just the right size for my DSLR , a rather large flash , three extra batteries and memory cards , and three lens . The bag is well designed to protect your camera against rain and bumping . The camera body with lens attached is designed to sit on the left side center with the lens running down the middle - the bag 's design is flexible enough to support short stubby lens or the longer telephoto lens . There are two accessory pouches with one up front for batteries and memory cards and the other up on the cover for anything else . I put my cables , tools , and cleaning cloth up there . The top secures with three rather large strap clips and it comes with a nice shoulder strap . There are straps on the left and right which accept accessory pouches from the Tamrac MX line . The fit and finish seems top rate and worthy of years and years worth of service .
5 #### For the longest time , I 've been looking for a pair of headphones that wo n't hurt my head or ears after wearing them for a while ... my search is over ! These headphones are easily the most comfortable sub-$50 headphones I 've ever used . Right when I got them , I took them for a test run- wearing them for two hours straight- and not the slightest bit of pain or discomfort ! They also have great sound quality , but do n't take my word for it ; I 'm not exactly an expert when it comes to " sound quality " . Also , they are very small , lightweight and portable . They fold up into a neat little circle , and come with a small pouch for easy transport . Handy ! Bottom line , these things are extremely comfortable and have great sound quality . Best quality you 're going to get in this price range !
5 #### It sound very good and it feel smooth beneath my feet , I was planning to buy an expensive one but I 've decided to keep it with me . I 'm happy with this pedal .
5 #### I really like this case for my iPhone 3 G ! It 's very easy to use , looks nice on my belt , and I think it does a great job protecting my iPhone while at the same time permitting access to important features such as the mute button , volume buttons , headphone jack , and speakers . The " Top 5 " things I like about this case are : 1 . I like the magnetic closure much more than velcro . There 's no noise when I open the case and it wo n't wear out over time like velcro has a tendency to do . ( Some people say the magnetic closures can interfere with receiving calls , but I have n't had any problems . ) 2 . It 's easy to pop my iPhone in and out of the case . And , I can remove the phone from the case without unplugging my headphones . 3 . I found the clip slides easily over my belt so I do n't have to fight with it when attaching to my belt . 4 . I like the quality and look & feel of the case . 5 . I think the price is very reasonable compared to some other cases of the same genre . All in all , I 'm an extremely satisfied customer and I 'd highly recommend this case for the iPhone 3G.
5 #### I 've used the Java reeds since they first came on the market . They 've never let me down in their quality and more importantly in their consistency . They always perform well and there is never a bad one in the box . Try 'em , you won , t be disappointed
5 #### More perfect strings . Great for a seasoned guitar and equally great for a brand new guitar . Thank you .
5 #### Great solid product . Does exactly what it needs to , and I all around just love these simplistic light weight but strong straps . Not stiff at all , very comfortable
5 #### I really appreciate this recorder , but the sound is a bit throaty compared to my Alto recorder . So I 'm guessing the more expensive Yamaha Soprano probably sounds better . If you have the money , look into it . Still , I wo n't knock this instrument . For the cost it 's amazing and when I play baroque on it I feel like I 've just been transported to a chamber in Europe . Party on .
2 #### um what can i say , really do n't have anything nice to say , not durable , kind of ugly and pops open , not so secure , i bought a few to decorate but decided not to even waste more $ when they arrived . do n't spend your $ $ on these .
4 #### I got these to replace the mirrors on my bronco , they are ok , but deff , cheaply made , and are smaller than the factory ones , I have several fords , I probably wo n't buy them again
5 #### Yep , Dr Tranny 's Instant Shudder Fix did the trick for my 2004 Grand Marquis . If you experience a feeling like you are going over rumble strips when the transmssion is changing gears , that is Shudder . I got it after a hard driving high speed weekend trip through the mountains . Nothing ever fails on these 2003 - 2011 Crown Victoria / Grand Marquis cars and I was surprised by the problem . I did some research . Do n't change the transmission fluid , do n't change the transmission filter . Just get a tube of this stuff . Cut the tip off this little tube , let the liquid flow into the transmission at the transmission filler tube under the hood and drive it around for a day to let it get through the transmission system . All the other positive reviews are right , this goo works great .
5 #### I love D'addarios in general . These strings really hold their tone for quite a while . They 're nice and responsive to the touch . Lot 's of pluck which is perfect for playing jazz . I never break strings and find these have a beautiful , warm tone .
5 #### I am very happy with the cable . No issues at all . While some people brag about their high dollar cables , actual testing just does n't seem to support the need for it . Most people 's ears just are n't that good . IMHO
3 #### First , the comfort issue . The headset has its earpiece fixed in relation to the headband , so you ca n't swivel the earpiece to fit the contour of your head . For me , that makes it press harder on the rear part of my ear than on the front , and it makes the entire headset feel like it wants to slide off . I am going to try a fix to this by holding the metal headband in two pairs of pliers and applying a twist to it to give it the angle I need . More importantly , the sound is n't all that good . The maximum volume is kind of low , but still well within a hearable volume . But the things seems to be prone to interference , since I hear broken talk on all calls , no matter where I am . If I hold my cell phone right next to the headset , the interference goes away , so I am sure it is a Bluetooth problem . I tested a couple other Bluetooth headsets I have and none of them have the problem . I wanted an over - the - head style for a specific purpose so none of those other ones fill the need . So I will just put up with the problem - I can deal with it .
5 #### Be cautious if you have suspension mounted toms . You can make it work if you flip them upside down ........ it is n't a huge deal . I did notice I am missing the angle of having it the correct way as the mic is a little higher but , like I said , not a huge deal . On a typical kit , these rock , buy buy buy ! ! !
4 #### I 've had one of these for the better part of 10 years for my car , and just recently ordered an additional Absorber to use strictly while training our new puppy . It works well for cleaning up general household messes , including the occasional accident on the carpet , without having to go through a ton of regular towels that would then need to be completely laundered and dried . This saves me a lot of time during the inevitably difficult puppy training .
5 #### Love these little guys . Can put them about anywhere and they hold more than just coffee . Use them in bathroom for spray , beside for water .... many uses .
5 #### 1st class product ! Works perfectly .... good quality too . Get one for yourself ! !
5 #### I purchased the product along with the binding machine . This is an excellent product for the price ; exactly the right size I needed , and very durable .
3 #### Cases have to be removed in order to use this base . I would have returned it , but the returning seemed more of a hassle than the cost paid originally . It 's just not very useful ... if you have a case .
5 #### great product recommend to anyone who wants to save money and get a little more out of your gas tank , have been purchasing K&N filter for about 15yrs know and believe me its worth every penny .
5 #### I 've been looking for a lighter alternative to my absolutely perfect Sony MDR-7506 for years . Something with comparable sound quality , but lighter and less bulky for street / train listening and travelling . In this quest , I bought ( and resold ) several promising candidates : Sennheiser HD-25 ( too punchy basses were tiring ) , Sony MDR-10RC ( muddy basses ) , Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 on - ear ( too much bass and too bulky on the ears ) , as well as many other headphones I tried in stores . These Koss Porta Pro are amazing : superb sound ( more bass than the 7506 , though , if you are into flat response ) , extremely light , not leaking in or out as much as people say ( totally OK for outdoor and public transportation listening ) , easy to adjust pressure on the head , very compact when folded and put in the pouch coming with them ( see picture ) , I also like the jack angle which is halfway between 90 and straight . Certainly not the most comfortable headphones out there , because of the unpadded headband that tends to press on the sides of the head and a metal hook you can feel on your right ear if you wear the headband too much to the back like I like to ( see photo ) . Altogether , fantastic cups , no compromise on sound quality compared to my 7506 and a very light and compact option for outdoor listening and travel .
1 #### Nice looking but the inside has no real value . No pictures or layout as to how to use the bag or how it was intended to be used . A waste of money since all the items necessary to use the box for travel wil not fit .
5 #### Well priced , aesthetically was exactly what I wanted with my black and white contemporary set up . Good quality too
4 #### This is an excellent product for engine flush . My oil was yellow but after 500 miles it turned the oil to black . Sea Foam broke down the oil . The engine knocked like hell , and loud . I changed my oil and the engine stopped knocking . Sea Foam reduced the rough idle about 5 % . Other reviews suggested leaving the Sea Foam in the engine between 10 to 20 minutes , or 50 miles are more practical .
5 #### This is a little smaller than the lug wrench I keep in the garage , but its slightly smaller size makes it great for keeping in the trunk with your emergency tools . After almost ruining an expensive lug nut on a premium alloy wheel trying to loosen it with the crummy lug wrench that came with the car , I ordered a couple of these and put one in the trunk of each car so they would always be there . This wrench provides far better leverage than the factory supplied wrench , but not as much as my bigger 4 - way wrench . A hint : wrap some plastic electrical tape around whichever arm fits your lug nuts . Then you do n't have to keep checking to make sure you 've got the right socket . The wrench is marked in both metric and US sizes , which are so close to each other that you do n't need to worry about which kind to buy .
3 #### It may work for KC lights but will not fit around my 6 " non KC fog light as this lens cover fits a 7 " diameter lens .
4 #### These are good value but other 's have mentioned make sure you actually need this many because if you let them sit around too long they will degrade . I change out about once a week so this is ideal for me . The reason I 've given it 4/5 stars is because the wound strings sometimes will not come out as the friction between them is too great , and I have had to use pliers to drag them out . Frustrating , but not a deal breaker .
5 #### Have just ordered my 3rd set . Seems like they only last for a couple of years B 4 they no longer work & need 2 B replaced
5 #### great buy at the time , but since , I have had no use for it .
5 #### Use this product to stabilize the fuel for all my power equipment including chain saws , tractor mowers , generators and log splitter . Add Sea Foam to the auto and truck engines regularly to prevent carbon buildup .
5 #### I love this little thing , It 's works great when I 'm on the road .
5 #### Great picks - I 've always used Dunlop for my acoustic guitars - They rarely ever break , and they help to not break strings as easily
4 #### I had the opportunity to take the iTorch with me this past week Camping . Its a very nice product , easy to hang on too and small enough to fit in a pocket with ease . The LED flashlight is a handy feature . It 's not overly bright but it worked well in a pinch in a tent . I managed to get about 2 charges out of the iTorch for my phone . I used it during some of the charging time so , I might have been able to get more out of it had the phone been off . This would be quite handy for a photographer who uses their phone as a Geotagging device when taking pictures . I have been to Maine in Acadia State Park a few times and turned Geotagging on my phone . It certainly eats through battery . My only problem with the device is that between charging , turning the LED or Laser on or off . It can get a little difficult . It was pretty easy to shut the battery pack off when turning on or off the LED and a few times the LED came on when I just wanted the battery pack on . It could be because of my lack of time with the device , but a separate button to turn on the LED or Laser would make this a 5 star device .
4 #### I use several of these on a daily basis in my auto repair shop . Mostly they work perfectly . Occasionally I 'll get one that only lasts a year before it starts to fail , but usually they last about 4 years with daily use and abuse . For the money I do n't think there 's a better product .
1 #### I 'm with Maulleigh " Maulleigh " ( New York , NY ) , these things do n't fit ( try bending your head down while wearing them and they slip off ) . Worthless .
5 #### I like the sound on my Schecter guitar . Deeper sound which I like and warmer tone . I 'll buy them again .
5 #### honestly , a lot of people question amazon products , but they really are n't bad ! I use their cable for my iPhone 5S and their cable for hooking my computer up to my tv . It 's even more durable than the apple one I got at the store .
5 #### So far Elixirs are my go to strings , they last long and are easy on the fingers .
5 #### I like it ! So far it has done a fine job of protecting my new Garmin eTrex from wear and tear .
5 #### I have been a FingerEase fan for 15 plus years . I hate to forget it or run out , keeps the neck nice and fast even on guitars with glossy necks ( Les Pauls , PRS ) . String noise is reduced but the main benefit is the ease of playing you get when the strings are slick . String noise is reduced but the main benefit of FingerEase is keeping them clean and fast . Worlds better than Fast Fret , try Fast Fret instead ...
5 #### This is my third GPS purchase and by far the best value of them all . It quickly acquires satellites and does the navigation work consistently . I like the compact packaging and the way it mounts on the windshield . It also is smart enough to tell when it is night time and reverses the display colors so the light does n't overwhelm you .
5 #### I 've been using these picks for 10 + years , they 've always been great . Between these blues and the yellow , I 'm covered .
5 #### There is a reason Taylor uses these on their guitars , have them on all my acoustics ; they sound and feel awesome .
4 #### I got the Samsung Fascinate and started looking around for all the little goodies to complement my new device . I put a clear skin on it ( Xtreme Guard ) and got this compact Clingo holder . It worked perfectly . Then I ordered a more substantial case that was described as hard plastic with a rubberized finish . Rubberized means silicon and Clingo does n't like silicon . It does n't grip silicon . It 's not in the product description on the Amazon page but if you go to the Clingo website , there 's the disclaimer under FAQs : " Some cases that are extremely textured , leather or silicone - based will not work at an optimal level . " I love this little product and Clingo is an amazing substance . Just be aware of the surface on your phone before you buy this and find out that " will not work at an optimal level " means " no go . "
5 #### This is the real deal . No bells and whistles . You can get a cool " wah " out of it or just move it to a certain position to get a great effect ( there 's a name for that , I just ca n't remember it ) . Also lots of fun just to screw around with and drive your wife crazy . Built like a brick .... house . Highly recommended .
5 #### This works great for completely reflecting any and everything that 's put in front of it . But while in the sun its hard to see your screen , very hard . If you do n't mind that one problem I recommend it especially to women because it acts as a mirror very well ( two in one )
5 #### This is by far the best Bluetooth speakerphone I 've tried . People tell me they ca n't tell I am in the car . Even at highway speeds , it does n't pick up any background noise at all . I have this mounted to the visor of my SUV . The only problem is because the roofline is high , I was told I sounded soft . I flipped the visor down about 3 inches ( it does n't obstruct my view at this height ) and the sound is now fantastic I 'm told . I 've tried many speakerphones and this one is the best by far . It has a mechanical slide on / off switch so you can leave it off and flip it on instantly when the phone rings . No delay or missed calls while holding down an on / off button . It also has a mute button and volume up and down buttons . It gets sufficiently loud and sounds good and clear . I 'd recommend this over any speakerphone at any price . Best of all it was under fifty bucks at Amazon !
5 #### Good product to hide more than a wire or two . The adhesive could be a bit better
5 #### Extremely hapy with these . I was looking to replace the pricy Koss PortaPros , had tried the Koss KSC75 Portables but found them awkward and too fragile , as well as Kosss The Plug , which yeskeep falling out of the ear . The SportPros are actually a mini - version PortaPros , same over - the head construction , fold - in ear pieces , leather case , and plug adapter for half the price with the same great sound . Not to take anything away from the PortaPros , but I can have two sets of these for the same price . They stay on your head , they stay on your ear , so you do n't have to worry about them falling out like the plugs or have to wrestle with the over - the - ear hooks of the KSC75 Portables . Just an - all - around better headphonenuf said .
1 #### Cheap plastic junk , tried to install it and it tore . I am surprised Amazon would carry this
1 #### Sorry amazon , this is my first dissapointed review at amazon . there are 2 d&g as anne said , black and gold which is the limited edition one and the mass production one , i just bought this one but unfortunately its not in a perfect or new condition some dirt on it , the color is faded and is almost gone from the side buttons , does nt close welland a white label inside the body trying to cover the original fone information , the assemblying is very poor , i love motorola , never had this problem , please be aware of thi , i think it 's refabrished or something , missing features , buttom line DONT BUY IT FROM HERE i would sell mine for 10 $ without shipping however i just got today.:S
5 #### Excellent case , my ephiphone fits very well , it 's very protected
5 #### Got this for my wife , she has the note 3 . The case fits nicely allowing you to easily get to all the ports and buttons . 5 outta 5 on this one , AND ITS CHEAP ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Does what it needs too . Use it for my printer , mostly for scanning documents as I 'm sitting at my desk .
5 #### Perfect case for my Plantronics Voyager Legend headset . Very happy with this product and how it has held up .
4 #### I bought this item because I was looking for a basic headset for my iPhone 4s , it 's very light , comfortable and it has very good sound , it works great with my iPhone and SIRI .
5 #### worth buying , this is exactly what it 's being described here . Go ahead and do n't think it twice because that would be wasting time lol Good seller too !
5 #### Not too much to say about this tool . It help you remove , and re - install the wheel covers with relative ease . It does the job .
4 #### My " go to " picks for acoustic strumming . I gave these picks a 4 - star because I 'm just picky with my picks ( lol ) I noticed that some batches are thicker and more stiff than others ( which I prefer ) . The tolerance range on these picks is pretty large so sometimes the picks can be a lot thinner than you might want them to be .
5 #### Need some cheap decent sounding headphones , these are them . Similar headphones cost 2x as much at local big box store , but do n't sound or fit any better . I got a pair for my wife and one for my kid , both like them .
2 #### It says 01 - 03 but it should really say 00 - 02 because in 2003 they changed the plug setup to three instead of two . So this will not fit 2003 mustangs with the mach sound system . BUYER BEWARE . It was good quality but just the wrong part for my application and the misrepresentation in the title .
5 #### I have 6 of these and I will buy more I 'm sure .
5 #### Used this radio wiring harness in my 2002 F350 Crew Cab Dually . Nice quality harness , labeled for easy installation . I had no issues .
5 #### I bought these for my brother - in - law for his birthday and he immediately fell in love with them . He has an iPod touch and I wanted to get him something bluetooth for it and this was the best thing I could find . What I did n't realize is that it would work with his cellphone at the same time . He synched it with both of them and if he get 's a call while listening to his iTouch , he just presses the answer button and it immediately switches to the phone . As with everything though , the experience ca n't be flawless . First , amazon shows that this one is the blue accent model when in fact it is n't , it 's is just straight black . This is n't a big deal though I did intend on getting blue . Second , the song controls do n't all work with the iTouch . This is n't the fault of the headset however or I would have rated it 4 stars . This is due to Apple not fully implementing the bluetooh spec yet . I assume they will at some point in one of there updates and it will they will start working . In summary , these are very much worth the price and I would buy them again and again .
5 #### These picks are nice and thin , just what I was looking for in a pick . They seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down . I 'm satisfied with these picks .
5 #### There comes a point in time when our home alarm system needs a new battery .... and the Zeus 12V 5AH rechargeable battery was just the right replacement . What I loved about this battery is that I could recharge it with a basic 12V battery recharger thus giving the battery a longer usable life . So based on a high number of satisfied views I decided this was the battery to buy ... 100 % satisfied :)
3 #### Clears the mechanical gunk that accumulates on the drive wheels ... Keeps the Unit from eating tapes . Need a separate cleaner for the Heads ....
4 #### And that 's allow multiple devices to share Verizon 's 3 G broadband . I have iPhone 3GS , iPhone 4 , iPad , and a laptop that uses this card at once on a family trip with no problems . The speed is only as good as Verizon 's signal , and can be degraded by Wi - Fi signal ( and number of devices using the network ) . Battery life seems to meet expectation . I did n't measure precisely but getting 2 - 4 hours on heavy use , and even up to a day if its pretty much idle .
1 #### Terrible packaging . It leaked because the box was to big and nothing to take up the space .
5 #### works perfect to get the factory harness to the aftermarket radio .
5 #### Did not solve my guitar pedal buzz , but it 's still a nice surge protector with I guess some emi / rfi filtering as well . Power to the People !
2 #### Not happy with the sellers description or the product . The description says " Heavy Duty " which makes you assume that it 's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip , but it 's not . IT 'S RUBBER ! ! ! It sucks . Used it a couple times and it 's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it 's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly , and flex . IT 'S FLEXIBLE ! ! ! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips ? ! ! ! Make sure you do n't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead .
3 #### The set was delivered in very reasonable time , item as pictured . Will not work with Toyota vehicles or many other foreign makes . A bit more information as to actual vehicle usage in the item description would have been very helpful . Tool looks well made and should function well with most American , especially older vehicles .
4 #### Inexpensive ( I am not an audiophile and do n't need anything fancy ) . Comfortable ( my main requirement ) . Sound through the ear pieces is suitable for my uses .
5 #### The BBE 882i , is simply amazing . It has done more for my setup than anything else I have purchased thus far . I use it with both a Korg Triton Studio 88 key keyboard and a Nuemann tlm 103 . The BBE 882i is the second thing in my signal chain ( right after my preamp ) and the effect on my sound is no less than profound . When used with a Korg Triton Studio keyboard the clarity produced is absolutely stunning ( not to say it was bad before , when I bought it new about 4 years back , it was $ 6,000 us and to this day is still one of the best keyboards on the market ) but the BBE 882i makes it sound so much better . When the used with the Neumann 103 , once again the clarity produced is amazing ( I like the sound it produces better than a u87 ) . I have also used it with much cheaper mics such as the Studio Projects C1 and an Audio Technica 2020 with great results . I would suggest this to anyone who owns a recording studio or has a home studio . One word of advice I would suggest setting all the levels on the 882i to level 6 ( this seems to give the best results with large diaphragm condenser microphones and keyboards ) .
5 #### Use it for all my runs and outdoor things . Fits my incredible 2 perfectly . I have even ran in the rain and snow and it protected the phone from the elements
4 #### I added this pedal to my board a couple of months after I got sick of the MXR Bezerker OD 's noise . I placed the gate after the OD but before my chorus and phaser . I run the trigger all the way off and have had no issues since . I tried the MXR Noise Clamp and quickly returned it . That thing sucked the ever loving life out of my tone ! This pedal does color it just a hair ( like a peach - fuzz hair ) , but not enough to take it off the board .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend . She loves it as it 's very compact and fits in her handbag quite unobtrusively , while keeping her iPhone charged at all times .
5 #### High quality , excellent appearance . Works very well with my Samsung Rugby phone . But man that clip is a monster ! If you use it at the airport , you will have to unbelt and slide it off the end ; there is no way human hands can unclip it . Very secure !
4 #### Works as expected for a practice pad . When practicing on the logo it does wear and fleck the practice pad head . Does not affect the quality of the rebound on this good practice pad .
5 #### These are hands down the best strings I got the 3 pack and it got here yesterday a few days early
4 #### Good product . I like the top of this product but the rest needs a redesign for smartphones . The headphones are well constructed , comfortable , sturdy , light and the sound range although is wide enough albeit not always sensitive . There 's no volume control or one click button . The plug is angled and not slim , I had to burn a hole in my case for it to fit . Otherwise good value for the money .
5 #### Some days it is better to just buy a good cable like this instead of putting your own ends on a bulk cable . Very reasonably priced and a quality product .
5 #### Fit the les paul perfectly . Storage space inside for accessories .
5 #### I purchased these because my Rokit Powered 8 G2s sounded a little inconsistent , especially the bass frequencies . Partly this is because of my 12x15 untreated room , partly because the monitors were sitting on my oak desk below ear level , and partly because they were transferring vibrations to the desk . The monitors now sound a little clearer , or more focused as others have said . I 'm not sure how much of this is due to the fact that the cabinets are now isolated from the desk and how much has to do with the fact that they 're now angled up toward my ears . In either case , it is not a huge night - and - day difference , but a subtle , worthwhile improvement that just makes it a lot easier to work through my mixes and hear what 's going on with each of the tracks . Definitely a worthwhile purchase .
5 #### I needed a 7 - pin midi cable for playing gigs and decided against the more expensive rocktron cable and I 'm glad I saved the money . This cable is long enough for just about any stage and so far performs just as good as any other high quality cable I 've ever used . Do yourself a favor .. if you 're in need of a 7 - pin cable save yourself some money and stop thinking about it and just order this one !
5 #### I bought the prep spray along with the vinyl marine paint to resurface my seats on my boat and I am extremely pleased . Follow the directions for prepping with this spray and then apply the vinyl paint and you will get coverage that looks like new and it has so far lasted a year with great results . I has significant mold and other stains on my seats and I restored them to like new condition . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has stained or weathered vinyl seats on their boat .
4 #### Works well . Just wish they offered pedal with metal casing .
5 #### My grandson loves these and they are very comfortable for him .
5 #### Great USB cable , durable made very well . I use this cable to add a extra USB port on my desk so I do n't have to bend over and plug in flash sticks or other USB devices .
5 #### I 'm no expert on this , but I was able to send SysEx ( system Exclusive ) data to and from a synth ( Prophet 08 ) with this interface . Some less costly interfaces only sent the data one way . Buying this first would , of course , been less expensive . There are usb to midi interfaces that are more expensive , usually a module or ' box . ' This is likely one of the lowest cost reliable and effective solutions out there .
5 #### All it said it would be . Nice to have more room on my phone !
4 #### Easy to use and very durable . A little wide as you go up the neck .
2 #### I used this product a few times on one of my headlights that was starting to oxidize and it covered up the problem , but within a few washes and a few more applications , it actually made the oxidation worse . Maybe I used it incorrectly , I 'm not really sure , but I have n't used it since . That headlight was eventually restored by a professional and then replaced as it got damaged in an accident . I do like Meguiars products , just not this one . My other headlight is starting to look a little shabby and I decided to use Ultimate Compound by Meguiars and it has done a much better job . I also used it on my girlfriend 's and dad 's headlights and the Ultimate Compound really cleared away the oxidation . I then followed that with some carnauba wax , very nice .
1 #### The telephone would not recognize the sim card . I would like my money back .
3 #### Not bad but if you plan to buy just one additional lens this bag is n't for you . Camera alone it 's fine but if you need space for more you should look elsewhere .
4 #### It really works great , for bulb photography is just what you need , but I would like a long cable , maybe 5 feet .
4 #### I love that this product is so sturdy and well built . Price is not much different than outside - hence the 4 star instead of 5 .
5 #### I ordered Poly & Nano 's at the same time for different guitars . This is my first experience with Elixir 's and both the Polywebs and Nanowebs are absolutely awesome . They play extremely smooth and they are so bright I thought I had a new guitars instead of just new strings . Poly or Nano , toss a coin as they are both the best strings I have ever played . Nano 's went on my Taylor 314CE and Poly 's went on an Epiphone AJ-100CE that had a cheap piezo pickup which I replaced with Martin T4 electronics ( which I got off Amazon ) . The AJ ( also from Amazon ) sounded pretty good for a cheap guitar except amplified their piezo sounded rather tinny . The T4 electronics fixed that along with a TUSQ saddle . After getting the action down to 3/64 the AJ-100 plays and sounds nearly as well as my Taylor & the Poly 's really brought out the sound . My Taylor sounds awesome & almost plays itself and now use it only when recording - so I do n't wear down the frets . The AJ-100 with all it 's mods , sounds & plays like my Taylor .
5 #### Its been said that at least some automobile filters should not be used on motorcycles . I am not in a position to argue that either way , but it did bother me that my dealer charges $ 12 for a filter that physically appears no different than the ones that cost $ 5 in any auto parts store . These Frams seem like a good compromise . They are made in Canada , and appear nicely finished . And they are specifically rated for motorcycle use , so despite having used auto filters in the past , this eliminates one little nagging concern as to whether I was causing long - term problems . And the price was close enough to the auto filters that I did n't feel ripped off . Delivery was also better than promised .
4 #### The case fits the iPhone 4s perfectly . Unlike some of the other reviewers , the aux input hole is big enough for standard cables . The black case on the black iPhone is great looking . 01 - 28 - 2012 Update My wife bought a " coral " color case for her white iPhone 4s . This case did not fit as perfectly as the black case on black 4s did . The vibrate switch was located off center in the cutout and is a little hard to move up and down . Also the opening for the headphone seems a little smaller or off so the connection is tighter with through the case . For this reason , I dropped the overall rating one star . In spite of the above , my wife wanted to keep the case and , in fact , bought another coral case for a niece .
2 #### Bought for son . Wanted a new pair of binoculars for myself . Used son 's . Saved money for Vortex .
5 #### I love Fender picks . The celluloid plastic never fades and even after rough n ' tough wear , they are long lasting and great for all types of music .
5 #### A must buy ! Buy it now ! ! Your guitar will love you ! A must buy ! Buy it now ! ! Your guitar will love you !
5 #### Exactly what I needed for my for my new 4 K TV . I recently purchased a 4 K TV and was having it installed so wanted to be ready with new cables . Of course Best Buy recommended some gold tipped ( same here ) cables at just $ 39.99 each to go with my new TV . I needed one for the TV and one for the Blu Ray so together and with tax that would have tacked on almost $ 100 to the purchase , I passed . Here I picked up two for about $ 10 . I suppose there may be a difference in " shielding " if you are running these around your subwoofer or any large magnet . But they are very solid and generally the idea is we do n't need the mess and tangle of wires any longer just one between the TV and cable box and another to the Blu Ray . These do the job . They may be called " basics " and that is exactly what they are , they just do the job , which is all I need .
5 #### Very Good quality , I use it as my snare head . It takes the abuse and sounds excellent ! I have been using REMO for decades now , and although I am certainly not disappointed , I have been considering experimenting with other brands , just to see if there 's that much of a difference . Still , you wo n't go wrong with this drum head , although I only like how coated heads sound on snare drums . Personal preference I suppose .
2 #### I had the original ABSORBER ( several in fact over the years ) . My most recent finally wore out . The orignal versions performed very well . BUT the " NEW " version .... NOT ! ! ! ! I am amazed at the good reviews received on the very poor " new " Absorber being sold now . It performs no were near as good as the original . What a big step down in quality . Hard , Barely absorbant , Discolors easy , Tears easy ...... look elsewhere ...... I am not sure where ? ? ? , but someone has to make a decent synthetic drying cloth ( by the way , a real chamois is very hard to care for and thus my search for a good synthetic ) ... sorry for being wordy .
4 #### I bought the Plantronics Voyager 520 on holiday on - line special for $ 27 to replace a Motorola H700C. My friends tell me the audio quality on their end is much improved , and I find it MUCH easier to hear on my end while driving in the car in all conditions . It is reasonably comfortable , although the rubber earpiece on the Plantronics sometimes hurts my ear if worn for longer periods of time , particularly when a hat is worn over it . I found the Plantronics volume control far superior and easier to use in practice than the Motorola 's , and , like others who have left reviews here , I occasionally found myself turning down the volume due to excellent audio quality of the earpiece . The battery life has been excellent so far , and it I have yet to need the in - car battery charger . I bought an i - Tip for my i - Go for $ 9.99 , so chargers for my phone devices are inexpensive . My smaller Motorla did not last nearly this long without recharging , usually quitting after one or two long calls . All - in - all , I recommend this highly as a bluetooth device that offers excellent quality and functionality for the money .
5 #### Ultex picks sound a bit jangly on my Martin dread so I use something else , but these babies really brought my Gibson jumbo to life like nothing else did . I had tried everything to coax an exciting sound out of that big old box , but these picks finally did it . They were a total revelation : bright , crisp , clean , upfront sound . Easy to hold , fast and slick , they feel good against the strings and boy , do they sing . I use the 73 's for flatpicking or digging into blues , and the 60 's are great for smoother rhythm playing . Sometimes in a pinch I 'll even use a 1.0 on the mandolin , although it 's not my first pick , so to speak . Contrary to other reviews citing indestructibility , I have found they do create dust from being shaved against the strings , which is a little strange and a just a tad messy , but it 's more than worth it for the sound . My only gripe at this writing : how come the 60 's run a buck - fifty more per six pack than the 73 's do ? Oh , the injustice .
5 #### I have owned other BT headsets , but this one is my favorite . It stays on your ear , and the sound is great . The fit took some adjusting , and I have decided to remove all but the cone - shaped earpiece . The foam pads made the earpiece too large , and a bit painful . Without it , the headset is great . It is a bit heavy at first , but after a few minutes , you will forget that you have it on .
4 #### i love the tone and playability of these strings . and i love that amazon has them so affordable . my only dislike is that the strings tarnish way too fast . but i will keep buying them and replacing them as i need . thanks .
4 #### I was worried that the cord would not stretch long enough to reach my detector but once I took it out of the box I stretched it across my chest and my span is over 6 ' , so its plenty long enough . I fired up the detector with it and all was well . Now I m safer from radar guns .
5 #### It 's a very good engine cleaner put it in the gas or diesel and cleans out your carburetor injectors or whatever else it works excellent as good as stated on the pot it
4 #### It is working so far . Just plug it in and you are good to go . Being used for internet on a Cat5 wired network ( 4 wires ) in the house . One of three switches which all seem to compatible . Running telephone on the other 4 wires . That seems to work too . Picked up a lot of bandwidth by not using the switch in the DSL modem .
4 #### The holster is nice but would not work with Samsung Convoy with a rubberized Case cause The elastic side stretches and is to smug a fit to slide the phone or In .. Returning for refund .
5 #### Wow . Put these on an old FORD F-350 4x4 with a 460 V-8 . I can pull a 36 foot toy hauler while keeping the front wheels on the ground . These AIR LIFT bags work well and were easy to install . They have lasted a long time of daily , off - road use pulling a heavy trailer .
5 #### This gun is Heavy Duty . Like many reviews , there are 2 items you must know . First , carefully reattach body to head being careful not to cross thread . Second , Coupler should be taken apart , I used my vice and chanel locks , Works great now . If fitting gives you problem , use a dremmel to grind down slightly like others recommended . Also when loading grease , DO Not tighten head all the way until you get the air out . Read the directions . There is no seepage from plunger like cheap ones . 5 Star Unit . Happy Greasing !
5 #### Does the job ! ! No problems with product at all . Would purchase again .
1 #### Did not fit my 98 ' F-150 . Waste of money- went into the trash
5 #### If you spend any time on Bob Is The Oil Guy , you 'll know how well reviewed these are ( they cut them open and post pictures of the internals ) . Great filter , even better deal when you go the subscription route .
5 #### Second bottle . Again , absolutely recommend this product if you have gel coat , fiberglass , aluminum , or your everyday vehicle . People stop by the RV and ask how I got it looking so good . I tell them with pride . It takes a little elbow grease , but you eat an elephant one bite at a time . Do n't get in a hurry , do n't do it in the sun , and make sure it 's clean prior to beginning . All little things that will make it that much better .
1 #### For the money this product does not perform as i had hoped . Battery indicator will indicate full charge but when i plug it into my phone , it goes dead . Battery will suddenly have no bars . Also the icel does not seem to hold its charge . Update : I have n't used this that much since purchasing it over a year ago ( maybe three times at the most ) but since knowing that we had a hurricane coming , i decided to charge it up to full power using the laptop method ( since it is incapable of charging by any other means like a wall charger ) . After getting 5 full bars , i unplugged it and waited for the power to go out , which it did eventually . I plugged in the icel to my iphone and what happens ? absolutely nothing . 5 full bars went to zero in 10 seconds and did not charge the iphone . Bottom line , this is a horrendous product and is completely unreliable .
3 #### purchased from amazon third party . product description states " Gold - plated copper contacts minimize data loss " , the product ( per belkin product number ) is not " Gold - Plated " , the information on amazon is incorrect .
5 #### Quality item at a great price with super fast shipping ! Perfect for my application . I used it on my Hornblasters Shocker air horn setup .
5 #### Nice feel , nice optics , easy to use , nice packaging and the service from this seller was second to none . I will use this little binocular set forever and it just might make it ! I 'm not easy on things either .
5 #### This was the easiest part of working on my street rod to convert it from a manual choke to electric . Went it quickly and worked and I only needed to set the high idle .
5 #### I bought 2 of these for my kids phones . They love them . Fit perfect . Protects the phone from break age .
5 #### Have only had one other bluetooth headset , which was ok except it always felt like it was about to fall off . This one fits well for both me and my wife . ( bought one for me too ) Also it 's not nearly so obvious looking . Voice quality , both incoming and outgoing is great .
5 #### I use this to run a single , mono XLR shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my Tascam DR-40 , which saves me a step in post - production . The quality is fine and it does what it 's supposed to do . Good price for a good product .
4 #### I was a little mislead when it seemed to indicate automated focus . It 's regular focus , the item just has a lever to focus instead of a wheel . They are a little bulky so I only pull out when I am trying to spot whales out on the ocean .
5 #### These headphones are awesome , especially if pressure on your head can give you headaches . Wear a hat , do n't wear one , does n't matter , with a little tinkering , these headphones are comfortable . And the sound is good as well .
5 #### Great for elementary age starter class ! We ordered a different color for each child to avoid , " Which one 's mine ? " The kids love practicing .... outside !
5 #### Shipping a little expensive .... small funnel that comes in useful when filling gas tanks with small openings . Also for hard to get to vehicle gas tanks and or oil reservoirs .
4 #### The only thing I would change is the screen opening- it comes right to the edge so typing takes a lot of getting used to . Other than that I love it .
5 #### Does the job well . Saves having to clean the Connector when needing to use Trailer .
5 #### and I bought one for my dad also . The thing I like about it is it pulls in the AM stations very well . I listen to a lot of talk radio in the office and the other * cheap * boom box type radios can not cut through the computer generated RF but this one discriminates and I can hear the stations . Also , the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes . It is also very inexpensive . I would recommend to anyone .
3 #### This did n't work well enough in my rural fringe area so I returned it for a better model . This model does not cover the 4 G LTE data band . It is a discontinued model .
5 #### This cable was actually a Daddairo cable instead of Planet Waves but it is a good deal . I use it between my amp and tuner . I like it .
5 #### I do n't have experience with a lot of different strings , but I use these on my LP - style electric guitar and I like them a lot .
1 #### I received mine 3 days ago ... and quite frankly , I wish I had saved my $ 2 . The thing was way too big . My phone slid around inside of it . It if were smaller , it would be perfect . But as it is ... junk .
1 #### Product description says ' chrome ' which implies metal . It is plastic . They should change their description ; it is misleading . I had this for a couple of months before it broke .
5 #### Great neutral sound , very good clarity and one of the best headphones for the price
4 #### I tried these in the course of testing different strings for their sound , durability , etc . , for my electric guitars . Pro Comfortable , as much as pressing your fingers against metal can be Bright sound Bullet end helps ease of removal from a strat - type trem block . Con Did n't last as long as I 'd have liked , from a brightness perspective . Seemed to get " stale " more quickly than I wanted .
4 #### Good stick . Kind of light and thin for me . I prefer the 5A extreme . The weight of these sticks is n't great for rudiments , as they lack bounce for diddles and such , but their lightness make them good for speed , which is what Cope is all about .
5 #### Best Iphone holder ever ! Bought two in January 2012 , still using to this day flawlessly . Love how easy to snap in and out . Used for Iphone 4s , 5 , 5s .
4 #### I 'll forgo all the techie specifications ( if you have n't already read them by the time you got to this review , chances are that you do n't care about those details anyway ... like me ) , so let me just say that this is a very , very comfortable and stable headset . I do n't find myself checking it or worrying about it falling out of my ear when not in use or other such nonsense . Beyond that , the sound quality is excellent and I have yet to have someone on the other end of the line comment about " what kind of echo chamber are you in ? " or " gee , that other conversation ( at the next bench ) sounds more interesting than ours . " It 's easy to use , it paired up with my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Samsung - Blackjack - i607 / dp / B002RS4GAI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Samsung Blackjack i607 < /a>&nbsp;quickly and painlessly . That 's important to me , as some newer pieces do n't play as nicely with two year old technology as we might think . And I 've yet to have any issues with battery life or operating distance . I recommend it !
4 #### Just came in . Looks good will post more after install . Quick shipping .
2 #### I spent time reading reviews on several different headphones in the sub $ 30 range and took a chance on these . Sound is decent , and they are fairly light but that 's about the only praise I have . The cord is waaaaay too short . To use on a treadmill you have to hold your music player or use an arm pouch . Given the lack of a volume control in the cord , unless all your music sources ( mp3s , internet radio , youtube ) are all of equal volume then you will have to adjust the volume on your music player frequently . The metal band is very stiff and too small , feels like it was sized for a child - I do n't have a large head . They 're quite uncomfortable when worn behind the neck and feel like the old " nightgear " that plagued those wearing braces in days of yore . They are tolerable for a 10 minute warmup or a 30 min cardio stint but become very uncomfortable for a longer use than that . The speakers are cheap and though they rotate , they regularly pop off the hinges and have to be snapped back together . I 've given them a few weeks and I ca n't stand them any longer . My visit back to Amazon today is to write this review and look for a replacement .
5 #### High quality clay bar , they are all the same really no need for brand loyalty as long as it 's a real brand
5 #### The medium and this low strength stuff do a great job of keeping machine screws and bolts from working loose [ and lost ] but can still allow you to break the joint when necessary . The high strength " red " is for putting it together for good
5 #### I have been using these strings since the mid 1990 's . Once you use them , you will never look at another . They do n't corrode as quickly as others and allow for smooth playing with the strings coated . I endorse few things . This is one of them .
5 #### Used this on my 2001 Miata which has no usable cupholders . I was able to use an existing screw for the center console and drilled a hole in the cup holder to get it in the right position . Some Velcro tape at the bottom secures it to the carpeting and it 's sturdy enough for me .
5 #### If you are looking for a great sounding , high quality cable , look no further ! This cable eliminated all of the interference I was getting in my home studio as well as noticiably reducing the noise in my setup without changing my tone . Well worth the price !
1 #### The product arrived and I read the instructions and charged the battery for the recommended time . Product did not work , It had no charge . I charged it again , and then same issue . I was only offered a refund and not a replacement . The product in my book is suspect . Be advised that you may have to go through multiple purchases and shippings in order to receive a functional device .
3 #### It 's a good quality product , though I 'm not a huge fan of the tinny sound of it , but this may be exactly what you 're looking for , it 's just not my preference .
5 #### Vinyl on a center console fishing boat only looks good when you store the boat indoors or cover it for winter . UNTIL NOW . This product cut deep on several months worth of black grime the white vinyl collected over the long winter storage ( outdoor & uncovered storage ) . So thankful this product works so well . I ordered a second one because there was so much vinyl to cover . Worth every penny .
5 #### Works as advertised , no issues , mounts up to 4 " pipe no problem and looks great under the hood . Using on my modded 87 Buick GN with a S cover 60 series turbo
5 #### Good quality for the money . Will last many years . Arrived packaged well and in good shape .
5 #### The best filter . Lasts a long time . Use when using synthetic oil .
4 #### I like this product a lot and it really work well . I recommend this to anybody . I tell all my friends about this I even order it twice cause a friend needed it badly so I guess everybody better order this now okay .
1 #### The manual [ ... ] on page 9 states in RED When the ipod plays music it will automatically switch to Flight mode and you can not receive calls . When you are done playing music you mus MANUALLY swithc it back . I.E. if you play music on an iphone in this speaker system you can not receive calls again until you go into your settings and disable flight mode . MAJOR DESIGN FLAW
5 #### I take pride in my car . If I do n't dry it properly , it gets all water spotted . I 've used all kinds of cloths , towels and chamoises for the job , and this thing is the best I 've found . Wet it , wring it out , and lay it on wet car and it dries completely without any spotting or danger of swirl marks . Even on my delicate paint job . I guarantee you will love this . Delighted with this purchase .
2 #### This phone worked for a few weeks and that 's about it . It only worked until the time I could return it had expired . I was not happy and would think twice about another purchase .
4 #### I ordered two of these cables ; one works flawlessly , but the other has a bit of a loose connection on the end going into the Wii , and I have to fiddle with it sometimes or else the red disappears from the picture . You get what you pay for , but at the end of the day they both work , even if one is a bit fiddly .
5 #### This is a low cost product which works well in the Mophie case for my iPhone . It is about $ 25 cheaper than ruining a headphone cord pulling it in and out of the Mophie . I would strongly recommend this to everyone as the way to go until someone comes out with a slim 3 cm cordless jack extension which fits in a Mophie .
3 #### The gooseneck is very stiff , which is good . It really stays in the position that you bend it to . However , the mounting suction cup is too rigid in cold weather and as a result , the suction cup wo n't stick when it is cold . This renders the unit virtually useless in cold weather .
5 #### THIS IS A MUST HAVE ! MOST DEFINITELY WORTH IT ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE IT WAS SOLD AT ! AND IT ALSO CAM EON TIME (:
5 #### Always a good product , I use it on all my cars .
5 #### Have n't had a chance to use it yet , but it looks very well made , and Belkin always seems to be at a high standard .
3 #### Everyone wants nuclear power like battery life on their portable electronics but unfortunately iphones do n't give anywhere close to that . The mophie juice pack allows you to add an external battery to make the overall battery life longer . Great huh ? We 'll maybe if the battery lasted longer . The juicepack does in it self drain fast . Maybe because the iphone thinks its plugged in and sucks more juice ? I do n't know . There are some nice things about the juice pack though It fits pretty flush and feels nice . It has a battery life indicator on it . You can tell when the battery is dead as the iphone will no longer look like its either charging or plugged in . Only way I like using this is when everything is all charged up . I do not like putting the iphone in the juice pack when I know the juice pack will not charge it up all the way before dying . This is bad for the iphones battery and will shorten its life . With this in mind , if you still want to get it . Do it . Do it .
5 #### This thing fit my 98 FourWinds Motorhome like a glove . No longer need to cover windows while parked to keep anyone from seeing in and it keeps sun off of interior of motorhome . Easy to put on and take off when needed . Heavy duty and should last a good long while .
5 #### This is my 2nd one of these . I had the first one nearly 10 years and it was still going strong . The only reason I bought a new one was because the surface was all worn away from where my hand sits as I use it a lot and it was looking a bit grungy . I have arthritis in my hands , especially my thumbs and this is the only device I have found that does n't hurt my hands when I use it . It is shaped so that my hand rests very comfortably on it and the cursor is moved with only the tiniest movement of the thumb on the track ball and I can scroll with just the lightest touch of my finger on the wheel . I love the fact that it is wireless and there are no wires getting in my way . After using this you will never want to go back to using a regular mouse again .
4 #### quality appears to be very good . Glass lens which is what i expected . The housing is a bit bigger than the stock light housing . I installed this lens on my 1992 Dodge B250 van . I had to cut the existing lamp holders ; which was easy to do with tin snips . With a slight modification , this worked perfect . I added some HID h4 lamps and now i can see at night . :) Thanks
5 #### My Adesso Scanner came with a velvet drawstring bag . I wanted something more substantial , and thought this case might work . The quoted dimensions are slightly off . The outside dimensions are actually 11.5 X 2.5 X 2.2 none is 3.2 The inner dimensions are 11 X 2 X 2 My Adesso Scanner is 10.75L X 1.8W X 1.25H so it fits perfectly . The case opens up into 2 hinged halves . Each half is about 1 inch deep . Each half has a 1 inch wide elastic band across the middle , and there is a sewn - in flap that protects one half from the other when closed . The scanner cable fits in the opposite half from the scanner and there is still room for some small accessories . All - in - all , I am VERY happy with this case . ,It suits my needs perfectly/
2 #### This is the 5th BlueTooth headset I have tried and despite the glowing reviews , it is no better than any other I have . I had real hopes for it but it falls short for me in two ways . First , the fit is really bad . The main issue is that the rubbber thing that goes in your ear is nearly impossable to turn and position and the ear hook is NOT bendable so you can make the actual microphone part lay flat to your cheek . Second , the quality , both send and recieve is not noticablly better than a $ 29 palm device I have .
5 #### excellent product , I am very happy and satisfied , I recommend
5 #### Easy to set up and use . One drawback is that you must turn it off by the button , if you plan to use your phone outside the car , when nearby .
4 #### This VCR cleaner was purchased at Amazon.com and as usual it was well packaged and received well within the promised time . This VHS Wet Cleaner does clean the heads of our VCRs very nicely . Easy to use and does the job .... not much more to be said ....
5 #### Brand new and sealed bottle . Have installed . Works as it should . Happy with purchase . John W.
1 #### This cleaner worked about two times , never would rewind properly - now it has completely broken my favorite VCR beyond repair ... and I know how to fix things , this ca n't be fixed ! If you buy this head cleaner then you are one brave person ! This item cost about $ 11 bucks , plus another $ 99.00 tom replace my now broken VCR ! Junk ! By the way , what happened is it got stuck - i mean really stuck good ! Removal was impossible without damaging the VCR .
5 #### So , as many Life Proof case owners , I was searching for a " dock extender " that ACTUALLY WORKS with the case . I took a chance on this one and IT WORKS . I love the fact that I can just carry this adapter in my laptop case and use my Micro USB cable from my Plantronics BackBeat 903 's to charge my iPhone too . Just pop this adapter into the Iphone and plug the micro USB on the side and WALA ! ! ! ! I have also attached pics of this adapter on my iPhone with a Life Proof case to help ensure potential buyers that it IS COMPATIBLE WIT THE LIFE PROOF CASE
5 #### Had the " cheaper " case without the spring - did n't last too long and quickly broke from use & probably a little bit abuse . The spring clip at the top makes a big difference in the durability of this holster and I believe it will last much longer than the previous " no spring " holster .
5 #### I love them ! ! They fit perfectly . Just enough lip to hold the water in and ridges to keep your foot from slipping .
5 #### Great price , great performance , excellent product . Overall very satisifed with this item . Shipped quick , easy to install , makes a huge difference on rattles .
4 #### I am no audiophile and i am came to these after my $ 20 single - sided cord , JWIN headphones , started giving trouble after 4 yrs . ( wish I could have told you which model but it has worn of ) After listening to these on my laptop for a couple of hours I have to say that out of the box , the mid to high frequencies are boosted way too much for my liking ( vocals and percussion stand out and overpower the bass ) . I have used the equalizer in winamp to reduce the harshness of the frequencies a bit and it sounds better . That being said audio source has a big part to play , so i ca n't say how these will sound on a portable audio device with limited equalizer abilities . Other things to note are that its kinda small(30 mm driver ) , its very light , and cables are kinda thin . Bottom line for 5 bucks .... you would be hard pressed to find better but if you need better i would advise anything with at least 40 mm drivers that cost at least 15 dollars with a single - sided cord .
5 #### Received my new Seidio Surface case today ..... I had purchased a different case at a local cell phone accessories store and was very unhappy with it . This Seidio case however , I loved it as soon as I opened the package . It is much sturdier than the other one and looks and feels great . Very happy with this purchase !
4 #### I was surprised how this thing repelled water . I still covered it with another tarp to keep water from sitting on the flat top . This one is big so measure and buy the appropriate size . It is working well and I feel my trailer is protected .
4 #### This product was shipped and processed fast . The quality is good not great . It took me about 2 hours to put it on my steering wheel . You need to be patient with stitching and take your time . It looks great on my truck . The only reason I did n't give it five stars is that I expected better skin quality and shorter time to put it on . I would still recommend it to everyone .
5 #### So Handy . I became attached to the USB Charger in my Automobile , but did not have one in my older Truck . I do n't smoke so I had no use for the Cigerette lighter in the Truck . By having this in my Truck it now gives me the same convenience as my car . We always need to charge our phones now I can charge my IPhone 7 while traveling or while working . It is a bargain ..
1 #### terrible product . analogue dial . did n't pick up my local stations
5 #### Grandson loves this product and it assists him in his studies .
5 #### B&M products never let me down yet . You pay for quality and that 's what you get .
5 #### works like a charm . thank you for fast delivery amazon
5 #### The mallet balls are a little harder than I expected but over all they are good ...
1 #### I got the new version , with the claim of 1 amp for each of the two ports printed on the device . Nonetheless , when I connect my BlackBerry 9650 and my HTC Incredible at the same time , they do n't charge . The original chargers that came with each of these devices are rated 1 amp or less .
5 #### I have found , through my experience , that Maxell XLII high bias cassette tapes are highly durable , long lasting , and play back very clear sound . While high bias tapes are not the absolute best for recording from CDs ( metal bias tapes are ) , they are a big step up from normal bias tapes . I have used these Maxell tapes for about 15 years for everything from voice recordings , to sound effects , to music . About 10 years ago I started getting into CD burning for some of my music needs , including burning my own original music from tapes onto CD through the computer , but I still use these Maxell tapes to this day for certain things . Cassette tapes and tape decks are becoming more and more a thing of the past . If you still have use for them , then I highly recommend these Maxell tapes .
1 #### I bought it because of the small mm increments that I need . But it turns out it does n't work like that . I can not measure gaps of e.g. .13 or other even though it is stated in the ad . Looking at the tool , it seems that each blade has two sizes , the smallest mm size being .10 going up in .05 increments . No way to measure a 0.11 , 0.12 , 0.13 Etc to me , it is useless and unfortunately money lost . the build quality itself is very good and it is covered with a thin layer of oil . I am going to contact the seller to see what is going on .
5 #### The best strings in the world as far as I know .
4 #### Good product for price . Lighter duty , great for home use , not recommended for professionals .
4 #### Phone arrived brand new , beautiful pink .. battery , charger , and book all new ... put in my T - mobile sim card and it work fine . Battery lasted two days in one charge , couple of thing wrong is a tiny crack near microphone grill , lost phone # but can be re - input . overall it a good phone for the price .
4 #### Nice even lighting on the road . Bulbs not very bright . I 'm gon na get britghter bulbs . Fits great in 98 Jeep XJ
5 #### The cell phone case that I use makes it impossible to use certain auxiliary cables . This adapter solves that problem . I would say that , compared to other brands of these kind of adapters , these are made of high quality materials . The connector does not feel cheap . This product is obviously not only for iPhones , seller should change the product title to reflect this .
3 #### Have an older car , steering wheel needed some kind of wrap cuz the foam is looking ugly in a cpl of places n you ca n't buy one anymore ... solution ... wrap . I do n't like those stretchy things everyone uses , they slip so I bought this thing . They used to be ok , I 've had them before , a long time ago ... not the nicest thing either but they work , except that the holes on this one were not spread out evenly and looks ugly but it works I guess .
5 #### Finally a GREAT instrumental mic that works for basically EVERYTHING ! This is a must for anybody looking to doing some serious recording . I am going to buy like 5 of these and record drums , the sound quality is amazing .
2 #### Unless your microphones are incredibly short , this will not work . The top could n't begin to close with 4 ( wired ) Monoprice dynamic vocal mics in it , and they are only 7.5 inches tall . Because of this we did not get to test its durability -- it may well be durable or it may not . But it was not tall enough for me to use with my band .
5 #### It works like a plug should work . I do n't know how it could end up with a bad review .
5 #### One thing you ca n't easily find in reading through Pentax 's documentation is that this little remote will work as a trigger for your camera just as the Remote F will . That , and it will cost you a lot less . I ca n't say it is better or worse than the Remote F , but it has all the same functions . The only flaw maybe for those who use the added grip ; this remote wo n't fit into the spot provided for a remote . Never - the - less , I do n't find it a big deal as I am sure most wo n't , unless you really use the thing a lot . This items is a great deal , altough as others have noted , be aware of the shipping fees . * * * * UPDATE * * * * I recently purchased a Pentax K5 and want to report that this remote will for it as well . I 'm not sure that it is any better than other Pentax controllers , but if the price is right for you , it will serve you well . It still has a nice shape and form and slides nicely into a small camera bag pocket . I 'm not sure the K5 grip has a space for a controller ( even the Remote F ) , but the ability to slide a remote into the grip is a minor convenience that can be compensated for with camera straps or your camera bag .
5 #### Using this to power 3 pedals ( using a 5 - connector 9v expander cable connected first to a TC Electronics Polytune which has in / out 9v jacks ) . Handles the job with no problem .
5 #### I love these strings . They sound great on both my Gibson J-50 and Taylor 314 initially and keep sounding great for months of heavy use .
4 #### I had been using a brand x power cord for the last two years and false laser alerts were becoming more and more common - to the point that I nearly could n't use it . Read on line that it could be a poor connection with power source . Decided to try it . Shamalama ding dong , it solved the problem !
1 #### I needed a charger for my boyfriend 's truck so that I would n't forget mine from my car when we went on trips . I figured this would be neat since it coiled back up inside itself , however , the main reason I needed it was to charge my phone . It does NOT charge . It barely stays in the connection port .
5 #### Everyone has a favorite , these picks are perfect . They do wear out .... but they do so slowly . You can really milk one of these along if you must . They even survive when you wash them in your clothes .
2 #### Everything worked when I received it , but the quality is dirt poor . I ordered several sets of these , and many of them fell apart on me . One of my wall charger has a weird quirk where the phone is completely locked up when it is plugged in , so you ca n't use the phone until you unplug it .
5 #### Excellent strings , could n't be better ! Feels awesome , gentle to your finger , and the sound rocks . I vote for this to be No . 1 strings for acoustic guitars .
5 #### Good string ! it 's perfect for my acoustic guitar and the sound is good , this string in my guitar always break and this string is the best option to replace it ! Thank 's
5 #### When I get a new expensive phone I want to ensure I have all the protection I need so I go crazy and buy all I think I need . Good product . Buy it .
4 #### Tonal quality is subjective so this review would be as well . However , I can say that these strings seem to hold up well and sound great in my opinion .
4 #### These mics are a moderately good deal , given the price - but that may be the greatest selling point . Compared to other , higher - performing microphones , these mics do n't really offer the same brilliance and colour in the sound they capture , but ... for $ 70 , it 's a great kit to have on hand , or just to get started with your home studio .
5 #### Yes , there is a difference in longevity and clarity . Being an initial skeptic , I 've since tossed out cables that were cheap but had shorts , buzzes and rfi problems until i started getting the Mogami and like high quality cables . Quality costs but is worth it in the long run .
5 #### Fit was perfect and work as they were planned and easy to install .
2 #### I drove over my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Motorola - H715 - Black - Universal - Bluetooth - Handsfree - Headset - with - Travel - Charger - and - Car - Charger / dp / B001VT8F8I / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Motorola H715 Black Universal Bluetooth Handsfree Headset with Travel Charger and Car Charger</a>&nbsp;one morning and was forced to switch to the Sennheiser as I had bought one to test for my wife . Pros : Comfortable ! I could wear it and teach tennis which I could n't do with the Moto . Turns on and off by extending the boom . Lets you turn it on only when you need it , just like the Moto earpiece . Cons : Not as much volume as the Moto . Hard to get it into the right place to hear clearly on your ear . Uses micro - USB connector and it is very hard to insert the charger cable . People on the other end complained about echo . TOTALLY FAILED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF USE ! First it said it needed a charge right after it was charged overnight , then it just died . No lights , no nothing . Can not recommend . Can recommend the Motorola H710 and H715 . They work great ( until you run over them with your car . )
5 #### This is a good ethernet cable . I bought it when I noticed my college 's wireless internet would cut out every so often , and this cord works perfectly to connect me to the internet with no interruptions . The price is also extremely reasonable , and I would get this again if I needed another one .
5 #### It really repels the water so well , that a highway speeds I rather not use the wipers and let the water fly off , because the wipers are mroe instrusive than the beads of water literally flying off the windshield . I applied it months ago , and still effective . I need to reapply to get the perfect effect again , but the little bottle has enough for many applications . I really love it .
5 #### Keeps chsrge and is not as heavy as people say !
1 #### Did not work ! Came in 2 unmatched parts . Seems as if cobbled together to try to get it for said device
5 #### the cover do what it made for .. cover my phone ... and protect from getting damage ... well by it if i need to .
5 #### Good Pitch , Solid Construction . Sounds very much like the cowbells I remember from a lot of old rock songs . Depending on how you hold it you will get several different and good tones . The mounting base is nice and it will eventually get mounted on my E - drumkit 's frame .
1 #### I got the tripod fast but , the packaging was horrible ! Some parts are broken and ca n't use the tripod . I think it would have worked fine but the packaging was crap . I still have n't gotten in touch with anyone about it . I want it replaced ! Basically the part that 's broken is where I ca n't extend it up to the 12 feet . So it wo n't go up cause the knob is broken off and I ca n't extend ! Bummer !
1 #### First all I hate gig bags hate em I bought one of these cases for a little Martin 3 years ago I liked it worked well got another one for another little Martin the other day took 3 weeks to get here an it was terrible the latches feel like if you open it a dozen times that will be it they 'll break for sure 80 bucks is a lot for this case I got a regular full size case for 30 bucks off Craigslist an put a towel in it works great if you get one I hope it 's better than what I got JUNK it 's going back good luck
2 #### No objections except this thing has a battery leak . It will use up a transistor radio battery in 6 weeks or so whether I use it or not . Maybe I have a bad unit or maybe it 's a design flaw . In any case it 's not worth spending a lot of time for the price of this thing ; I 'll just buy another brand . But in the meantime , other buyers , beware .
5 #### Its a bit tough to use with my iPhone bumper on the phone . But , it works well once its in .
4 #### Got a laptop ? Got carpal tunnel ? Tired of the trackpad ? This ergonomic shape fits right under your hand and helps you rest your wrist . And it 's wireless .
5 #### Perfect for my Goldtop , it had the black 5 ply pick - guard and pick - up selector switch plate , but Gold knobs .. So now it looks simpatico ! !
5 #### Anyone that uses sea foam knows what to expect , it 's sea foam .
5 #### I 'm a heavy power user when it comes to my phones and tablet . Unfortunately , my daughters are taking after me . I have not been disappointed in buying them this great little unit . We often take long car rides and this battery has saved me from quite a few rides where my kids have drained their phones . By way of stress relief alone , it has paid for itself a few times over . Great and reliable battery .
5 #### A great piece of merchandise if all you want isd a phone ..
2 #### These cameras suck . Horrible focus area , and the film does n't like low light . Probably good for a kid 's swim party , but that 's about it .
1 #### Does n't stay put in the cig socket and eventually rolls to one side or the other after a few minutes . Tried bending it all sorts of way to " prop " it against the dash or console to keep it stable ... but no go . It ended up in the donation box after a month . Not worth it , in my opinion .
5 #### Amd pretty looking case and pretty solid case nice to have in your collection ca nt really complain . My mom loves it
2 #### I bought these to use on a Martin for recording . I usually use Martin strings but thought I 'd try these . The first thing noticed was that whatever they are made out of is " much " harder than other strings . I could not even cut the larger strings with my usual wire cutters . After mounting , they play like Mediums rather than Medium - Lights - perhaps because they are a harder material- and the strings can not be " bent " while playing . Extremely stiff and hard . The tone is harsh and wanders . It is not uncommon to hear an old string wander from the note going flat after plucked , but these did it immediately . Hard to tune as well , particularly the G string - kept wanting to jump over the correct setting . I have never had any of these issues with the Martin strings- I would not buy these again .
2 #### I read another review that using cardboard works good , I can confirm that . Used this on a truck in gravel and although it would move with effort over the gravel the cardboard in the end worked out much better and cost nothing . Its a monster size compared to other creepers and the huge wheel pockets make it difficult to work around . Try the cardboard in uneven surface and use the smaller creepers in the workshops .
1 #### Amazing ! When you open the box , you are greeted with WM - Pros not WLX - Pros . It 's printed right on the modules ! Transmitter range is awful ! Mic is tinny and cheap sounding . High pitched buzzing noise , regardless of channel 1 or 2 ! Mic level signal is too low , but since it 's noisy , there 's no point to increaing the gain . I feel cheated and scammed . I truly hate this product ! $ 140 ! Yeah , it 's not that much , but I expected better performance . This system is no better than the $ 35 Sima system , at least it did not have high pitched buzzing . Garbage !
4 #### Looks good , fits good but it has a few issues . First , they state " ... can be installed with a 3 M adhesive foam tape " which could be true if it were included in the package ... which it is n't . however , even if it were I would n't recommend sticking anything on the front of your hood with tape and then hitting the highway ... and the speed limit here in Idaho is 75 and seeing this thing fly off , up and over your vehicle and into one behind you is more than I want to see . Secondly , my Ford Expedition , like most other vehicles , already have holes pre - drilled on the underside of the hood to use the included plastic screws & shims . The screws are too short and ca n't be tightened enough to hold the deflector in place and the shims just rotate in place so they 're useless . To install this properly you need to pre - drill some new holes in the plastic near the existing holes , mark the new spots on the underside of the hood and then drill the hood and use some sheet metal screws . I tried using some self tapping screws in a cordless drill without pre - drilling the shield and it broke so do n't try that one . Using metal screws with a flat washer , short ones or they 'll come through the finish side of your hood , is the only way to do the install . Item is a 5 star but the lame install material makes it a 4 star .
5 #### excellent meets my expectations , not that great , do not hesitate to buy this product . Product quality is very good , bye
5 #### It does get the job done when used the way it should be used .
5 #### This is one of my favorite iphone sliders . It goes on in seconds without applying too much pressure to your expensive phone . Some other cases require you to bend the corners over the corners . This have a surface with just enough friction to stop it from sliding out of my top pocket . The design does not add a lot of bulk to the phone . I enjoyed it .
5 #### The cleaner works super well & the oil coats the filter completely . It is suggested the process be completed every 25K-50 K miles driven depending on driving conditions but I do mine about every 10K. It should take less than 20 % each filter cleaning .
4 #### so far the phone is still in working order other than the battery runs down very fast . but it has great features but takes a while to learn them because they are different than a samsung
3 #### It fit my phone perfectly and it protected my phone under normal conditions . However , it is not toddler proof he was able to break it .
5 #### I connected this to a ZBoost cell amplifier and the combo gave me 4 - 5 bars in a very remote vacation location . We were 9 + miles from the cell tower and still had reliable calling , texting , and data .
5 #### fits 12 CDs and business cards and etc great for small cars or if you have too much stuff in your car , it 's a great orgamizer
1 #### This is no good it already broke and I had to purchase another one and I sure hope it does n't break ! !
5 #### Fit just fine on our tire . Put some protectant on it after installation and expect it to work well for many years .
4 #### I really like this bluetooth which I bought to replace my older Motorola model . I have no issue with static or echo 's and I use it while driving 4hrs round trip for work .
1 #### This is the third strike for APC in my book . Their equipment has now failed me three times . Three different models over the years have worked fine until the batteries were expended , then I buy replacements and the unit is trashed . With the higher end XS900 I assumed it would be fine with the replacements , but the charging circuit is not working . Batteries have been test and they are fine so I 'm assuming APC designs products that wo n't survive the death of the first set of batteries . So these two new batteries go in the pile of perfectly functional batteries that have nothing to go in . I 've learned my lesson and will try another brand of UPS . This product ( the battery ) works fine for me , but I 'm scoring low to warn folks to think twice about flushing money down the toilet if they are n't sure that the unit will work with new batteries . I 'm off the cycle of replacing the hardware and strongly recommend you skip the replacements and go buy another brand .
5 #### Remo is what everyone else tries to copy . Some do a fairly good job , but the copies ' sound fades quickly , whereas Remo 's sound lasts a very long time .
5 #### This is really a decent price for a good set of guitar strings .
4 #### Made a s.hi .. t load of smoke cat gas station like ... peptodismal for cars
5 #### I hated having to put the pick between strings . And now that I have a ton of picks , I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar . I m still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish , and I do n't want to ruin it . But the instructions say it should be fine . I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well , still deciding on that . But for the price you pay for this , it 's a no brainer for any musician .
1 #### Ordinarily I try to buy only top name strings and do n't bother with cheap ones , but I bought these strings on the advice of another player . I had been using D'Addario EXPs , which have given me great service . So this change , I tried Earthwoods and had 2 out of 12 strings break while installing them . The Earthwood skinny G string snapped before it even got close to a G. It is quite uncommon for me , with the strings I normally buy , to have a brand new string snap . I 've been playing for a couple of decades now , and was even using a headstock tuner , so over tightening was not an issue . I continued stringing .... only to have one of the B strings snap as well ... long before it was close to a B. Fortunately , I save my old strings aside -- just for this eventuality -- so I re - installed two of my old strings and was able to get playing . ( Note - the D'Addarios did not break ! ) The Earthwoods sound alright once installed ( remember , I have two D'Addarios on there ) however I doubt I will bother with these again . I do n't like mixing old and new strings , and do n't feel a need to put up with brand new strings breaking . I 'll play it this way until I can get to the store for another set of D'Addarios .
4 #### Ventshade fit well but plastic screws did n't hold , had to use larger screws . over all good price , easy to install and fast delivery . would have given 5 stars if screws provided worked !
5 #### Seen all the great reviews and thought I 'd give 'em a try . Now I know what they are talking about . Great sound , long lasting , and the price is right . Try 'em you 'll like 'em ! !
4 #### This is a great length but you need to remember that the short cable that come 's with your device is optimum for charging . You can not get the same oomph charge with the longer cables . Something about resistance at the longer lengths .
5 #### Does what it is meant to . Currently plugged into my PS3 ; works perfectly .
5 #### Use this 10 footer from my effects components into an amp or p.a . setup . Thinner and more light weight than I expected , but sounds as good as any cable I 've used . I like the right angle plug . It does n't bend the cable at the connection so that should extend the life of the cable . Great price and quick ship . I also have the 20 footer to run from my guitar to my effects . My guitar 's output comes straight out on the front , so the right angle again does n't bend the cable and has a better feel when moving around with the guitar .
5 #### Not much more you can ask for , arrived fast , plugged and works great . Bought two of them and daisy chained them with no problem . Had an old NetGear switch that failed and installed these in a hurry to get things back up and running . NetGear lasted about 2 years and then periodically would crash . Let 's see how long these last . Been a month and good so far .
4 #### Light but sturdy . Not great on the rebound because of the light weight . Good as described . Just not my choice .
1 #### Bought two sets of these for two rigs and live in an area with no use of salt in the winter and the shine pitted and fell off even before winter was here and probably before the third wash of the vehicle . Idaho
5 #### A great heavy slide . Fits over even my fat fingers . Looks good even when I 'm playing at parties , my glass slides always look a mess as I eat finger foods as I play , but mud slide does n't show finger marks too badly .
5 #### This is my first set of Elixirs and so far , I 'm very impressed . I like a nice bright , almost electric sound and these deliver . They really sound great . I put them on my Yamaha FG730S and they make a good thing even better . Short Story : After I bought my guitar , I had it set up and the tech put cheapo strings on there . When I got it back , I actually had to double check to make sure it was my guitar . It sounded flat , dull and lifeless . I probably would n't have bought my guitar had it sounded like that when I bought it . I was afraid the tech messed up my guitar . How could it sound that bad ? It was the strings . I had no idea they made that much of a difference but they do . With these , my Yamaha sings louder and brighter than ever . Good strings really do make a difference . I 'll update in a few months on how they 're holding up sound wise . I hope they last as long as I 've read from other reviews . As of now , I highly recommend them .
5 #### I use these on my jeep when I take the doors off . Makes it street legal , maybe . a foot of 5/16 all thread cut in half bolts this to the door hings and off the the hills we go .
5 #### Very satisfied with the way it came in box and showed up on time , and how easy was to install I did it in 5min tops write before I left for work . Only thing that made me uneasy was the plastic mounting screws but we will see how they hold up
5 #### I love this case ! It fits my BB Curve perfectly . And it protects well .
4 #### I purchased a 25 foot and more recently a 50 . Yes , this is your basic " ethernet cable " for attaching a computer , Blu - ray player , etc to a modem or router . I 'd rather it did n't have the lighted ends but the product is functional .
5 #### This earpiece is style . I would recommend it for any female that wants a piece of jewlery on her ear .
5 #### I had ordered the harness that was supposed to fit , but that one was for the Mach Radio , I had a standard radio . I ordered this harness to adapt , and had to use a pin from the 1st harness to relocate the ground lead . Other than the mix up this made the installation quick and easy .
5 #### Love everything about it . Easy to use and works great . People can hear me . Sturdy but light on your ear .
5 #### These are amazingly good headphones for the price . They have decent bass , especially for their size , that 's why I keep getting them . The only bad thing I can say is the adjustment notches wear over time until you have to finally replace these headphones which does n't hurt at the current $ 6.66 price .
4 #### No problems so far . You get what you pay for , but in this case it is very high quality cheap stuff . No better deal can be found !
5 #### Nice Product ! Easy to put on MyTouch 4 G phone . Choose this one over some of the others because IT DOES have a hole for the power button :)
5 #### This unit works seamlessly with my blackberry phone and i got it for a great price . These units cost much more in stores . I have seen them upwards of $ 60 in some arenas . It works well and connects easily .
5 #### I love D'addario strings . I 've tried them all . I like the idiot proof color coding , but mainly it 's the sealed plastic wrapping . I can buy strings in bulk and when I get around to using them a year or two later , they are n't rusting before I even open them , like all the paper pack ones .
5 #### great product , long lasting , works well after initial break in
4 #### While it does n't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years . However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires . Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to .
1 #### Unfortunately , I ca n't say the same about this item . This was suppose to be the cable that connects to my Blackberry Gateway to power the unit in my car but they send me the wrong cable , i did n't bother sending it back because it would probably cost more to send it back then to replace it . Luckily i had the exact cable from a HD video camera i have and it works perfect . Would not recommend .
2 #### Well you get what you pay for and paying only [ ... ] bucks for an air horn was not a lot . This horn is not what I expected . Lately it appears there a lot of drivers on the road that must have gotten their licenses on line somewhere or via mail order . People are driving 20 mph " below " the posted speed limits . I want a horn that when I hit the switch the reason I hit the switch gets out of my way ... with no hesitation ! This thing sounds weak . My wife said it sounds like a sissy horn ? I 'm putting together the details of an air train horn hook up . I 'm looking at spending 200 + so it better be 10 times louder . I did have a small problem with the way I was hooking it up and telephoned Wolo . After only a couple of minutes I actually " spoke " to a gut that really helped me .
4 #### I bought this for a 4,600 mile road / camping trip with my 06 Pontiac Vibe . It worked great , and kept everything dry during several days of rain . I did have to drill a couple new mounting holes to move the cargo box far enough forward so I could still open the rear hatch . To give you an idea of size , I was able to fit three milk crates with some room to spare Pros - Small , does not effect the car other than maybe lowering my MPG by 1 or 2 miles - Keeps everything dry - Great to have extra space for camping gear , or whatever Cons - Small , could n't fit everything I hoped - Assembly was a challenge because of the placement of the hinges - Feels flimsy , though once locked , even without a strap , I did n't have any issues , even at 80 mph
1 #### the worst product that i have tried .... leave swirls all over on dark colored cars . please do yourself a favor and not base on these reviews and stay away you will thank me at the end . been using all type of wax and sealant , found mothers product to be the best .
4 #### Now able to have the smart tv and laptop wired . Nice since the wireless connection was n't always great .
5 #### Got mine yesterday , what a great product ! I do n't know if you still wanna a bread CD player . But they are twice expencive than this one . plus I do n't think they can be better than this GPX .
3 #### I read the reviews and thought with the size of the speakers it would be better than my current unit . I wear hearing aids and was looking for a unit that provided more clarity and volume . Well it may be from a volume standpoint , but just barely . The voice commands are spoken by a female voice with a British accent . Very hard to understand even by people that have excellent hearing . I 'd send it back if it was n't for the hassle .
5 #### exactly as described and delivered promptly . A good value dealer .
3 #### Good sound quality but I found the way you have to maneuver the ear pieces with each use , very cumbersome
5 #### For acoustic bending and sustain , EXPs are hard to beat . You can buy more expensive strings that keep their tone longer , but from gig to gig EXPs wo n't let you down . In terms of quality , EXPs met all my expectations . I had been using another pricier Phosphor Bronze set on my Tacoma , but making the switch to the EXP was not only a better economical choice but I 'm also pleased with the performance .
3 #### I got a pair of these to replace the hphones that came w/ my MP3 player . I was not expecting a super audio performance out of hphones , especilaly listening to a portable MP3 source . However , the sound quality blew me away . The bass response is tremendous , and there 's absolutely no reason to increase the bass boost on the player . It 's an awesome little product . The only downside is the design - in trying to retrofit the Portapro to an updated " behind the head " fit , the Sportapros are a bit cumbersome to wear . It 's best to wear them in a traditional over the head fashion .
5 #### We love these little Zenergy chimes ! The sound is pure and loud , and the presentation with the wooden base , aluminum rods and little mallot is quite beautiful . Buy one , you wo n't regret it at all . We bought our first set of these , the Zenergy5 with five chimes , as a bit of a lark . They rapidly became a favorite , which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time . The chimes sat on an end table , and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them . We lost the five - note chimes after we had a party and our house , and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them . At the end , we gave the chimes to him , which delighted him , and of course delighted us as well . The next day , we purchased the Zenergy3 three - rod version of the chimes , simply to have something different . We are equally happy with the three - tone chime . Hint : Be sure to shop around ! Vendors offer these chimes here on Amazon at a variety of price points , including shipping .
5 #### Very comfortable . great tone and bass sounds . sound isolations is great ! ! ! they are very affordable and i definitely recommend these for anyone who is looking for a great buy .
5 #### Delivered as agreed , on time . Works great with all CD / DVD .
5 #### Easy to install , and solved the problem of inflating the outer rear tires on my class C motorhome . I used Loctite on the steel valve stems as suggested by others . Great product at a good price !
5 #### I can not recommend these pro - link cables enough . Huge difference between standard belden cables and this cable . Highs and overtones are much crisper . Also , Amazon has best price I have found .
5 #### Very Useful and keeps my Bluetooth earpiece from getting crushed in my pocket . Snug fit .
5 #### The control system of my model railroad uses DCC command ; CAT5E patch cables make the necessary connections between power modules , enabling multiple trains to run at the same time .... JimMc
5 #### Very solid guitar strap . You can notice the great quality of the materials . It is not much flexible , but this is not a issue . Is confortable on the shoulders and serves its purpose very well .
4 #### This charger worked fine ; I took the time to look at reviews first because I was n't totally convinced this would be a working item ... following those reviews I will just be sure to be gentle with this one , it 's very lightweight and you do n't want to leave it plugged in when you 're not using it , and probably want to be careful about how you store it . For a total of [ ... ] bucks plus shipping , I 'm willing to be a little careful ! :)
5 #### Quality construction . I 've used this several times now and it works very well at limiting the area in my truck bed for any cargo to move around . It 's easy to reposition to accommodate any size load .
5 #### This screen worked great . Install was a little tricky as it was my first time to replace a screen , but overall a great product !
5 #### Great Power Restoration , includes proper instructions of charging instructions and how to prevent decreased power performance due to charging to often . Theses batteries have a memory and the memory of how much storage for energy decreases when charging your battery if your power level is at 20 % , need to wait till the power level is in the single digits 1 % 4 % 9 % etc ... The memory also is affected if you remove from charging before it is at 100 % .
5 #### Good solid Ethernet Switch in a small metal enclosure which I like .
5 #### this battery is not thin as standard phones come with but the back - wider than standard - cover holds it in good . This battery was fully charged after only a very short amount of time which came as a very nice surprise . I have installed apps on the phone been using it like a tablet and now watching a movie on it over an hour long at a little less than half charged and it does not look like the battery level has moved at all after a half hour into this movie ... thank you for this great product although bulky its worth it .
5 #### I keep dropping the slick covers so the rubberized is perfect for me . Also fits my DROID x great . Color is bright .
1 #### Having this product for a couple weeks now I can say that it is a lousy product and does not work as advertised . I have not been able to get the Jabra Cruiser to sync with my phone book . I have tried multiple phones , that I have synced with another product . I have seen professional reviews that say it will not sync with contacts . The product says it does , but I have not been able to make it work , or know of anyone making it work . In addition it does not automatically connect back up to your phone if you have been disconnected for 10 minutes . You must first remember to take it out of sleep mode . My wife 's automatically connects each time she gets back in her car . This was originally supposed to be for the wife , but with those two problems we ended up getting a BlueAnt product that works great .
1 #### Units - 2 of them- would not sync or work with any of my laptops . Returned them via Amazon printed UPS label over 7 weeks ago . Still wating on a refund . Amazon says they ca nt refund the charge , only the merchant . Guess , I will have to file a dispute with AMX .
5 #### I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I had n't . The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes , but oh well . Now on to the guitar itself ..... This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who is n't a professional musician , I still want to sound like one . The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson . Awesome crunch and great sustainability . I can take or leave the kill pot . The electronics , mainly the switch could use some replacing . I 'm not complaining , I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups .. For $ 169 , you ca n't expect to have the top of the line . To sum it up , I love this guitar . I keep in E flat tuning and it stays . To me , a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it 's tuning a little .
4 #### Was not sure if I needed or not , ordered it anyway , did not want to run out . Thank you Dennis
5 #### it was so easy to install it took less then 5 mins ! ! ! !
2 #### Short leads and the alligator clips are very slippery . You have to remove the cover to get a grip on it .
3 #### I purchased this Bluetooth in May of 2009 and had lost it by October . That certainly is n't the product 's fault but when I went to order a new one I went with the Z9i instead . The voice command to the headset is a nice gimmick and I would use it every one in a while but I spent more time getting through the V1 to get to the phone than in savings or convenience of being able to command the V1 . I have just received th Z9i and it seems to work at least as well as the V1 and I can get to the phone voice commands to make a call or check the time a lot quicker .
5 #### What can you say ? It 's a phone card . Make it better by buying a phone that has triple minutes then it becomes an awesome value !
1 #### I bought this for $ 6.90 with shipping of $ .99 included . I got what a paid for , a piece of junk . I should have saved that money for a Togo 's sandwich instead . Not only the damn thing broke a piece of my vent , it did n't work . No matter how I adjusted it , I could n't get my phone from facing the sky , which is contracting to what was being depicted on the website . As for the sticky stand , do n't use that . You will crack your phone as everything will end up on the floor . I can not return this because it would cost me almost half of what I paid for it . The seller refused to pay for a return label . Do n't be fool . Do n't buy this piece of crap .
5 #### Arrived fast , well packed , my brother will love this flash . I do n't know what he will do with it , but its a gift
1 #### I have purchased 2 of these mounts and each one has lasted for about a year before the arms broke and I had to throw the mount away . The mount is nice , but not rugged enough . In the end I wound up purchasing the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Arkon - Vehicle - Specific - Mount - Adapter - Plate - Black / dp / B002CQTYIO / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Arkon Vehicle Specific Mount Adapter Plate - Black</a > .
5 #### These are great little binoculars , not too heavy , but good quality optics for a decent price .
5 #### Took these on an African Safari and LOVED them . The stabilization feature is awesome . Great in all lighting conditions would absolutely buy again .
5 #### Worker out great . Have used several times within the first month of owning .
5 #### Really like this antenna . just wish it was a bit longer , like a total of 30 feet long . Have it set up in living room near ceiling and does what it is suppose to do .
5 #### This strap works great . The first sax strap my son had was not good . It slipped when you put the weight of the sax on it . I had to cut the adjustment off and sew it to the right length . Worked great for several months . He then grew , I took out the stitches and made it longer . He grew again .... I ordered this strap . It does n't SLIP when you hang the weight of the sax on it ! ! Thank you Neotech .
5 #### I purchased this because it said it would hold my Galaxy S4 with the otter - box case on . They were correct ! I love it . It fits perfect ! A little tight at first but it holds my phone and I do not feel I have to worry about my phone being damaged .
5 #### I really like these pair . The cord is not light so you ca n't really walk around with them but they 're excellent for listening at home or the office . As others say the sound is flat but that could be a good thing . Flat headphones can usually lose some bass but this has plenty of low range .
5 #### Works great in the car , good battery life ! Works as expected . Great product .
4 #### This product was received as expected and works as advertised . My research surrounding competing products was well worth the time . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for this exact solution .
5 #### amazing sound , you can make any blue , rock and folk sound , and play very nice . is total recomend . for expert and amateur playing
5 #### I typically use pavers I have in the yard to chock both sides of one tire when I do any work on my truck , but they are n't much higher than 1 - 1.5 " . These are nicer to keep in my garage than to bring in a muddy paver . Since it 's yellow , it 's easy to spot in my garage , and they do n't slip . I 've tested them by giving my truck a little gas while these are on and they prevent me from rolling . They look good and do their job . I like em ....
5 #### Easy to custom fit to your phone 's screen and apply .
3 #### Okay so I finally received the screen protectors in the mail ... But when I tried to put them on , they were impossible to work with ... The instructions for it sucked , there was practically none at all ... so I think I figured it out , but even now I am not even sure ... But if I did get it right it sure works good but I wasted 2 in the process ... especially with just a touch of your finger on the sticky part it does n't like to stick after that .... any help for the next time I have to do it ?
3 #### Hardwired it to a Blue Sea fuse box under the hood the other day - fuse box directly connected to battery . Ran 10 gauge wire through firewall to arm rest / center console where I put this thing . Soldered connections , heat shrunk , and called it a day . 36 hours later , battery completely dead . Not starter - click - dead , but LED map lights wo n't come on dead . The battery has been ( and was certainly ) good , the weather was warmer than several weeks ago ( slightly above freezing compared to -10*F ) , and nothing was connected to it . No issues with parasitic drain in the past , ever . So , I 'm a little wary of this product right now but it should n't be an issue for those installing it to be powered when a switch is on , or only on when key is turned in vehicle . Kind of a bummer , going to have to throw a relay in now .
3 #### I 'm not sure how many stars to give . It stopped working within minutes of my first use , but that may because I overloaded it . Nowhere does it say how much amperage you can run through the thing ( other than on the USB port -- it says " 500mA " ) . I have a feeling it would probably work fine for low amperage devices like GPS 's and Cellphone chargers . What I plugged into it was a cigarette - lighter - run portable electric cooler , which draws 1.5 amps . About a minute after plugging it in , I started to smell a burning electrical smell , so unplugged it , and noticed that the plug was extremely hot . I checked the fuse , and that did n't seem to be burned out .
5 #### I just wanted something simple , that I can use while in the casino . I do n't want to have to remember songs I like or figure out how to get them , plus the fact that I do n't want to pay for them . So the FM radio was my way of keeping it real . Fits in the pocket on the side of my purse and ear plugs work great ! ! Price was awsome ! ! Good deal
5 #### This stuff is great . I use it every 3 months or so and my filter comes out clean oiled and ready to go . So far I have gotten 4 cleanings . Probable have enough for a a couple more . Definitely recommend if you have any reusable air filter .
4 #### This is a decent case from scosche ... It is like the apple bumper but has clear plastic on the sides so the metal shows through and the edge is rubber ... It comes with 2 screen protectors and works with most cables ( unlike the bumper ) ... Overall not a bad choice
5 #### I m not sure exactly how to rate these picks except to say they 're what they are . Guitar picks . However , the price was good .
5 #### Excellent durability and bright tone . I beat the snot out of these and they take it well .
4 #### Works great . Good buy . Found it with you at a great price . I would recommend it to others who have the need .
5 #### Great tabletop stand . Pro quality and stable . What more can you say ?
5 #### Superman got ta love it . Also to those who ask if its plastic only the back of the symbol is plastic but the front is metal . You have to screw it in it give you a few to choose from .
4 #### This cable is what it is . I needed some extra cabling to attach a computer to my ethernet hub and it works fine .
1 #### Great phone but I have learned and so should anyone selling these Blackberrys . Verizon has been able to lock up most Blackberrys . It is very frustrating . I returned this product even though it said unlocked . No such thing with Blackberry products thanks to Verizon , if I see Welcome to Verizon again it will be too soon . I was eager to get this phone and very disappointed to find out it was locked into Verizon use . I want a Blackberry that I can choose my server , not be told who to use . I also know that Verizon on Blackberry 's charge for everything one uses on that cell phone . Look at the Blogs . So , regrettfully I boxed it up and returned it to seller which was through Amazon but probably through EBay . It really was a great phone , but I could n't use it . I am going to be 70 years old soon and still work and like to have a great cell phone that wo n't cost an arm and leg to use for personal and business calls . Amazon is great on returns and one should always trust them , they will return your money to your account right away .
3 #### It does a crinkly sound when you bump the plug . I 'm not sure it 's ever 100 % in . But nice sound .
5 #### makes my taylor sound alive realy like them great feel on the fingers great sounds and tones will buy more
4 #### I saw this product , and it was really worth the Buck!!I I recommend this for your home I think this is the best price on Amazon .
4 #### I little thinner gauge than I would have liked , but for what I use them for , they will work well .
4 #### I was able to pick this china up at a ridiculously low price . I had little expectations of how it would perform , but have been happy with the new sound that it brings to my playing . While I do n't use it all the time , it is a nice little accent when I 'm looking for something a little different .
5 #### Nice quality add on automotive type lighter addition . Seems strong And water resistant when close . Fit for its purpose . Easy access to the connectors on the back
4 #### These saddles work great on my MIM Strat . The problem was that the hex threads in one of the saddles is stripped so I ca n't change string height on that string .
5 #### This is my 1st reader so I ca n't compare . I like the sharpness of the letters . It makes for easy reading . In conjunction with calibre this is really easy to use .
5 #### Awesome sound and comfort , compares well to Sennheiser HD280s . Build quality seems awesome ! Cop one of these before they stop making them !
5 #### I purchased these screen protectors as a backup for my original protector . While I have n't had a chance to use these yet , I will say that they appear of good quality , at an affordable price .
5 #### nozzel has a good spray pattern . glad to get a bigger can instead og the little ones that come in the kits . otherwise its k&n air filter oil , dunno what else to say ... lol
5 #### This is the lens that I used to keep on my Rebel XT most of the time until I got the 17 - 40 f/4L. The 28 - 105 range on the Rebel is equivalent to 44 - 168 on a 35 mm camera . The wide angle is a little lacking on a 1.6 crop camera but most of the time you can take a step back if you really need to . The ring - type USM provides fast , silent and accurate focus . Full time manual focus means you can easily adjust the focus without having to mess with any switches . The quality of the lens is way better than the EF - S 18 - 55 f/3.5 - 5.6 kit lens and for the money , it ca n't be beat . You have to step up to L lenses to beat the quality of this lens . Make sure to get the 28 - 105 f/3.5 - 4.5 II and not the cheaper f/4 - 5.6 It 's definitely worth the difference .
5 #### For small binoculars these are great . works for bird watching or even seeing 1/2 mile away .
5 #### I keep coming back and buying more . They are perfect for the iPhone especially when you are using the Mophie battery pack .
4 #### This card works well with my GoPro . Lots of storage space in a small package . The price was fair for a SanDisk product .
5 #### This is a good product , better than I expected . It is made of very strong metal and attaches easily to my GMC Sierra 1500 Pick up I use to hold tie downs or ropes . The best feature is that it folds down flat or can be locked either up or down . A must for anybody that uses their truck Kudos to the Bully Clamp , I would recommend
5 #### I 've been looking for a car mount for my iPhone 3G. After searching around the web for a while , I found that there 's no " best choice " product for iPhone car mount . Even brand such as Kingston have people liking it and hating it . Knowing that they do n't cost cheap , I looked for a cheap alternative . This one does the job well . Construction is not rock solid , but after you mount it on the windshield and you have your iPhone mounted , it holds pretty solid . It has cushioning so it wo n't scratch your gadget . The suction cup holds very well . I use it with Tom Tom app , Google maps , and to make hands - free calls . It makes a whole lot difference ! Plus , it 's universal so you can you use it with different gadgets . Buy it !
4 #### I think that d'addario are the best strings for floating tremolo , I 've not had any problem with stay in tune , even my guitar ( for many people ) has a cheap copy of license floyd rose tremolo . I 've tried many brands but these seems to be the most stable strings for floating tremolo , and for the price you always wins .
5 #### I have been using this for about 6 months now and I have not had an issue . I will purchase this product again . Great quality .
2 #### I bought this reader a couple months after receving my digital camera and had nothing but problems . We followed the advice on the website [ downloaded the driver ] and still had problems . Yes the download speed was very fast compared to using the serial port , but the problems I encountered were not worth it . Using the SanDisk caused my computer to freeze repeatedly , I had to reformat my disk more than once , and even lost almost 200 photos once . Now it just sits and collects dust and I put up with the serial port to download to my computer .
5 #### I was skeptical whether a passive antenna may work , but gave it a try because my office is inside a cinder brick block building that blocks both cellular tower signal and wifi signal from the access point hub that is only 50 ft away . I was getting zero bar or sometimes barely 1 bar drifting from cell tower once in awhile , and no wifi signal at all . After I put the passive antenna next to the window close to the ceiling , and my iPhone is 5 ft away from the antenna , it actually got 2 - 3 bars in cell signal , and 1 - 2 bars for wifi . I did not expect it could give such improvements , pleasantly surprised . I tried it out at home , where I do get a pretty good cell signal , 4 bars , without the antenna . I thought it would give me 5 bars with this passive antenna , but it did n't change any signal strength . So I think it works well for very weak cell signal in dead zones , and bring it up to a level where you can actually get some signal , which is better than nothing before . But do n't expect to give you better signal improvement if you are already in a strong signal area . So it is a good alternative , without having to use powered antenna amplifier , which is very expensive and require wiring and power source , which is not as portable as this .
3 #### Inexpensive but as others have posted only one USB port seems to work . Not really worth the shipping wait as they probably came from China and had to go through customs ...
3 #### This worked outstanding for the first week . Extremely long usage times . Then it started working more like normal . Great price . Works as advertised .
5 #### Use as directed and will clean all your K&N filter systems the way they 're supposed to be . Will buy again .
5 #### I bought this for my pottery studio since the walls are thick and people do not get very good cell phone service inside . It has increased the number of bars I am getting ! It took my husband about an hour and a half to set it up but almost all of that time was spent stringing the cord through my ceiling tiles . Installation : There are three recommended ways to install the " outside " antenna : ( 1 ) inside of a window ( there are suction cups ) , ( 2 ) attached to a pole , ideally on the roof , and ( 3 ) attached to the building 's rafters . It comes with detailed instructions , but there are a few things that are worth knowing about before you purchase . The " outside " antenna needs to be connected , via a cord ( included in 20 ft and 30 ft lengths that can be connected for a 50 ft length , if needed ) to the DT , which needs to be connected to the " inside " antenna , which needs to be plugged in to a surge protector . The " outside " antenna needs to be at least 20 ft away from the DT , and the inside antenna needs to be at least 18 inches from the DT .
5 #### worked as advertised . good vendor . plug was pretty skinny so fit in case . not sure what else to say thanks .
5 #### Arrived in a timely manner , is an OEM replacement , works like a charm .
3 #### This is not an electronic " beep " type alarm - its is electromechanical much like the old buzzers / old car horns . As such the sounds changes with the slight voltage change that occurs as your engine speed goes up and down a few hundred RPM . It does what it is supposed to however it is sounds " unrefined " when compared to the electronic types heard on more advanced units .
4 #### I got it so I could fit my headphone jack into my iPod case and in that regard it functions excellently . However , it is a somewhat flimsy cord , and if you crimp it near the ends ( for instance , sitting down with my iPod in my pocket ) it may cause internal breaks in the connection . This happened with the first one I was using but the second one is holding up well since I have been avoiding that scenario . I recommend buying 4 or 5 of them since they 're pretty cheap and increasing order size does n't change shipping costs .
3 #### Purchased to clean the cassette player of my ' 97 Oldsmobile , unfortunately the cleaning device is not really the right size . I can put any standard cassette into the player without issue- not this cassette cleaner . It jams everytime . Did I say it ? Everytime ! It does work well- cleans the cassette deck , just has to be wedged out of the player when I use it . Not sure if this is a factory second or mismachined , or maybe not intended for vehicle cassette players . I will keep using it until it breaks .
3 #### I ca nt tell if it did anything to my old car buy it could just be my car . Reviews seemed great/
5 #### I have a couple of dark haired bows that I got this rosin for . it works very well , it seems to me . I am not a pro , i am a rooky so take it for what it 's worth . I think it works and looks good .
5 #### For my Olympus OM - series cameras . These are easier than putting in two of the L-76 batteries or taking them out and watching them fall all over the place .
4 #### Much better than the previous CIPA model we had that clamped onto the side view mirror ( which lasted about a year and then straps deteriorated and it sagged ) . It installed quickly and took about 15 minutes to get all the adjustments just right . It stayed put at 65 mph and was n't affected by vibration , so I could clearly see if there were cars behind my camper . We tow a 25 ft Rockwood Mini Lite behind a GMC Savana van . Yes there was plenty of noise from the wind , but the added visibility was worth it . The window will move but it 's tight and we put silicone spray on it . Without it the window would likely get scored .
2 #### Shows dirt very easily . If you are a busy mom always on the go with little grubby hands touching your phone all the time you may want to get something that is a darker color .
5 #### My ' 04 Mercedes C320 has an original leather wrapped steering wheel . However , I put on of these on the keep the wear to a minimum as it was starting to show on the OEM wheel . I also use these on my ' 04 Chevy Silverado pickup wheel and my ' 01 Corvette . I like the additional padding and softness of the leather as I have bad hands and these make the wheels more comfortable . I highly recommend this Pilot SW-101 leather cover . DO NOT get the Pilot vinyl / plastic version . They stink to high heaven and wo n't stretch to fit . I tore one trying to put it on the wife 's Dodge minivan with my son helping me . It did n't tear at the seam either .
4 #### I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing . Size 3 reeds are appropriate for students who have begun to cross the break . Definitely check with your teacher to make sure you are ready for a harder reed . The reeds are fairly consistent , and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds ( teacher , student , school , parent ... ) . The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed , as long as they are not pushed in too far . I usually move students to Rico Royal or Vandoran after their first full year or two . Amazon does have excellent prices on reeds - definitely recommend buying here - especially with Prime shipping !
4 #### The best type of phone case ( for a man as most woman do n't want to wear the phone on their belt ) is one that easily clips on your belt and stays on in spite of jogging or riding a bicycle , completely protects the phone and has openings to use the phone without having to open the case . I had one for both my Motorola Razor and Motorola Q but this one does n't quite fit the bill . I like it as it fits snugly and protects the phone but I need to open it to use the phone and it has a plastic clip which tend to break if you bend over too rapidly the wrong way . The quality seems good and it is worth the price but it does n't quite measure up to the previous cases I had for the other phones mentioned above . I will keep looking for a case that meets the criteria mentioned but until I find one I have been placing my " cased " phone in a zippered jacket pocket for protection . In spite of its shortcomings , I still recommend the case as it does appear to protect the phone and the price is reasonable .
5 #### I 've been using one of these Boss Distortion pedals for over 10 years , never had a problem with it . The distortion is flexible and you get more the louder your guitar is turned up , back your guitar down and the sound cleans up nicely . This pedal can get a lot more ratty distortion than a Tube Screamer when you have it full up , that 's one of the things I like about it , it can get real distorted , but it cleans up very nicely when you back the guitar down . For the price this is one of the best distortion boxes available , it works quite well into a clean sounding amp like the little Quilter Micro Block . If this pedal broke I would replace it , that 's the best referral I can give .
5 #### I run this in any and everything I have that takes gas or oil . My boat loves it all the way to my Harley and mower . Store your Bike or boat in the winter with a shot glass of this in the gas to make sure it dosent go bad . Add a shot to your oil , drive around the block and then change your oil to get out that sludge build up . Like I said I always keep a bottle on hand .
5 #### First , when I bought the Canon Digital Rebel XSi , I was hesitating between the Canon Deluxe bag and the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Canon - Zoom - Pack-1000 - for - Elan - and - Rebel - Series - Cameras - Holster - Style / dp / B00007E7K9 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Canon Zoom Pack 1000 for Elan and Rebel Series Cameras ( Holster Style)</a > . I am glad I chose the Canon Deluxe bag . It is perfect to go on a day trip or a weekend as you can bring 2 lenses with the camera and the charger in the front pocket . There are 2 dividers that divide the bag into 3 compartments : 2 lenses and the camera body . The dividers can be removed and they are adjustable so you can move them around to create different size compartments . Also when I go on a day trip , I can just drop my keys , credit card and a bit of cash in the inside pocket of my Canon Deluxe bag , so no other bag to carry around ... Finally , I think it is of very good quality . It is great for the price !
5 #### Very good sound dampener it makes my trunk sounds very smooth and not rattly . I have my entire trunk lined with this stuff and all you can hear from the outside is true bass no rattling .
4 #### I have HTC EVO n fits like a glove . Great case but if your expecting traditional pink like I did because of the picture;the case is more of a hot pink . Very fashionable though !
4 #### These sticks are very quick and light , they also produce a bit of a distinct sound , a good one . The only reason i did n't give these a full five was they broke within minutes , which sometimes happens to new sticks , you just end up with a defective pair , also note the majority of my playing is live hardcore punk shows , maybe not the best for a Steve Gadd stick
5 #### For setting intake and exhaust valves on a URAL motorcycle ... these are like having a third hand . Speeds up the process especially when leaning over between the valves and the side car . Good value
4 #### They sound good and they were easy to put on with the ball ends , , Good strings for the money ! ! !
5 #### 1 penny and perfect . Got it activated with no issues . I was honestly going between a few different companies and got Simple Mobile because the of the 1 penny . Heck al lthe ones I was looking at are all T - mobile . No issues at all been using for a month . If this changes I will update .
1 #### This device functionally works , but it picks up interference from the phone itself , rendering it USELESS . You know - the sound you get , the BUZZ , when you put a cellphone next to a radio or a desk telephone ? ? You get the same interference with this device ( both in ear and thru mic ) . I tried TWO different std earsets , both known to work just fine , and BOTH had the same interference feedback . I recorded a voicemail to myself , and then listened to it ( so I had the interferences going and coming ) and the message was garbled beyond recognition ( and I knew what I was saying ) . I think this is Moto 's way of " encouraging " us all to buy bluetooth headsets !
3 #### This regulator requires an electric fuel pump ! It 's a pity that this was not mentioned in the description , or anywhere else on the net that I looked . Now I 've had to spend more money on my fuel system , after having just recently replaced my ( mechanical ) pump !
5 #### I deliberated a long time on which wah to go with , this , Bad Horsie 2 or some form of traditional Crybaby . What sold me on this was the boost as well as the optic capabilities vs. the traditional pedal click . It can add a little treble , but awesome sounds are to be had . Certainly leans towards aggressive vs. a " normal " wah . I highly recommend for harder - edged playing .
5 #### This cover fits the stock spare on my ' 09 Jeep Wrangler X just fine . If you put bigger tires on your Jeep , you need to get the Large or XL size . Good quality , not a cheapie .
4 #### This bag is the absolute perfect size for me to carry my hand percussion instruments , my vocal and horn mics and still has plenty of room for cables , patches and other gear , the side pocket is large enough to hold various things like batteries and other items . The reason for only 4 stars is that I wish the divider velcro would stay better adhered and the shoulder carry strap is lined up awkwardly and is taking some getting used to . But I still highly recommend this great bag ! It is sturdy and rugged and a decent price !
4 #### Daughter prefers these versus other brands when s she s not using her synthetic reeds . Durability is just as good as other brands .
5 #### This device was the second wind my old Panasonic digital camera needed . I connect the camera to the laptop with a serial cable wich makes it to slow ( No USB cable ) , so I tried this inexpensive alternative in order to revive my old camera wich still works perfectly . I needed a way to download the pictures from the CF card to the computer . Now , I can download in seconds what usually took hours .
5 #### Seems like it 's a legit Belkin wire based on the package . Works as expected . Great Price . Fast Shipping . I would have spent more on gas driving to the store to pick one up .
4 #### I got this wall mount for my 39 " " LED HDTV . The mount fits well and is sturdy . Good price too .
5 #### Its a fuel filter . As far as I know it filters fuel . Being Motorcraft brand and costing the same or less than other " name brand " filters , figured the Motorcraft one that has lasted 155,000 shows that they work . I do wish Ford would do away with the need for a special tool to do this though . Why on my ' 04 F150 they have one side that is a push button clip and the other needs the special tool is beyond me .
5 #### Simple and effective . I 'm pleased . My old one was the screw type and it eventually ' froze ' up . This ratchet system if far better .
5 #### This is just what I needed ! As described and I highly recommend it and Seller too ! Also a BIG THANKS AGAIN TO AMAZON ! ! ! Always looking out for the customers !
1 #### Mine started to give problems from day one , but I kept it to give it the benefit of the doubt , and 6 months later it went bad .
5 #### This was very easy to install the instructions were clear and ..... IT WORKS . It took me a year to finally install this ( got stuck on the river without any gas ) and paired with the sunpro gauge this was very worth while .
2 #### You get what you pay for and sometimes even less .Sound was great they broke after using just a couple weeks with normal care . Just wish they were higher quality even though the price was low . They should work longer than two weeks do n't you think ?
5 #### easy to install . lets in fresh air without the rain
5 #### My 02 Intrepid threw a code which lit the " Check Engine " light ( actually a little yellow engine ) . Again . For less than what it costs to have a Dodge dealer read the code , this did the trick . I erased the code and all is well .
5 #### A must have for those who do n't change their strings as often as they should ....
5 #### Nice solid cables , with excellent support at the ends . Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp .
4 #### I 'm generally skeptical about Monster vs. cheaper cable when it comes to home audio components , but I did n't want to take a chance with my field recording set - up , so I spent a little more for the Monster XLR . Its ruggedly constructed connectors give me a lot of confidence in the field , and you can certainly feel the difference between this cable and others .
2 #### This product is made in China and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying . This product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format . I liked the original product much , much better - not happy . Try to find Maxell SKU : 290058 , UPC : 025215290053 , to see if it does the job .
1 #### Do n't waste your money on these . They worked for about 10 seconds before they quit . Not only are these a waste of money , but also a waste of time to install . I wish Amazon allowed ratings of no stars .
5 #### I needed an additional cable for my data switch connection . I have experienced the problem with cables that do not have the anti - tangle guard on them . Belkin products have served me well in the past and these cables do not appear to be any less than expected . If you are looking for a ready made ethernet cable this one will do the job .
5 #### folks , this is a ' utility mat ' , not a rug , not a floor piece . look at the measurements . I have a bike shop and these are great for placing parts on to keep things organized while you 're working . Even on the lift or floor to catch oil drips . I got two of them and expect that they will be around as long as I am :) love em '
5 #### Have not use it yet but it was what I needed to take night photos and sunrise photos .
4 #### These look nice . Should work well and last a long time .
4 #### I installed these on my Dodge Ram sport mirrors for towing a travel trailer . With a few judiciously placed cable ties as backup to the rubber straps , these held firm on highway and interstate driving to the lake . The mirrors are a somewhat difficult to adjust as the pivot is very stiff . Still I would say nice mirrors with a good price point .
5 #### While its not your super inflated priced audiophile preamp it has good response and good sound to feed into your amplifier .
5 #### This gives my truck the deep loud sound that I wanted . I love them .
5 #### This is the best solar panel for backpacking and charging USB devices - iPhone . I use the panel to charge a Mophie quick charge external battery with the panel attached to my pack . It is the best , lightweight charging system .
5 #### I installed it on my motorcycle easily , in place of the factory sealed beam . It works great , better than stock and the H4 bulb is replaceable !
4 #### A good product never failed to peal off backing though it can be a bit difficult at times . Use in my labeler always gets a good print . Hard to remove once put on a smooth surface . Very difficult to wash off of jars if you use it on them .
5 #### I bought this case for my daughter 's phone since she really wanted a case with a kickstand , and I really wanted something with good dual - layer protection . As far as I know , she has n't dropped it yet , but from my experience with other similar cases , this one looks like it will do the job under most conditions . I 'm using this case in conjunction with the Tech Armor glass screen protector , and they work great together . I had tried another brand of case ( Buddibox ) before this one , but it was too tight to work with the screen protector . This one has been working great for the last two months .
5 #### I bought these eargels for my bluetooth , which happens to be a Samsung WEP200 , and it fit it perfectly . Gives great comfort and a perfect fit . Comes with more than just three . Comes with a whole bunch . Highly recommended product
4 #### Use this cover for that single gang box , it will help make the wall nice and keep its occupants safe .
5 #### Ok ... that mouse you 've had with you computer must be making you a little nervous right ? That is why you are on here looking at this product . Well ... let me just tell you I was the same way ... I had a perfectly good mouse ... there was nothing wrong with it ... it was a little dirty but it never missed a beat and served well and was on it 's second computer . But , like some of you the optical mouse has for one reason or another caught your eye . Well ... catching your eye may not be enough ... it will eventually catch your hand and you 'll never go back . This mouse is light , and it is large . But it 's designed so that even small hands like my sister and big hands like mine can use it with ease . The two extra buttons are great ... with the back and forward feature plus scrolling you never have to leave the actual page you are at . In the 3 weeks I 've had my " smart " mouse I 've become so attached to it I am at a loss when I use any other mouse . I believe that you will be the same way . My girlfriend loves it ... and she is getting one for christmas !
2 #### My teenage daughter had this on her phone . Not nearly enough protection for a teenager and the finish peeled in a few months . There are better choices out there . Try a TPC case .
5 #### I put some lights no my truck and the first trip out a rock hit one and broke it , so when I got home I ordered these and put on they protect well and look good , just do n't forget to take them off before you use the lights because they will melt .
1 #### I followed the directions to a T but found out quickly that the covers are difficult to get clean before application and that no matter how much I squeegeed , I could NOT get any bubbles out . They just moved from place to place . It made the phone look a toy from a slot machine . Since it would have cost too much to return them , in the trash they went .
5 #### Good air movement , low power use . I use this in a popup camper when dry camping in remote pastures . Power draw is very low for the amount of air moved , and sound level is just enough to provide my need for a little white noise without being at all unpleasant on low .
4 #### these bearings and race fit perfect in my 1.98 inch boat hub
5 #### I hate re - stringing my guitar . These strings do n't make the process any different , but they sound nice , so I 'll give Martin that .
3 #### chain that hold jack lock broke easily causing me to have to remember to find the safety pin each time i used them . metal componenets on base halves seem of inferior quality when put under load . They are OK but I have owned and seen better .
5 #### really like the heavier g & d string . I have 2 ricks & 3 fenders strung with these .
5 #### these 1/2 hose fittings are high quality and do not leak , will purchase again if I need to .
5 #### Got it today . Simple , and effective . No slop ! A must have !
5 #### No pop in the vocals , this Shure SM58 is the world standard for vocals , I 've used these mics for over 30 years , singing around the world and no other mic comes close for quality of sound and build , do n't waste your money on more expensive brands , get a Shure SM58 for your next vocal gig .
4 #### Bought this to mount a eTrex HCx to my dirt bike . At first I freaked out because it included a new back cover that fits into the handle bar clamp . That cover does not fit the HCx . But then I realized my eTrex HCx came with the snap on piece that that fits into the handle bar clamp . The rubber spacers work great keeping the unit tight on the handle bars . However the GPS rattled a little bit once in was snapped into the handle bar clamp . I put some black tape inside to take up the space and it 's all good now . I just figure with all the bumps that come with trail riding , I did not want the unit to rattle around . Overall looks like a sturdy product . Glad to have my GPS mounted now , so I do n't have to keep pulling it from my bag .
4 #### I like this pick . You ca n't see it in the picture , but it 's actually transparent yellow . The pick has a slightly rubbery feel to it , and feels more natural than a Tortex . Unlike a Tortex , the logo does not rub off in your hands . I still like the Jazz III better , but the Ultex is good .
5 #### These are the best strings for my Taylor 414ce - LTD guitar . They make it sound as good as when I brought the guitar home . They are bright and clear , and they last MUCH longer than any of the other non - coated strings I 've ever used . I 've replaced my strings probably 7 times in the last 3 years , and only once did I have one of the strings break ( during installation ) . I contacted Elixir and they sent me a new set for free . I 'll keep buying these for my acoustics . I play at least once a week for an hour or two at least , and I usually get 4 - 6 months out of every set I put on . That 's more than twice the life - span I got out of Martin or D'Addario strings . In the end , these are more than worth the extra that they might cost compared to other brands .
2 #### These are cheap and uncomfortable . But you get what you pay for usually .
5 #### Small , cute with a clip that you could hurt someone with . O yes , H500 headset fits very well with a retaining strap and Velcro to make sure it stays there.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Motorola - BLT-04 - Bluetooth - Headset - Carrying - Case / dp / B000GAZPZE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Motorola BLT-04 Bluetooth Headset Carrying Case</a >
5 #### I installed one of these on each of the two desks that me and my wife have in our home . Now we can plug into the network with a 3 ' cable and we are off and running
5 #### Pros : * It 's under $ 2 with free shipping * It 's lasted me more than 9 months and has n't chipped / snapped / peeled * Looks really nice imo I would buy this again in a heartbeat if it ever broke or was lost .
1 #### I would n't recommend these cases . The price is right but you get what you pay for . I bought two of these cases and they were both broken within one week . Could n't handle being put in a pocket or purse . Also , the coating started to rub off on both of them . Do not recommend .
3 #### I 've been buying these bumpers for a while now and it 's either hit or miss with these . Some bumpers lasted a few months , and some for a few days . Usually , the rubber will start to rip off the plastic sides . They are not genuine apple products but for the price I ca nt complain .
4 #### Looked for an otterbox for my husband and found this . For the price I decided to give it a try , it is about 1/3 the price of the one that he was going to get from Sprint . We received in a few days and it works just fine . He works in construction so his phone is always getting dirty , and dusty . Would definitely buy it again .
5 #### excellent for anyone with a Cadillac stainless steel will not rust
5 #### Great buy ! Cleared up the strange error messages that I got from the card i used from my old phone .
5 #### This is a great buy if you are looking to split your incoming internet into two , or more , devices . I bought this for my Father , so he could have his PC connected to the internet at the same time as his Roku box . This was extremely easy to set up , even for a 57 year old who abhors modern day technology -- he did it on his own . I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality , cheaply priced ethernet switch . If you are looking for an ethernet cable , look at MediaBridge 's products , as they are of great quality .
5 #### Now I have like four different kendels and I am such a Fan . My darling Daughter n law requested this . No way , says I. Then I see these reconditioned ones with a warranty , cases n protective films , new chargers and 16 gb HD . Had to get it or her . Only cause she gave me the worlds best gran babies ... and I guess I love her like mad too .
5 #### Nice sound once the strings have settled a day or so . I prefer these really light gauge strings because the action on my 12 string can not be adjusted . I also bought a set of Ernie Balls " Silk and Steel " strings when I do my next string change . Then I will decide which I prefer .
4 #### For the price that it is , its not bad . It gets the job done and that s all that really matters . It covers exactly only the part that lifghts up , the screen / monitor ; it does n't cover from the top top piece where it says " Blackberry " . You really need to know how to place the protectors on or you have a lot of bubbles . 3 for the price of 0.75 $ is not much to complan about . Came on time !
5 #### This headphone is an older design that has stood the test of time . Dirt cheap when on sale with fantastic sound that that wo n't disappoint . Good packing , lightning fast shipping . Highly recommend for a cheap set of cans .
5 #### Great for the price and you ca n't find it any where else for a good price like this
5 #### I 've been looking for this style ( large triangle ) guitar picks in stores with no luck . I have large hands ( draw your own conclusions ! ) and need large picks to retain control . I have 2 HERCO brand large triangle picks I 've managed to retain since the mid sixties that I 've guarded with my life . I feared that if I lost them I 'd have to learn to settle for the standard " girly " size pick there after . These are the right size and easy to hang on to . Thanks Fender and Amazon .
5 #### Great strings and stay in tune . I have them on my Les Paul and ES 335 .
5 #### This kit made my 5 - year - old K&N filter look like new . And it took only a few minutes with very little effort .
5 #### does the job , used to go nuts with paperclip before this ...
5 #### I recently purchased the H710 was amazed with the sound quality , the volume and the comfort . I had purchased other bluetooh headsets from jabra , motorola etc , and by far this is one of the best performing headsets . The H710 is next upgrade to the H700 . All my other headsets i had to press them to by ear to hear the other person even at max volume and it was annoying . The H710 is so loud that i had to turn down the volume . I am glad to get rid of all my other headsets ( incl . jabra bt500 ) - ~25 % improvement in call quality above H700 - loud volume & excellent noise reduction - comfortable - micro usb charger port - battery level indicator ( press both volume buttons ) H710 headset uses micro USB charger instead of the mini usb in h700 . Car charger is not included in the package Go for it ! !
1 #### Not much to say here . I purchased this for what I thought to be its intended purpose - to connect a Microsoft Sidewinder joystick with a game / MIDI port connector to my computer 's USB port . It did not work . My computer would not recognize the joystick no matter what . I would not recommend purchasing this for such a purpose , unless you know of some tricks or something regarding connecting devices , drivers , etc . Thank you to Amazon for having such a wonderfully trouble - free return process . Even though this product did not work correctly , Amazon is still one of my favorite online stores .
4 #### My husband and I both purchased these on Amazon for our new BlackBerry phones . My purple skin matches the color indicated on website . My skin fits very well to the BlackBerry Curve 8530 . I could note that on the sides it could fit a bit tighter . Not really to much of a big issue though- It 's so close . I have access to important buttons on the phone with the openings that they have left . On the top- I was pleased to see that my play , pause , and stop buttons are covered but have button indicators letting you know where they are . They are very precise . You ca n't beat the price at 0.01 and the small shipping charge of $ 2.95 . If I had been to the mall I would have paid nearly $ 20.00 for one . I think that this will serve it 's purpose quite well and I am very pleased with the accuracy of it . My order arrived exactly on the day it 's was said to arrive ( Estimated Arrival Date )
5 #### Great at moving water , silent operation . Looking forward to testing durability over the next 5 years ...
5 #### To me , this is one of those simple inventions / products that I really like . I purchased several and use them , especially when I want to charge my smart phone . The charger usb cord that came with the phone is too short to allow me to keep my phone on my desk at work while charging the phone . the outlet nearest my desk is already stuffed with power cords , so I can plug in my charger in another outlet and this extension cable lets it reach my desk in the place I want to have the phone .
5 #### It works nice for the price . Looks neat in the ear , has great sound and the stickers make it look cute
3 #### Just put it on my wheel ... it 's okay , followed instructions around pillars , but it did n't lay flat . I 'm not thrilled with how out due to this . I think I 'm going to continue looking for something else .
5 #### Not too much to say about these units other than they work really well . Very affordable and well built - the only switch I buy when I need these for clients .
4 #### I 've had one of these for over a year and just bought my second one . This is a great all around power supply . It only has Monster 's ( over - marketed ) Clean Power Stage 1 , so do n't think your system will look and sound * noticeably * better than before . And , I have no idea why they 're still including a VCR plug on this - I have n't owned one of those in 7 years . Aside from these minor quibbles , I 'd buy it again for the same setup .
5 #### I used the fret board conditioner and the restorative cream finish . They both worked very well on a 40 year old classical guitar and left her looking her lovliest in years .
4 #### These are good hangers and String Swing is well known as a good maker of them I do n't like the yoke on these personally because of the deep curve . It causes the screw - mechanisms on the back of my locking tuners to get caught on the back curve of the yoke . The results are either losing tune because it unscrews your tuner lock , or the weight of the guitar is resting on the tuner instead of the neck . If you do not have the deep locking tuners like I have , 100 % on these . They are great . I have contacted String Swing about a possibly getting different yokes for mine . String Swing is great about communication as I have contacted them in the past about mounting . Advice : MOUNT IN STUDS ! ! ! ! ! The people that say it does n't matter DO NOT love their guitar like you and I do ! ! ! ! If you absolutely ca n't mount in studs , use the biggest and baddest toggle bolts you can find . I still do n't recommend it . I tried it with my first one I mounted ( 1/8 " toggle ) and it indeed popped right out of the wall ripping through the drywall when I gave it a bit of a pull to test it . Left me with a pretty large drywall hole to patch as well . Use studs if you can . Your guitar deserves it .
5 #### I first came to know the company after I received a gift bag full of D'Addario products after performing at the Guitar Foundation of America . Their classical guitar strings are of the highest quality and their electric guitar counterparts are no different . They provide a crisp Ponta cello sound in comparison to a muddy sound other strings tend to give you . The best string for me in all honesty .
5 #### This kit does everything you need to install repair threads . I used this to fix the stripped out holes on my motorcycle for the mirrors to mount . Very easy to use . I 'll be buying more as I need different sizes .
4 #### I routinely take my microsim out of my iPhone 4 and test other phones which do n't have the microsim card . This has worked perfectly in all of them so far . The material is a bit more flexible than I would like , which may lead to it breaking one day . My biggest fear ( maybe impossible ) is that it would break while I 'm taking it out of a phone leaving my microsim stuck on the slot somehow . But that may just be me .
5 #### Update ... Excursion gas 6.8L I went from 8.2 Mpg to 10.3
5 #### We 've been using Trico winter wiper blades for years , but could not find this size in our local stores . Thank you Amazon for having it !
5 #### I like the variety in this pack since I do n't always need the same length of tie . They are good quality and will work well for my needs and the packaging it comes in is very useful for storage . I would buy again .
5 #### If your going from a laptop to stereo amp or T.V. this is what you need
5 #### Ten sticks for $ 12.00 . I thought I ca n't go wrong for practice sticks . I 'm very pleased , they are a nice smooth , decently balanced stick . I would pay this much for a pair at the local music store . You ca nt go wrong with these .
5 #### tremendous mic ! ! love the case and shockmount being all inclusive ..... got it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy home / portable studio ..... love recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic ! ! ! I run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear
5 #### I enjoy this Retractable sync / charge use cable for my iphone . I have other retractable cables as well . Like that I am able to make it compact and not have use rubber bands or twist ties to hold it all together . I bought two one for myself and brother . We use it all the time . Great product to have and the cost is fabulous . tks .
5 #### Excellent work , both amazon and seller , exact arrival , great quality of the product and fit exactly as indicated by the measurement . 5 stars .
4 #### I like it so far and it does what it is meant to do . It clamps on to my mic stand and does nt seems to slip around and move or anything . One thing that I like that I did n't realize on amazon is that it actually has two screens , one on each side of the plastic circle . The only thing that I have found so far that I do n't like is that you have to really work to be able to find a position that the flex arm will hold it at the right spot for . It seems flimsy and droopy in some spots . that s a minor inconvenience . Really it keeps the spit out of your microphone which is what is it meant to do . Its the best $ 15 insurance plan you can buy for your mic :) If this was helpful please hit the helpful button above , I would really appreciate it :)
5 #### I purchased this mic because I needed a model for my station that did n't cost $ 700 , and this did the trick . Its chrome finish is nice , and has a generally good physical appearance , but its sound is much better . Note that it is a condenser microphone , and it does n't work exactly like an RE20 or RE27 . You have to talk into the side , as that 's the way it 's built . It still produces a wonderful sound and is comparable to the RE27 in my opinion . Great mic .
5 #### These sound great and seem like they will be very durable . They do n't deform and dent easily like single ply heads .
3 #### 1st impressions ... it came without a box , or instruction manual ... looked to be a refurb unit , not new . There was no mention of this under the seller 's advertisement . DOES NOT include a charger , or any cables ... NOTHING ! ! ! 2nd impression ... it does n't fit my ear at all , and there are no optional ear buds to try and make it fit ( I guess you have to buy those separately while you 're buying a charger ) . Overall ... skip this seller and this unit . Update - the unit itself is " OK " now that i have changed the earpiece for a round one from a cheap pair of ear - buds . The noise cancellation seems to work well ( no one complains about wind noise , etc . when I 'm on the phone ) . Still miffed that it was an open box item .
5 #### These seem to outlast the other makes . I can be tough on strings the way I play . ( hard rock 50 + years )
5 #### Used twice for Audi A4 B8 oil change . If oil is cold or warm , it will drain very slow but once oil is hot enough , it will do its job very well . You do not have to very handy to use this . This will save you a lot of money from stealership . In fact , some Audi dealership uses this method when they perform oil change . Residual is very acceptable compare to traditional oil change method . Highly recommended .
4 #### I 've been using this product for a few days now & I have n't had any problem with the retractable cord or the plug fitting into my HTC Droid Eris phone . I will say , however , that this charger seems to get very warm . I do n't know if it 's the charger itself or my car 's lighter outlet ...
1 #### I 've owned 3 of these and none of them lasted more than 5 months . Thankfully Logitech put a 5 year warranty on them . Prepare yourself to be constantly sending yours back to get a new one ever few months .
4 #### The product does what it says it does . It was fairly easy to apply and there were no air bubbles when applied correctly . Overall ... I'm pleased .
2 #### Not happy with this product at all . Did not receive what was showed and offered . It is not a new phone as requested . Half the keyboard faulty , battery not new , i was sent a refurbished phone not the new phone i ordered . In fact it still contained old videos from who ever had it from 2009 and 2011 .
5 #### I did not know this could happen but a batch of bad blank CDs ruined TWO CD / DVD drives before I realized what was going on . Thanks Geek Squad for the heads up about that one ! So the CD / DVD drive on my laptop no longer works and neither does the $ 60 external one I bought at Staples . I needed a drive . I found this one and decided to risk buying it because the price was right and so were the features . I have used it several times to burn music CDs from iTunes and it has worked perfectly each time . I honestly have not tried to burn a DVD so I can not attest to that . But for the price , this is worth it . It saved my computing experience because I can now , once again , read and write CDs .
3 #### Purchased the BB 8330 Body Glove ( Black ) Snap - On Rubber Coated Case from Amazon . Delivery took 6 days via regular shipping . Fitment of case is perfect for BB 8330 . Love the case , expecially the rubber texture ( phone fits securely and the Snap - On case feels rugged ) , however , the belt clip is too small which makes it a real pain to remove from my belt once it is clipped on ( thus only 3 stars ) . Once the clip is on my belt , it is easy to push the little tab at the bottom to release the phone from the clip , but somewhat of a pain to reinstall the phone to the clip while the clip is attached to my belt . I am now looking to buy a BB Leather ( Black ) Holster ( my wife just bought a red one ) . Her BB Leather Holster has a bigger clip which makes it easier to remove the entire holster from my belt . In addition , once her holster is attached to my belt , it is easier to remove / re - holster the BB because the phone is only secured to the holster with a magnetic strap - her holster is a perfect fit for a BB 8330 ( therefore a BB can not have an exterior skin - which could prove to be a disadvantage ( less protection of the BB ) .
5 #### Based on all the recommendations on Amazon and around the Internet , this was the best model at my target price . The product actually exceeded my expectations . The sound is superior and the headset is very comfortable . As expected , Sony has not had to update this model for years because you ca n't improve upon perfection at this price point .
4 #### Fit my 99 civic LX . It was rather confusing though . The kit is designed to fit several cars , so it comes with extra pieces and break - away tabs that are specific for your car . The instructions were n't very helpful . The radio did n't secure to the kit very elegantly , although you would n't know it now that it 's installed , everything 's tight , no wiggles . Overall I 'm giving it four stars because even though the installation process was a little painful , I have no complaints with the finished install .
2 #### Taking disc out of CD box it was so flimsy it broke in half . thank goodness not in my DVD player .
5 #### Great way to take underwater vacation pictures without paying the price for high dollar underwater camera .
5 #### What can I say ; its a MicroSD storage card . However it is a good one . Pretty fast I would say . I would recommend it to others . Provided my tablet with the extra storage for music , videos , picture that I needed so I ca n't complain . Just a word of advice try and catch it on sale .
4 #### Bought this to clean off brake dust on my brake caliper and boy did it work . Be sure to put cardboard under your brakes when applying this brake cleaner because it WILL make a mess . Be sure to keep your distance from it as you apply it because the fumes is STRONG .
4 #### Almost a perfect pic for me . I use a .73 mm . Just wish it was more like a fender pic finish ... that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better . This pic seems to have a coating that makes is slightly softer to the touch or something . Still prefer this pic to the fender because this one holds up much much better- in comparison to fender mediums .
5 #### I really like this case . It feels great in your hand and have great protection for your phone . Most important of all , it does n't make your phone look much bigger . This is my second Otterbox case . I think they made lots of improvement already .
4 #### It 's a utilitarian item . Guitar cables are n't very sexy . It seems to have decent shielding . The strain relief is good . The plugs are a precise fit for standard 1/4 " jacks .
4 #### At last , the 6 Gig Mp3 player finally showed up ! I do n't care if the batteries last only four hours . Usually , 4 hours is enough , and you can still buy more rechargeables . Got a fast internet connection ? Got Napster , Imesh , and found the our - mp3 site ? Then this Jukebox will be worth every penny ! Pros : -6 Gigs , duh . -Fast upload . -Easy to use . Cons : -Rather heavy , but it does n't weigh more than my CD player(Panansonic with metal body ) . -Plastic body that scratches easily . -For people who has slow connection , buy a cheap Mp3 player instead , because you will download for months until you obtain 6 gigs of music . At the end , there are some features missing from what I expected(random selection and smaller body ) , but 6 gigs ... No more Cds , no more cheap Cd players ... Woohoo !
5 #### After reading many of the reviews on this item , I ordered it for use with a Line6 POD X3 Live . The POD fits perfectly and the case seems sturdy and secure for the amount paid . The front pocket is probably too small for storing the POD 's AC / DC power supply , but is adequate for a couple of guitar cables . I suspect that this will probably last for a year or so , but at the price I 'll just order another if it wears out . Great value !
5 #### Not just for portraits and up close macros , this is a very functional lens . I have a friend teaching me about cameras and photography , and this is what he recommended , and he demonstrated to me what it can do , and it 's great . Now I just need to learn to do more with it myself ! ; > )
3 #### One of the bolts seems to come loose with side - to - side rotation . I 'm keeping an eye on it now , but it was pretty significantly unscrewed when I first noticed , which was scary . It might be worth the money to buy one that is certified .
5 #### This item came in shortly after I ordered it and was packaged nicely . I am excited to use it , though I have n't needed to quite yet . Thank you for such a great bargain !
4 #### I carry this in third world areas in Asia and South America to get better reception for a small shortwave radio . It works well , but is a bit annoying putting all the wire into the case . I would still buy another though if I needed it .
5 #### Perfect replacement for friction microphone mount that s l o w l y drops during performances . A good investment to assure fewer interruptions to reposition a drooping microphone
5 #### These are great ! I have one in each guitar case
5 #### Love this headset ! As stated above , I returned the Plantronics model that everybody was raving about . The only model more archaic than the Plantronics 510 would have to be one of those hideous Jabra models :) The Motorola is the headset I wish I 'd bought the 1st time around . It is suprisingly comfortable , and does n't take long to forget you 're wearing it . There is no intrusion into the ear canal , allowing full air circulation and unhampered hearing of your surroundings . The earhook is slim and does not interfere with wearing sunglasses , which is something I ca n't say about the Plantronics 510 . Pairing was a snap with my Sanyo 7050 Mil - Spec phone . I was willing to spend more for a headset , however this one meets my needs . I 'm happy !
4 #### seems to work great and the price was right . easy to install and wires were color coded . worked perfect on my 93 dodge truck .
1 #### The picture shows it covering the entire front of the phone . This is not the case . There are giant gaps on both sides , and it does n't cover the soft keys either . It 's not for an evo . It might fit an iPhone . Maybe . But even then , do n't buy it . It makes rainbows on the screen . So many that I was dizzy looking at it . I literally opened the envelope they came in , saw the size , shook my head and put it on anyway ... And then decided that whoever manufactured this is a complete idiot . It defeats the entire purpose of having a screen protector , or even having a cell phone . It does n't cover the screen ... And you ca n't see through it ! It 's the worst of all worlds ! ! You would be better off putting duct tape on your screen . I love amazon . And I love everything that I buy from amazon , except accessories for my phone . Do n't waste your money on these . After I put the one on my phone , I instantly peeled it off and threw it ( and the other 2 ) into the trash . I really hate making bad reviews . I like being able to say how good a product is . But I 'm also honest . These things suck real bad .
4 #### Good soft carrying case . Well manufactured and its easy to take the unit in and out . Good if you are walking or hiking but not in a hurry to check your GPS every 5 minutes .
5 #### Works as described and expected on my 01 ford . Quick and easy install . Great price compared to my local car audio dealer . Very happy .
4 #### I have had this(ordered 2 ) for while , works great , but kinda of ridgid . Not as long as I imagined , but is what I ordered .
3 #### Looked great , fit the phone well , but the top piece broke after only a week or so . It was n't dropped or anything - the corner split as I was snapping it in place .
5 #### Fits my Ibanez BTB really well ( 35 " neck , large horns ) . All I did was add a small piece of foam at one end to keep the strap lug from punching a hole in the foam . Very lightweight , great for gigging where you move your own gear . Not for airline travel or throwing gear into the back of a van along with cabs , amp etc .
3 #### At my office we all ( no matter what carrier ) get about 1 - 2 bars of 1X / Edge . We decided to try this out . We ordered it , took it up to the roof ( about 25 ft up ) , found the latitude and longitude of the nearest Verizon towers , and pointed our GPS and compass at them . We directed the antenna towards the towers . No change whatsoever in the signal strength on Verizon but a noticeable increase for some other services . Called tech support and that did n't help , but tech support verified that we set it up correctly . I would love to give this higher stars , but I ca n't justify doing so since it does n't work here with one of the most predominant carriers in the United States .
5 #### Product : Legrand - Wiremold C210 Cord Mate II Kit- Cable Concealer On Wall Cord Cover Raceway , White I used this to extend data cabling to the opposite side of a room . It was attached to the baseboard trim after wiping it with alcohol and has stayed securely fastened . It holds a heavy - duty coax cable and two Cat-5 data cables without any problem . Just be sure to keep them parallel . Twisted cables would probably make it impossible to properly snap shut the raceway . I wish the kit included more than one inside corner but I wo n't take off for that .
5 #### I bought this for my husband for his GPS and I 'm glad I did . We were always trying to find a place on the windshield where it would n't block our view driving . The base is weighted so it does n't slide around and once the GPS is on there , it does n't tip forward . I 'd recommend this to anyone who has a cell phone or GPS who does n't want one more thing on their windshield ( EZPass , radar detector , garage door opener hanging from the mirror ) .
5 #### Still have this cord and it 's awesome . very high quality .
5 #### These sound great on my Martin Cutaway . Bought two sets .
5 #### I always use elixir strings now they last a long time and they sound extremely crisp ! I wo n't be using any other strings anytime soon .
3 #### The phone is fine , just ca n't do any e - mailing because it is a T - Mobile phone and I use ATT . The color did n't mater I just covered it with a hard case the camera and every thing else works just fine , I just ca n't sent photos back to my computer .
5 #### I learned to play on an all - original 60s Fender Jazz , that was always strung with period - appropriate flatwound strings . When I got my own bass , it was just a given that I 'd keep playing with flatwound strings . I like the tension , I like the feel , and I like the tone . Not too bright , never a bad buzz , and really , really deep . I 'm sure there are a lot of styles that these would n't work with , but as a rhythm player they provide exactly the feel and tone I want . I 've used these as well as GHS flats , and I have to say that these keep their life for a lot longer and can still get a bright tone if you really want it .
5 #### I am very pleased with this purchase . Definitely recommend seller & product ! Thank you for great item and great price ! !
3 #### The old Nite Ize cases we bought for our iPhone 3 's finally wore out -- the magnets came loose and the belt clips were getting sprung , so we decided to get some new ones . Not too pleased with the re - design . An iPhone 4S without a cover fits really well , and the magnetic closure is way better than velcro , but the new belt clip with the swivel is just so - so . It is a struggle to clip it onto a belt or pants -- with a belt , it 's easier to thread it onto the belt than clip it on . The swivel , which feels like it 's going to break when you try to move it , makes the phone stick out quite a bit more than the old model , making it easier to snag the case on things .
5 #### Does exactly what it says it does . Maybe wish the cord was a little longer but the length has n't been an issue at all .
4 #### After pumping up the oil collector , it started to suck oil out but 3 or 4 times I had to pump it several times to get the suction back . It got to the point where I was getting frothy oil ( air bubbles ) , did n't really hear much of a sucking sound when it was done but I got most of the oil out . Where I live , it 's a HOA and yes they do sneak around like the CIA and contact people if you do major work on your car or do fluid changes , with this product , I was able to pop the hood , stick the hose into my engine , close the hood for the most part , and let it do it 's thing . So in conclusion , you will have some suction loss but keep pumping it here and there and you should be done within a decent time .
5 #### YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE ANYWHERE ! ! I BOUGHT SIX ! THESE WILL LAST ME A NUMBER OF YEARS . PRICES WILL ONLY GO UP ON SUCH A FINE PRODUCT !
5 #### As good as the legends say ! The sound on these headphones are GREAT ! They only cost about $ 25 bucks . What 's not to LOVE ? / They sound close to the Bose Noise Canceling 25 headphones without the noise canceling and without the enclosed cups that keep other noises out . And they are not made as sturdy . BUT , the sound is on par with the Bose to my ears . / I see why people rave about these headphones .
5 #### Works great . Why anyone would spend more I do n't know . Best price for this new on the internet from Amazon , as usual .
1 #### the product was excellent , but the cover is too large for my steering wheel - it site said it would fit my car . ( It took me hours to install this cover , double check this size before your purchase )
5 #### If you want the Hendrix or Slash sound , this is it .
4 #### Very nice product . Could n't connect it to the system . works independently .
5 #### This battery pack kept my phone and ipod charged during 3 days of no electricity at my apartment(I did charge battery pack at my office in those 3 days ) Pros : a. Quick charge of power pack b. Quickly Charges my cellphone , ipod , and bluetooth headset c. Power pack charges thru usb of PC or with most standard micro usb chargers d. Fits in jean pocket and comes with a case e. Flash light and laser pointer a plus for portability Cons : a. Switching modes is not impossibly hard put is based on holding button for period of time for specific feature ( Light , Pointer , or Battery Pack Modes ) which can take a little trial and error to get used to . b. Not a real con but probably would be nicer if it was thinner profile Recommendations : a. None , very pleased
3 #### We purchased this phone with high hopes , but it failed to meet our standards . The volume on the phone is very low , even when you have it turned up all of the way , and the phone is easily scratched and show through to the metal . The screen is easily breakable and well as the camera . I would not recommend .
1 #### I recently ordered a new battery from another seller for my friends G1 which was no longer holding a charge . The battery worked better than expected . My G1 battery began to die quickly even with limited use so I figured I 'd get a new battery for mine as well . This battery did not work as well as the other I ordered . This battery seems to work just as bad as the original one I 've had for a few years . When I received it , it had about 70 % life and I decided to fully charge it and then let it completely die before recharging . I 've been using it for a few days and I charge it fully each night . By the end of the day , which is around 5 or 6 pm for me , it 's down to less than 20 % . I rarely use my phone during the day while I 'm at work . I even tried taking off the autosync feature to save battery life . Last night as usual I fully charged the battery . I 've checked my email and received / sent a few text messages . It 's now noon and the battery is at 44 % ! I believe there are some lower priced batteries out there that actually work . I do n't think this is one of them . Try at your own risk . I 'm just thankful I did n't spend alot on this .
5 #### If you ask my hubby I know he would say this is the best gift I ever gave him . He drives a truck and when he is getting loaded or unloaded he spends alot of time on the docks . These headphones take out a done of the back round noises so he can listed to his MP3 player or do work on the laptop !
5 #### this practice pad is just awesomehard and soft sides.perfect :)
5 #### The perfect container to store the convert a ball system .
4 #### This is a good product . However I did n't like using it myself after trying it . After using it , I just did n't like the mirror look If you like this look , then this will work for you .
3 #### They perform flawlessly but I feel like if I touch them they will break . I ended up wraping mine with extra tape to make sure I would not damage the cables . But like I said , I 've been using them for about 3 months now with no issues .
5 #### Great protection for my phone . I really like the way it 's easy to apply . Bubbles are normally going to happen but with this one they did n't ! !
4 #### I do n't use my card slot for any other purpose so I just inserted the card and left it in . Music on a Treo is a joke so why worry about it . You plug in the card and off you go . Works just like my Nuvi 350 . The only down side is that if you use the phone the mapping software closes , one thing at a time . That is due to the lack of processing power in the Treo not Garmin 's fault . Some of the folks on here seem upset that you ca n't copy the card . Can you imagine the clones for sale on eBay . Part of life . This is much better than the $ 10 per month service you get from Sprint . The card is paid for in less than a year . Works out in the county with no cell phone service , a big deal to me ... I love it .
5 #### these have been awesome for my gibson hummingbird for years . fair price . go for it . you ll be greatly surprised at the wonderful tone and long life as well as there ability to hold there tune .
5 #### Complete package - everything I needed and a bit more for the job .
5 #### Got it , it works , I 'm happy . Do n't want to write reviews . That part sucks . Just want to say Got it , it works I 'm happy
5 #### Bought this because of Ice Road Truckers show . That it was awesome how they could grab the mike and use it then let it go . Might sound silly but when your driving and trying to use you mike it makes life so much easier . Before i would have to lay it in a cup holder far away from me . Now it is easy to see and grab . I love it and it it ever breaks I will buy another one . All I did was clip it to my visor so no holes needed . The quick detach link is nice when i have some in the passenger seat and i 'm not using the radio .
5 #### Was heading to bed and decided to try the headphones that I received yesterday . I played my keyboard for 2 hrs . I only planned on checking out the headphones but sound was so good it kept me going . Great sound , I love them ! ! ! ! ! I would definitely recommend these .
3 #### Does n't hold up to heavy use , quit working after 6 months .
2 #### I was so excited at first because it looks good and came at cheaper price , but later i was disappointed because it is not charging my phone properly even though i kept my phone charging for couple of hours its barely filling 10 - 20 % of its battery only .
5 #### Got this for my dad to use in his 35 mm camera and he gets good pictures with it . I will probably order more for him in the future .
5 #### Works as advertised . Bought 3 and then bought 3 more . Love em ? You bet ! ! !
1 #### The holder vibrates a lot and is almost imposible keep an eye on the screen . And it keep falling from the windshield and because one time my door was opened , the holder touched the street and broke in two .
5 #### Put these on both of my American Standard P - Basses ... Love them . Punchier , as someone else said , " thumpier" ... these growl ... glad I got them . For 60 - 70 bucks , this is a great upgrade .
5 #### Makes turning the pegs way faster . Sturdy enough to last .
4 #### My daughter wears out her phone case in less than 3 months . She has always used the rubberized hard cases and the design wears off . This is advertised as a hard case ( my wifes hard case is almost a year old and the design is still intact)so she begged me to get it for her ( as she really liked the design ) . Well it is a rubberized hard case like all the others she has gotten . It does fit nice and seems well made . Time will tell if the design holds up . Upon reviewing the item details I see that it is listed as rubberized ( kids do n't take the time to read do they ? ) I took 1 star off for the kinda High shipping ( wish they would make more of these cases Super Saver Eligible ) , and for the slightly misleading title . All in all if this lasts for 3 months I 'll be happy . Oh it also includes a cute carry bag which my daughter was tickled silly over !
5 #### I use this item to secure small Flash Drives , that have the tendency to suddenly vanish under myriads of paper and other things on the table . I hook the thing on the flash drives and hang on the wall with push pin . I have a low feeling that these things can be put on mobile phone . ( For what ? ) All said and done , I have to thank the vender and AMAZON .
4 #### This is a very convenient device , its small and easily fits into your pocket . Charges everything I throw at it . Not literally . the laser pointer is a very cool feature especially if you have cats . the flashlight also is a nice feature although i wish it were brighter . Extremely easy to use , and does a great job charging my ipads and iphone . I love the fact it small enough to go into my pocket and not be too big and bulky . i bought one loved it so much and bought two more to keep the kids ipads charging . i would highly recommend this product . great bang for your buck when stacked up to competitors products .
5 #### I have tried many type of strings , these Elixir are by far the best at least for my style of guitar playing . The sound is great they really do outlast other brands .
1 #### Never will buy it again ! ! ! useless & after few hours like I did not put anything on the seat ! !
5 #### Bought this to stop the CURT 45070 ball mount from rattling around while towing my car behind a motorhome on a dolly with almost 0 hitch weight . The only thing I had to do was cut a notch in the piece that angles up to fit around the reinforcing piece of 1/4 inch plate that supports the 6 inch drop ball mount . Only took 10 minutes with a hack saw , some smoothing , filing , and a little dab of gloss black paint and it looks like the tightener was designed that way . And the thing works like a charm ; ball mount is tight and quiet , with no movement whatsoever . Towed the car about 1000 miles so far , and glad to not hear all that clanking every time the tow dolly brakes apply , release , turn , whatever . Blissfully quiet back there ...
5 #### Works as advertised . I needed a replacement for the internal drive on my Lenovo Y510 which had failed . Since the failure on the internal drive had happened before , I did n't want to deal with that again . Having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the OS had been loaded on it , an internal drive would be rarely needed .
5 #### very good i love it . its work very good . no complain at all . i will tell every one buy this .
2 #### Did n't care for this one . I wanted to use the single sided over the ear hook and it was super floppy . If you want to use the over the head holder it should work better .
5 #### These are one of the best headphones that can be bought for the money ! PROS - Great sound , I listen to Rock and Pop mp3 music mainly , and that sounds great ! All friends who are accustomed to junk earphones that come with the iPods are just amazed when they listen through this ! - Comfort ! You just do n't feel them on your head after some time . - Lifetime Warranty ! I bought them at Amazon in 2004 . Was having some troubles with one earpiece not working properly , and all the foams were gone . I got them repaired absolutely free ( just paying the shipping costs ) , and that too in India ! They are like new now . - Price ! Bought them for $ 35 at amazon . - Portability is decent . They fold and do n't take much space . CONS - Sound leaks . I use them at office , and cubicle mates sometimes tell me to lower the volume - Looks , as others have said , they definitely look awkward . Overall , unless you want earbuds / noise cancelling phones / audiophile quality , you can not go wrong with these .
5 #### This stuff really works . buy this if you want plastic to really shine and it brings the best out of the covering .
5 #### These are really great picks for jazz guitar : they 're thick without being unwieldy , they feel great in the hand , and you can get everything from silky runs to percussive , chopping rhythm . I like them for hybrid picking too , as I do n't have nails and I get a nice blend between the pick and meat of my fingers . While I do n't use them for bluegrass flatpicking ( yet - I still like a traditional sharper point for that ) , they are excellent mando picks . Between their thickness and the rounded tip , they are helpful in building cross - picking speed , and give the same , satisfying chop on the mandolin as on a flatwound - strung Jazz box . I like 'em .
4 #### very comfortable fit and adjustable . i really liked the pouch that s included in the pack . audio quality is top notch and it does a good job of dampening background noise with it snug earpiece . bluetooth connection delivers clear and crisp audio . if you do n't have a bluetooth system , you 're still in luck . this unit comes with a micro usb - audio jack cable that converts it to a regular headset my only grouse is that the touch sesnsitive audio control does nt work with a lot of my devices when i 'm playing music
5 #### Bottles were bigger than expected ( like pledge bottle size but a little fatter ) . The box was strong and in good shape . Products came on time ( surprised with UPS lol ) . Wally World wanted same price for smaller ones . I would buy again . What you see in picture is what you get ( aside from the K and N box ) .
5 #### Great ! ! Very comfortable and it is what my husband really wanted , with the grips and color ... Thanks ! Nice wheel cover . Looks good .
5 #### Worked Flawlessly , my technique , not so much . When I repaint the parts of the truck in spring that I screwed up , I will buy another . I do n't clean these guns at this price , they are disposable . I was spraying urethane , 55 , fast reducer , 10 % .
5 #### Comes with a light that illuminates the dial when turned on . I purchased this to monitor a solar generator that I built . I use a switch to disconnect it when not needed to avoid power drain caused by the light bulb . After I installed it I found that the new inverter purchased for the same project has a digital voltmeter already on it so this one does n't get used as much now . I was easily able to mount this on a battery box and wire it directly to the battery . Comes with 2 threaded posts with nuts and washers for making electrical connections . Bulb can be wired separately from meter , too . Perfect for such a project .
2 #### Okay , it 's cool looking but there are some major drawbacks even having the newest software updates . The girlfriend and I are trying both the Kindle and the Nook . I 'm thing the Kindle is looking better in the long run . Issue I have with the Nook are . 1 . Battery life is terrible compared to the Kindle . I have to recharge about 8 times for every recharge of the Kindle . 2 . Turn off Nook = losing place in book and on a 1100 page book that means not being able to just go to page 958 it means single forward clicking to get to the page ( not a very good way to keep me happy ) . 3 . Pages take an insanely long time ( upwards of 3 minutes at times ) when paging at the end of chapters most especially in PDF converted docs ... wouldn't it be smart to cache the next couple pages ahead of time ? 4 . Screen glare ... not so fun with a reading light . Fix most of these issues and I 'll be happy until then , not so much impressed .
5 #### I hate giving this 5 stars , as they really are n't that great , but they 're sturdy , do n't sound awful , and are dirt cheap .
5 #### I absolutely love these strings , they sound excellent with awesome tone ( I Play Metal Rock ) plus they last a few days longer than the standard version of their strings . The 3 pack is a great deal and that is the way I buy my stings now . Very happy with the tone and durability .
4 #### Great product . Does what it is intended for . Service from Elago Design was prompt and the item came as described . So far , no problems , but I suspect that it will eventually wear out .
5 #### My 15 year old sister is crazy about Dr Who so I thought this little charm would be a great thing for her Christmas stocking when we all got together . She loved it and strung it to her cell phone right away . It randomly lit up throughout the day so everyone was pleased and found it kind of funny that her butt pocket would occasionally light up and flash . It 's pretty bright so you 'll have to be okay with this thing attracting attention where ever you put it .
4 #### Fit great into my jeep grand Cherokee 98 . Had to saw off a couple notches but that 's normal with these universal kits it just did not go well with the kenwood KDC-225U stereo I bought . The stereo wants to slide out .
5 #### works great its small size makes great to add to 4 wheeler thank you
4 #### It seems to work . I was surprised that it did not have a 2.1A port and a 1A port like other models .
5 #### we use this phone as a back up ... found in our drawer of lost phones , and I bought the charger since the old one was lost or thrown out . So glad they carry older accessories . thanks
3 #### It 's OK . Did not fit my application . The hole seems kind of small to accommodate many spare tire holders .
5 #### I have a Banks air filter and a K&N air filter and both need maintenance . Being able to buy this oil in bulk is great .
1 #### Fell apart within days . Material shredded and seems feel apart . I loved the look of it and the option of horizontal or vertical . But horrible manufacturing . Horrible . I should have listened to other reviewers . I ca n't believe this product is still offered . My dog ate it before I could send it back .
5 #### I 'm glad I ordered this part . It looks allot better than the original . Next comes switch knob and washer . Then jack plate . I 'm very happy with these parts .
5 #### Another " boss " BOSS pedal ! This chorus has been around for some time , but since 2001 has been changed from analog to digital ( funny how they kept the same name ! ) Mine is digital of course and I think it 's a fantastic pedal . It adds that thickness , chime , lush , and liquidity you expect from a chorus . The controls are very easy to tweak to get your sound . Give it a little to bring out some interesting texture to your tone , or put it on thick for over - the - top 80s sound , get crazy and rock out ! This pedal really is fun and definitely has a place on my pedal board ( even though I only use it about 20 % of the time , its a keeper ! ) If you want the option to go stereo , this is a great way to split you signal ! Even if you do n't need / want the actual chorus effect . In general , being a modulation type pedal , I put it after my distortion pedal and before delay . There are lots of ways to do signal path placement but most people alot like it the way I do it . You should experiment with your own rig , as sometimes putting into the effects loop is worth trying on certain amps . Either way , the the CH-1 definitely will enhance your tone and in my opinion , ranks up there with the great chorus pedals . 5 stars ! Have fun !
4 #### The price was fair . Works fine and arrived on time . I 'm happy with it . This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon .
2 #### There is something wrong with the plug on these headphones . After a couple of months there is a short in the wire that connects to the plug , I have had to pay to $ 6 to have Koss replace them twice . After owning three pairs , all with the same problem , there is apparently a factory defect . Do yourself a favor and buy the Koss Portapros instead , still going strong after four years .
5 #### I received them today . Listened to both FM and CD using my separate headphone amp . Also went online to listen to music sites . What struck me was not so much the great bass as the stupendous dynamics -- the impact of the stick on drums and plates , the hammers hitting the piano strings , the attack and loud high notes on trumpets . Instruments are right there in front of you . That 's not easy to get even from first - rate hifi systems . I have also used it with an extension cord http://tinyurl.com/nb8cwtn and did n't notice any change in sound quality . P.S. The cord connection to the drivers gives some concern . I used Blu Tack and a toothpick to fill the spaces around the cord . That wo n't do much against strong pulls , but it will protect from corrosion and dirt particles .
1 #### Returned this product . It did n't fit my car 's wheel , even though it was advertised to ( it was far too big ) . I like the idea , but it does n't fit . I drive a 2012 Mini .
5 #### This fone I had for my husband and it wAs very good so I decided I 'd like one
5 #### Before I moved on to the glory that is the Z10 , I owned a BlackBerry legacy device ( any BlackBerry not running on BlackBerry 10 ) and this piece of technology served its purpose and served its purpose well ! Just drop and go ... or sleep if your a true Crackberry addict because that 's the only time we put our BlackBerries down ! ENJOY !
5 #### I searched around for a TV Wall Mount for my bedroom TV and did n't want to pay the outrageous price I had seen at my local stores . This was a steal compared to what was on the market . Easy instructions and quick installation . I purchased this 6 months ago and it is still holding up and doing fine for my 32 inch Panel TV
5 #### This stuff is the real deal . Been using it for 20 years and would n't use anything else .
4 #### This is exactly as described . Works very well for my needs ..... quality seems good . Will purchase again when I need more .
2 #### The picture of the product is decieving . The screen protector does not cover the entire glass , leaving a black outline around the edge . The protector also makes it hard to see the screen in direct sun or bright environments . Also having the protector in an Otterbox Defender the capacitive screen is sluggish to react .
3 #### I like it but it lifts to easily from the phone around the sides , even with the silicone case covering it .
5 #### Some things just suprise you when you receive them . These did . Very beefy , heavy duty , well made . Much better for the low price then expected . Would buy again .
5 #### If your not sure what to buy you are prob looking for the light strings . These are a littl ehard to play .
5 #### Love , love , love this shower head . Along with this saving us water , the shower head itself is superb . I honestly did n't expect it to be made as well as it is for the price ! This is a solid shower head !
5 #### Pretty great price for a set of 5 395 / S927W batteries . Needed to replace two watch batteries and my Walgreens was ripping me off . The batteries are packaged as pictured , and both of the ones I 've used seem to be working perfectly thus far .
5 #### It 's always nice for the spectators to " play their eggs " when watching a band play . These are fine . Not too loud , not too soft . If you intend to use them in a live band situation , you will obviously need some serious mic - ing but that is to be expected . I also like the different colors considering my main use for them .
3 #### I returned it because I ordered th wrong thing . I never opened the box .
4 #### This is a great little light . Lots of light very flexible . Only drawback is it has a short battery life when used for long periods of time . Best used for short intervals . USB lights are better for long term use .
4 #### So far so good , I have been through so many of these audio cables with my kids I do n't get to excited . But this new flat design definitely gives an advantage to the way that the audio ends connect to the cable ( this is where the problem occurs ) they are much better attached . The griffn product is superior in its durable construction . We have also purchased Griffin lightning cables with MUCH success . i purchased sometime in December of 2014 gets daily use , so far works well Highly recommended , only reason I did not give 5 stars is because you need a few months to really test the durability of this type of product .
2 #### charger works great and compatible with rumor , usb cable fits rumor but mini - cd software NOT compatible with rumor , ie . drivers are for another model of LG phone , not for rumor . Supplier got the order half right , half wrong .
5 #### If you want a quality network LAN computer card by an excellent company , this is it .
5 #### I bought this Samsung Bluetooth ear piece for my best friend and he is very pleased . I talk with him on the phone daily and when we talked last he was wearing the Samsung Bluetooth I bought him and it was crystal clear on my end and he said it was the same on his end of the line . While we were talking he said he walked about 54 ' away from his phone with no distortion whatsoever from the Bluetooth . At $ 21.00 I am pleasantly surprised at the performance of this Samsung Bluetooth earpiece . I have a Plantronics Bluetooth that I paid over $ 100.00 for and I do n't get any better performance with it so I am very happy with my purchase . I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for and I have in the past found that to be true with blutooths as well but I think this is the exception to the rule .
5 #### With the help of YouTube , installing this screen was a breeze . It makes my old phone loog like new again .
5 #### Good for eliminating blind spots and it does not fade overtime like some cheaply made convex mirrors .
4 #### These mats are working well for me . They are in a garage in Florida so with the heat they laid out real nice for me on the floors . Nice large size is helpful and they appear to be really sturdy . I did n't tack or glue them down at all , on a slight occassion you might get a little ripple showing up but for me they lay about 95 % flat . I have noticed a couple sections that have some tire rubber on them but I am sure they will clean up nicely , brooming them off is easy enough all though the ribs dictate the you can only sweep them in one direction . Perhaps a little on the expensive side but in my opinion well worth it .
5 #### Been using this stuff as long as I can remember .
3 #### OK ... You know how you can only use ear plugs a few times because buildup prevents then from working properly ? Now imagine this is in your ear soaking up your watery earwax ( the type I have ... Really , there are different types ) while you sleep . Gross ! Despite this nasty microbial issue , they 're comfortable and I 'm upset my cat ate them ( yes , overnight is like a party in my house ... Cat goes nuts , ears dripping ... Just nutty ) . I love the sound quality AT FIRST . It goes down with each use . So you need to get replacement memory foam buds and change them ( every few days in my case ) . I would hate to see these under a microscope .
4 #### I decided to clean my air filter after 50k miles of heavy use . It was easy , and the cleaning chemical did n't smell bad or anything ( maybe a faint ammonia smell ) . I made the , in hindsight , poor choice of doing the cleaning inside my bathroom shower , since it was the middle of the night . It turned out that my filter had dozens of huge bees and other insects trapped in it , and they got stuck in the drain . Next time , I 'll definitely do the cleaning outside . Also , there was a pretty significant river of mud coming out of the filter , for quite some time . I ended up doing 2 full cleaning solution+rinse cycles , and called it good enough after that , though it probably could have used at least one more cleaning cycle .
4 #### Love it . I 've used it before . I think it 's a good price . But not sure .
4 #### I bought this to replace my existing mSATA drive that had been causing some problems . an awesome drive for the price i paid for it . USPS lost my package & i called amazon customer service . They promptly sent me another one . No questions asked . This is why i love Amazon ! !
5 #### The biggest thing about this telescope is its size , not how big it is but how SMALL it is . Small means easy to carry , and that means you 'll be more motivated to take it out and look at things . More importantly you will take it to good ' dark sky ' locations . Even with the Meade deluxe tripod this scope is easily carried with one hand , that and a simple set up make it fun to use . The Super Plossil Zoom eyepiece is a great accessory , and the astrostar lets even clutzs like me find cool things to look at .
5 #### Worked well for my SUV ( Kia Sportage ) . Looks nice and improved the look of the vehicle .
5 #### These are the best because they will not scratch the screen.like the other one
5 #### Replaced a card that was giving me trouble . This card working great with my high speed optic fiber internet access . Downloads are fast , as high as 5mbs and no problems with the card . d - link is a good reliable product .
5 #### This handy device is great for taking pictures without touching your camera . Most lens these days have IS , but if you have lens without IS , I highly recommend this remote control ( and a tripod ) . The cord is about 2 feet long and some might argue that it is too short , but I do n't like being very far from my camera anyway .
5 #### love it to extend my headphones so i do n't have to take the case off my phone !
2 #### I may not be listed as an actual purchaser of this item because i returned the two broken pieces . In the past couple of years I have owned this item , had good service from it , and felt satisfied even when a part broke . This time , it cracked into two pieces within the first hour of ordinary use without any particular strain - it is possible that I received a headset with aged , fragile plastic . Amazon honored my request to return and credit the cost of purchase .
4 #### This things fit great on the center of a round conference table . It also gives a bit of decoration with the multiple colors , and does n't just look like an ugly power strip on the desktop . Solid , and works great .
5 #### Nothing much to say other than it is a factory fuel filter and meets OEM spec , and was easy to order on Amazon . Cheap way to ensure sufficient fuel delivery that is clean . Dirty filters shorten fuel pump life and on the supercharged motors can damage the engine if fuel starvation occurs .
5 #### Good product at a fair price , would do business again ! One showed up broken , quick shipping on the replacement . Thanks ! !
5 #### Used this to clean the dash in my car and other plastic areas surrounding . Gave a nice shine and only needed one wipe .
1 #### Terrible product to use on a visor for a motorcycle helmet . Left a residue that could n't be buffed out and instantly started hallowing . Visibility was worse than before using the product Visibility is much better with soap and water ! If I 'm using it wrong -- let me know , but the directions seemed pretty simple .
4 #### It is working on second gen iPod , iPhone4 and iPad2 . Yes it charges and transfers data . It is a bit slower than the original cables that came from apple . 4 stars just because it took almost 3 weeks to arrive from Hong Kong
5 #### First some credibility .... I work for a software company . I operate my Dell with a flat screen with excellent clarity . I listen to music all day via Virgin media player online . I thoroughly enjoy electronics and spend quite a bit when I find something really cool . I looked at several systems that would look " cool " with my flat screen , and would provide pretty good sound . I took a chance on this product and oh man ... this system is unreal . It sounds way way better than my DAV - S300 ( Sony 's theatre system- just okay)in my study at home ! If I heard this today , I would pay upwards of $ 150 for it . I only paid around $ .... Now it is on sale for $ ... ! ! Just buy it , you are going to love the base and mid range that this little set - up pumps . I should start selling these after hours ( ha ) ! ! ! ! ! Have fun and here is to start - up firms , may they take down the " big - blues " of the biz community .
5 #### This CB provides a full 4 watts of power in a small package . I have got up to 11 miles range with a good antenna . Overall the quality is good . By Gregg L. Friedman MD , Psychiatrist , Hallandale Beach , FL
5 #### Remo is what everyone else tries to copy . Some do a fairly good job , but the copies ' sound fades quickly , whereas Remo 's sound lasts a very long time .
5 #### Have used elixir 's and d'addario strings and must say that every time i come back to Elixir it 's refreshing . These nanowebs do really not affect your sound plus let you play longer before having to buy a new set . The gauge is perfect for my strumming and fingering style , I have no complains . Will buy again .
4 #### The packaging was n't as nice as the original one . I know it 's not important , but it does n't seem like they put as much effort into this as before . None of the ear loop pieces were as secure as the original version , so I end up taking the loop from the original jawbone . The unit itself is lighter so it feels better . At the same time , the ear bud is not as comfortable for some reason also . I did a test by recording a voice mail while driving with the windows down . Everything I said was clear , but it 's not like the commercial where the background noise is completely gone . The background seems to get louder if I 'm not talking , when I 'm in between words . But it does a better job than the original one . I do n't know how I can live without the original ear loop tho .
5 #### This is a great product for the money . It was very cheap but it looks and performs great . It looks almost like the one from the 60 's in my 66 Chevy11 .
5 #### Great for tightening a sloppy reducing adapter . ( See past review )
5 #### Been using this capo for about a month . As with any capo , time will tell . The Keysers seem to last a few years then break . Hopefully I get more than a few years out of this one .
5 #### Great little charger ... and I love the retractable cord . I do n't like to have a bunch of cords laying around in the compartments of my car and this tucks away neatly . I 'm very pleased .
5 #### I think the sound quality is very good - very clear and natural sounding , with adequate low end . The cord length is a bit longer than usual , which is nice . They could be slightly more comfortable , but they are by no means uncomfortable . I think the main thing about the fit / comfort is they are a little tight , and the ear pieces are a little narrower front to back than the Panasonic headphones I used for years . I 'm certain they will losen up with use . They pivot in two directions , so they should fit just about anybody . You really ca n't beat these for the price . I 'll probably buy one or two more pairs as spares .
5 #### I have 2 of these headsets and have used them for years . They are simple to use , comfortable , and cheap . The sound is probably better on models that use a more in - ear , earbud style fit , but this does a good job with it 's universal fit , and stays on my ear very well . The voice quality is good , I have n't had any complaints and most people ca n't tell I 'm on a bluetooth .
5 #### Almost forgot I ordered this product . I think it took a while to arrive . No , complaints it does what it is supposed to do , charge batteries .
5 #### This was the perfect mirror for us . Great price and it worked great out on the water . Very easy to set up and change around for the perfect fit .
5 #### This works great ! So much better than the cheap plastic pedal that comes with the Yamaha 650 piano we bought . Other people have commented that the pedal is stiff and too high off the floor for their feet . I think it 's just fine . Could n't be happier with this purchase .
5 #### Good product , very inexpensive . Would buy again if ever need more .
5 #### Ever since I started buying these I have never gone to any other string . I also finding me recommending them if not harassing my friends to buy them as well . They will change your playing for the better . Better sustain better intonation . I ca tune my guitar about twice as fast now , and I 'm not exaggerating . Also make sure that you keep you strings clean . Even though they are elixirs , they can still gather dirt and grime that adds weight to the string and keeps it from reverberating as well .
3 #### Really does n't measure up to doing all it is supposed to . I still use my old plastic winder
5 #### Works . Do you really need anything else out of a capo ?
4 #### This is very helpful and value priced but I would n't go so far to say it 's the holy grail ! Several reviews I read of this piece said that someone held up a light and blew air through it and the lighter stayed lit ... Yea ... do n't expect that to happen , but it will cut down on some ugly p 's and t 's when recording !
5 #### Being using Ernie Ball strings forever , the best when considering cost / benefit in my opinion . A new set of strings feels great , whereas using Elixir - type string force you to use strings for a long time , continually degrading as you go . About half the price of the tiny store in my town . Would shop local but I 'm out of work and broke !
3 #### Same review as the other Ethernet cable I ordered above .
3 #### Of the two I ordered , the one I received was great . I ordered two of these and only received one actual Pyle PPFMXLR15 . The second cable I received was a knock off brand .
3 #### In all fairness I have n't tired it yet I got of my motor home , he cab is cold in the winter months while driving
1 #### I do recommend to you to invest a couple of hundred more , and het the 70 - 300 mm ultrasonic . The glass is way better and is faster .
2 #### i have had similar before but it does not work here ; probably because of the terrain ( In a valley surrounded by mountains .
5 #### Works great , charges 2 iphones at the same time , quickly , with no difficulty .
5 #### so far I really like this guitar , I 'm just starting to learn to play and it stays nicely in tune .
5 #### great product is exactly what it is supposed to be
3 #### For the price this is a great little headset with good voice quality on both ends . The negative is that it wo n't stay in the ear and the ear hook is too flimsy to do any good with hanging it on the ear .
3 #### I was surprised by the details in vocal reverb - tail , but the overall sound response is a bit questionable . I do n't recommend this headphone on mixing work . works really great for the booth headphones .
4 #### It 's a capo . Better than most but still just a capo .
3 #### The cable worked good to tranfer all of my Steam games to my new laptop from my old laptop , but it was a complicated process & did not tranfer at near the speed it should have ( I only got 10MB / sec ) . I realize that the slow transfer was probably my fault , but the description for this cable should explain that it is for experienced users only . I had to watch several YouTube videos before I could figure it out , & I still could not get more than a 10MB / sec transfer rate . This cable should have transfered at a 100MB / sec or 200MB / sec speed . Again I will say this issue I had was probably not a fault of this cable , but perhaps they should send some step by step instructions with it instead of making people search the web for instructions .
5 #### There are many pros for this item , but no cons as of yet . I have used it on many phone calls . Great Connection Easy to use Answer feature works well comfortable light weight good call quality I would highly recommend this bluetooth headset to anyone . I even hooked it up to my playstation 3 and it worked just fine . It says it has a 30 foot range , that is realistically more like a 10 . You do want to hold the phone on the side that the earpiece is on for the best connection , but the distance you hold it has not made an impact on sound quality . Get this piece at a great price here on Amazon .
5 #### Got these for $ 70 on sale . Great microphones I would easily pay up to $ 150 for this combo
5 #### I have these on all my guitars . They work very well . You need to keep them lubed so that they can release when needed . I recommend wd-40 and a Q - tip . Easy to install and maintain .
5 #### 300 mm is a pros . Better use tripods or use it under strong lightings , like other telephote lens . Some one may not like its plastic design and outter focus design , which most of beginners do n't mind . But it has ultrasonoic motors . Of course if you have money , get the XXB .
5 #### I 've tried them all . This is what use every time . Why would I use anything else ? A string is a string . Use what you like .
5 #### I bought a used T - Mobile Hot Spot . from " Plug'n'Play Usa " and Fulfilled by Amazon . This worked perfectly for my new activation of a T - Mobile Hotspot Hub .
4 #### I needed new hardware on one of my Tama floor toms . The cost of one of these floor toms is pretty steep so just replacing the hardware is a more frugal option . This hardware is very robust ( heavy duty ) . I 've purchased Gibraltar products in the past and I 'm very satisfied with their products .
4 #### Quite a performer for the money . Worked well on acoustic and vocals as well as using it in figure 8 pattern in a blumlein pair with another mic . Very open sounding mic .
4 #### Overall this is a pretty great product , but I think they have changed the formula over the years or something . This product works great but wears off very quickly . If you live in a very rainy climate , you will find yourself reapplying this once a week or so .
5 #### They work great on my Les Paul . They give excellent string bending control .
4 #### There is really not much you can say about a clean wipe . The product does clean fingerprints on the DVD . I 'm very satisfied with the product . If it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better .
5 #### Since I 've used these kinds of clips before I know it 's important for best results to follow the directions . I attached this to the back of an Ipod and left it for 3 days . Do n't think it will ever come off , and I pulled it pretty hard in figuring out how to release the latch . Probably best to use on fabric that 's thick enough not to be damaged , but would not recommend on a thin tee shirt . It 's not very large and I 'm not sure it would work well for some of the larger cell phones . But they make larger clips that work great for that . For a small , simple locking clip that wo n't come off this is perfect .
5 #### Very prompt delivery and works as expected . Seems well made . In use for 3 weeks thru attic and walls .
5 #### I ordered this product for a friend . they have an Iphone 5 and liked the way it looked . they do n't have an account .
5 #### I use them to run for 20 minutes on a tread mill each morning with a 5S. works for me .
5 #### I 've been working on my own guitars for 30 years and always relied on a folded towel to support the neck and headstock while changing strings , cleaning , repair , etc . This handy little tripod is so much better for working - it features a compact folding style , supporting strength that only a triangle design offers , and a no slip material on the legs to keep your precious axes from taking a tumble . 5 stars all day long !
5 #### I needed to connect a blu ray play to a wireless across the room . 50 ft belkin cable worked out great for this task and now i get all my BD live stuff .
5 #### Great item . Shipped exactly as described . Works great ! I have a Blackberry 7100i and it works great . It does work with d / c but of course you need to hold the button on the phone . I had a little problem with the fit on my ear , but I seem to have gotten the hang of it . I only use it when driving or walking around so it 's good for my use .
4 #### did clean my leather seats without doing any harm ... and does not costs much if you are DIY person than yes will save you lot of money by avoiding professional cleaning .
5 #### great product but shipping from Amazon sucks . I buy this brand for service vans and my personal truck good visors . But it takes several tries to get an unbroken one . Last one I bought it took three tries .
4 #### Although these did n't last the full five years , I really ca n't complain , I priced just the refill blades for my car and a single blade for the driver 's side cost more than this costs , and this includes the whole part , not just the refill blade . While the one I just changed out probably would have lasted a couple more months , I tend to be really picky about the wiper on the driver 's side , the passenger side and the rear wiper of the same brand that I installed in Feb 2011 are still going strong . And these blades have taken a beating , hot , really hot , Texas summers and they have also been through a couple of the coldest winters that we have had here in a long time , bottom line , I would buy these again and recommend them to friends
5 #### Being that cellular Bluetooth is so common - I do n't understand why home bluetooth phones are so hard to come by - but thank goodness Plantronics came up with a good one . I highly recommend this product to anyone who works from home , as I do . And the customer service is pretty good too ; I thought my headset went bad ( turned out to be an easily fixed connection issue ) , but they were ready to ship me out a new unit right away .
3 #### I got this for by boyfriend as a gift . He already had a T - Mobile sim card from a flip phone , but hated texting on it . First , his address did not open up in the Blackberry . Then we tried to open wi - fi and there is none on this phone unless you pay by the minute to T - mobile . Since this phone was advertised as a unlocked phone , and the person purchasing it would be using an already existing sim card , THAT GPS THAT NEEDS WI - FI WOULD NOT BE LISTED AS A FEATURE . As far as I can tell , that means the GPS wo n't work either without a monthly package from T - Mobile . That also means you ca n't load apps and no Blackberry Messenger . Otherwise , I guess he likes the phone . I , however , feel ripped off .
5 #### Ca n't find a value anywhere close to this purchase . They are fully charged and work well .
5 #### Hooks your headphone jack or Audio out to your stereo - Always satisfied with Belkin stuff - this time no different -
5 #### I found best tone and tension [ bending ability ] better on these Fender strings and less finger noise . If you have a strat or tele , these strings are great ( imo ) and priced very affordable .
1 #### Impossible to install without having one or two edges that pull off screen . Have it installed for 4 days and have trimmed it twice to keep it on the phone
5 #### I love the absorber . I use these to wash my car every week . Pulls the water off very quickly . I usually follow behind with a micro fiber towel because this is n't perfect . It 's great for quick drying .
4 #### Very simple construction especially compared to some other iterations of this product out there . It 's an elastic band that feeds into a silicone case . Stays on your arm and does what it 's intended . A few cons : - There 's nothing in between the case and the band , therefore sweat gets into that area ( between the phone and the case ) really easily . This might not be a problem for people who do n't sweat quite as much though . - The case itself is really flimsy . Not bad quality , just floppy , you know ? This said , when I put my phone in there and start jogging , the phone itself jostles quite a bit which makes me fear that the ( unprotected ) phone will fall out . It has yet to happen but I could definitely see it happening if the silicone tore even a little bit .
5 #### SanDisk is a reliable manufacturer and this memory card has functioned as advertised in my dell Venue 8 .
5 #### Great product , very effective , and high quality components . As a few others have noted , this is much higher quality components ( metals used , grade of hardware , nice powdercoat finish , thickness of plate ) than the cheap bar clamps at the hardware store . This wo n't rust and can take some serious torque on the nuts . Now my hitch is nice and quiet . Plus , it gives me about an extra 1/4 " of ball height ( due to the way it holds the draw bar up tight against the receiver ) . I need as much height as I can get as I 'm towing with a Honda Accord . I 'm using this on a 1 1/4 " class 1 receiver so the threads are too long and drug a few times when I did n't angle enough climbing my steep driveway . No problem , I trimmed the extra ~1 " off of each and it 's a perfect fit . I love this so much that I just bought another to have as a spare in case I ever need to use a 2 " higher class receiver . :-)
4 #### Great case , but not suited for check baggage . This bag is for hand carrying to different places , but do not use it on airplane or any other travel that requires checked baggage etc . I traveled to Vegas with this case and it suffered extensive damage and marring ; however , it did protect its contents well . Consider a case with hard plastic for air travel or travel that requires checked baggage . For Gibson owners I would recommend this case over the Gibson option for two reasons : 1 : It 's cheaper 2 : Less likely to be a target for thieves if think you are carrying a cheaper Epiphone vs. an expensive Gibson .
5 #### These are an exact match to the Ford branded shade that came on my 2003 F250 , they are only missing the " Ford " logo . Fit was perfect .
4 #### Using on 2012 Tacoma w 8 ' wide trailer . sure , a LITTLE wobble but I ALWAYS know what 's behind me or coming along side . Those who criticize the mirror , probably are n't taking the little extra step of : once mirror is tightened , muscle through 1 or 2 more clicks of the tightening mechanism . This served me well 2 wks ago on a 950 mile haul ; stayed in same place I initially placed them . The rubber pads on the legs , CAN loosen . Solution : a little contact cement solves the issue . Very satisfied . Just ordered an extra pair for backup in case damage occurs on a trip or they get ripped off ; well worth it .
5 #### This was a filter for my Honda Shadow . Fram filters seem of quality construction And service was amazingly fast . Anazon Prime is the way to go on items like this or things you would have to drive around and search for .
5 #### This case is exactly what it appears to be . I did not notice any loss of signal while using it . There is a bit more glare on the screen in direct light but any time you put plastic in front of plastic that is going to happen unless it is treated with anti - glare coating . Works great and worth the small price tag .
5 #### After reading all the great reviews on this product I decide to buy one . I wish I could give it at least give one honest star , but my results are zilch nothing . It just does n't work . I gave it five stars just so I could get the message out . Nobody reads the true results only listed in the bad reviews . I will sell it to those like thinking persons like me wishing they will get results .
4 #### I use it with a squier telecaster deluxe and it sounds awesome . I feel the classical distortion like alternative mucisians use ( and other genres ) . The only thing , that I do n't know how to solve it , is this pedal suck the effect from my wah wah pedal . If I want use my wah , I have to put this DS-1 out from the pedal chain
5 #### As always the way to go , compared to then knock offs .
3 #### I do n't know if it 's cleaning my engine out or not , but there was a few miles where the RPMs were at 2,000 for a while ... ... then it calmed back down . I wonder if that was it getting all cleaned out , mabey ? ? ? My RPMs started around 1500 , and by the time I got back home ( 30 miles or so ) , it was idling around 400 . I guess that means I have to go it and adjust the Air / Fuel ratio now that everything 's been Cleansed . I 've seen all kinds of YouTube videos , showing how well it works , so I can only assume based on MY experience , that it 's not a load of Crap . --- UPDATE ---- I was able to get a look inside my engine . I still do n't know if the Pistons were cleaned or not , but I know my intake was FILTHY . Of course , the Fuel does nt pass through my Intake , it is Direct - port injected . I wonder if this would work if I poured it into my intake , with the Air ... Yes , I said ' POUR ' . It 's a bottle of Liquid . It is Not a Spray Can or any kind of Aerosol .
4 #### I purchased 4 of these chocks for my utility trailer and the work great . They fit into the storage locker on the trailer and can be grouped in pairs with a rope that fits into pre - existing holes . My trailer is very small with 480 - 12 tires and they fit perfectly . Do n't know how long they will last but time will tell .
5 #### the case is heavy and semi - rigid for protection . it is 2 sides - 1 for scanner , 1 for cord . it zips up nice and tight . scanner is protected and it is easy to pack . also great for storing the scanner between uses . am really glad i got this . feel much better travelling with scanner now .
5 #### Sound great just the sound I been looking for and at a very reasonable price . I now have then on 3 of 4 of my basses .
4 #### The springs were just what I needed . I would have given them 5 stars except the dimensions were not as advertised ( 2 1/4 spring i d , and 13 inches long unsprung , was told by Superior that they were 2 1/2 i d and 10 inches long ) and the clamps are on the flimsy side . But they work as advertised and are just the ticket I needed , at a great price .
5 #### Did its job and It still works till this day , I ve had it for over a year ! Thank you !
4 #### They 're easy to adjust and plenty sturdy for holding up my Honda Fit .
5 #### I totally love this bluetooth . It actually works better than the one that was in my old car from the factory . Only issue is that after 4 months it just stopped working . Not a big deal , it has a 1 year warranty through Motorola and they were great . In aprox 5 days i had a new one !
5 #### These strings work great on my acoustic sigma by martin .
3 #### it worked but sounded funny , sounded whimpy and was n't that loud but it did work ok , I unistalled it and went with a Wolo train horn , think ill put this one on the lifted golf cart just for laughs .
5 #### great product as always .. new heads are a must for a drummer jamming frequently .. get yourself a new drum head today these sound great .
5 #### This cable works very well for my midi devices . It was a great price and connected to all my devices . It was long enough for my needs .
5 #### I never knew this stuff existed until Amazon recommended it when I bought bondo . I ca nt believe how awesome this stuff is . It 's a perfect finish compound for after you fix / sculpt your repairs . Helps fill in the pin holes , air bubbles and works great filling fine scratches . Does nt require a hardener as it air dries ( so keep the cap on it ) . This turned me from a DIY attempt to paint to a baby butt smooth paint job .
4 #### These Case Crown cases are the best buy for the iPhone . I 've got pretty much all colors of the slim fit cases . Just ordered this stunning red slip case . It is beautiful , great tactile feel and the garnet red is gorgeous . Only downside , at least compared to the regular slim fit , it does add a little more bulk . Not a lot , certainly compared to other cases , but definitely more than the standard slim - fit .
5 #### I have always wanted a Warn Winch but never could really afford one . I 've had other winches in the past but so far this is the best one I 've used .
5 #### Excellent ! Great seller , great product as new . 10000 % recommend this seller .
4 #### When it 's all said and done , it does the job , and that 's the most important thing . I personally do n't think it 's worth the money . But if communicating with your phone is vital , then it may well be worth the cost . Installation is easy , but kind of rinky dink . Antenna mounts on the roof with a strong enough antenna . The cable goes through the rear passenger door or window . There is enough cable to run under the seat and up to the dash . The installation is easy , but not very nice looking . I have a number of dead spots for 4 g , including my driveway . With the phone installed and everything on , I get a weak , but useable 4 g signal where previously I generally could not use 4 g. I 've never had a problem well telephone calls dropping around here , so I ca n't offer much opinion there .
5 #### Very convenient to charge my Apple phone & mp3 player . No hassle compact design and a large capacity charger . No need to look for electrical source to charge my devices .
1 #### It would have been nice if they new this product would fit my car . It did not so I still want this on my car but ca nt find it
2 #### Sound quality was acceptable . The loudest was okay . But the Comfort level was terrible and I broke them trying to get them wide enough for my 18 inch neck . Ca n't recommend them despite the price .
5 #### Great product for my 2000 f250 7.3 , replaced the warn blues with these after I had broke one . Much stiffer to lock in VS the warn blues !
5 #### I just bought 72 , which will probably be a lifetime supply as these babies never wear out ! I love them and find the surface ( for me ) a better grip than Gator Grips or anything else I 've tried . Plus , they are pink and the guys do n't walk away with them ! ! ! And I 'm always a proponent of THICKER PICKS , people ! They give you better control and tone .
5 #### Does what its supposed to do . Great sounding head . Love it
4 #### Still have't used it yet as I 'm a beginner but many who play for yrs really like this brand .
5 #### I was looking for a very loud metronome for my daughter 's violin practice but since we could n't really test the sound through internet so I decided to take a risk and I AM VERY VERY HAPPY with my purchase . We have MR500 and it is good for piano ( for my younger daughter who is a late beginner : not too much fast or loud ) but not loud enough for my older girl who plays fast and intense so I bought Kala brand that works as both tuner and metronome.(it is digital ) It was not even close .... The pitch was high but not strong plus the indicator light is in front and the speaker is in back which is very weird design so she could n't hear it when she looked at the light or the other way around . So so we use it for cello and it works fine because its sound is very different from cello so you can hear the metronome . This MR800 , is amazingly loud and I think you can use it with any musical instrument . It has earphone jack so probably you can use it for drum .. (well . I do n't know anything about drum but I am just guessing ) . Anyway , my daughter loves it for its clear , loud sound and I think it is easy to use comparing to digital .
4 #### I was a bit skeptical when buying these for my Toyota Camry , because of the inexpensive price . However , they do a great job in keeping the windshield clear from heavy rain , sleet and snow . I hope they will hold up for a while .
5 #### I purchased this cable for my iTouch that I have in a power case and I needed it for the headset cable . The cable fits perfectly in the case and the vendor send me a special that I did not know about and I am greatly appreciative of that . And he sent the item to me on a timely manner .
2 #### there good , i just did n't have much used for them , and they just take up space , but for those who do use these kinds of things a lot , then its a great buy
5 #### I have had lots of headphones . Found these when looking at much more expensive hardware . Now a couple years old and have abused them . No issues and they sound fantastic . Great for traveling . Update Sept. 2016 - Just like everything that you use allot , they start to wear out . The foam on the ear pieces crumbled a while back . It says " Limited Lifetime " so I called Koss expecting to be blown off . Nice person that answered asked for my address and sent me a couple pairs . Recently on of the sides quit working . Same nice response and shipped them with a check for return shipping . A new pair arrived with two sets of ear and temple pads . I do n't expect wonderful support any more , but theses guys stand behind their stuff .
5 #### So far this has done a great job of clearing up the noise I was getting from an electrical ground loop .
5 #### Honestly was n't expecting too much since I only paid $ .01 but ... it was nice and thick ! Great coverage ...
5 #### Wonderful ! They are perfect for when my annoying neighbor plays her crappy music and I need to tune her out while watching TV .
2 #### The 1st string was six inches too short to be able to put on my Guitar .... a factory error , apparently . Too bad , because the 5 strings I did put on have a very nice , easy to play feel to them . Good sound , as well . But my electric guitar requires all six strings , so this purchase was basically useless to me . Not sure I would give this product a second chance .
4 #### So I really like this remote used on my Canon T3i DSLR , it is made by Canon after all . My only recommendation would be if they made the chord slightly longer for a more one - man - show type of approach . Currently I see this remote as only really useful for situations where you do n't want minimal shaking when pressing the shutter on the camera . You can easily purchase&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Steren-12 - feet-2 - 5mm - Male - To-2 - 5mm - Female - Extension - Cable - Stereo / dp / B00291DM9O / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Steren 12 feet 2.5 mm Male To 2.5 mm Female Extension Cable - Stereo</a>&nbsp;or something similar to help , but it would be nice if Canon just made this 6 ft instead or something . Pros : - solid build quality - shutter does n't click , but has very satisfying travel when pressed - shutter - 2.5 mm connection feels secure Cons : - chord too short
5 #### Wonderful ! Lovethe way the product cleans the lens of my DVD player .
5 #### I bought these for my brother - in - law for his birthday and he immediately fell in love with them . He has an iPod touch and I wanted to get him something bluetooth for it and this was the best thing I could find . What I did n't realize is that it would work with his cellphone at the same time . He synched it with both of them and if he get 's a call while listening to his iTouch , he just presses the answer button and it immediately switches to the phone . As with everything though , the experience ca n't be flawless . First , amazon shows that this one is the blue accent model when in fact it is n't , it 's is just straight black . This is n't a big deal though I did intend on getting blue . Second , the song controls do n't all work with the iTouch . This is n't the fault of the headset however or I would have rated it 4 stars . This is due to Apple not fully implementing the bluetooh spec yet . I assume they will at some point in one of there updates and it will they will start working . In summary , these are very much worth the price and I would buy them again and again .
4 #### Seems to work okay so far , have to fiddle with the sensitivity setting to be sure I can pick up a small leak , Have used one like it before that s why I bought this one .
4 #### Most of the time everything is good with this , works as described . But I have had a couple of lighter plugs that did not want to insert far enough to make a connection . And I had an MP 3 player that fit loosely and had some trouble staying connected . Also be aware of the power rating - do n't try to use an electric tire pump .
4 #### Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear - cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews ? Because they sound amazing . Nothing in this price range even comes close . Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II . Well , I have both and they are both excellent headphones , and the sennheisers are much better quality , but the sound of the Portapros is much better . I am on my second pair , and will buy another when this set breaks .
5 #### My daughter borrowed and misplaced the cable that came with my hotspot . She knows I have a e - gadget collection and asked if I had another , I did . This one is the backup now . She loves to have and use technology but has no understanding of it . I used to do this stuff for a living , so everyone comes to me . Well , she and the hotspot are on good standing again . And , guess what ? The darned original cable resurfaced a few days after the replacement was put in place . Go figure !
1 #### OEM Samsung Travel Charger + Detachable Micro USB Data Cable This product states it is OEM and I really doubt that fact . It did not work on any of the Samsung phones of any type for our family . I wasted money purchasing this product .
5 #### I love not having to tie the old bonnet to the buffer . AND it works with my orbital sander so I did n't have to adapt the buffer with the hook and loop strips . Plus my orbital sander has variable speed so I can slow down the orbiting so I 'm not too aggressive applying the wax around the decals on the RV .
3 #### Many audio enthusiasts -- or even " sound engineers"--may be overlooking the superior value in a tube microphone preamp with limiter settings ( but no presets ) . It 's the " non - V3 " ART Tube MP Studio Microphone Preamp and Limiter . In Amazon search box , simply insert : ART Tube MP Studio Mic Preamp This " non - V3 " model ( currently going for under 30 ) does n't have as many knobs , but it 's solidly built and has never failed me in the nearly 3 years I 've used it to provide phantom power for condenser mics or other power adjustments to mics that require them . The added " voicing " knob of the pictured model means more time - consuming tweaking with little change to the quality of the boosted sound . Moreover , with the absence of the extra , large knob on the " non - V3 " model , there are fewer possibilities of breakage of the instrument in an audio bag jammed with mics , cables , connectors , and other devices . Finally , the price of the " non - V3 " model is currently less than half that of the pictured model , with an extra knob that strikes me as more like a ten - dollar improvement ( assuming the user finds it an improvement ) .
5 #### Very nice quality speaker mic . PTT switch never fails like some of the cheaper mics . I have this for my radio and have purchased 2 of these for co workers . They look and feel like quality .
1 #### The pink leopard print started rubbing off on the first day and now it is just patches of white everywhere . I am not pleased with this product
2 #### Check and double check your carb numbers . This kit looked like it would work . However it was not the right one for the Holley 4 barrel on my Indmar 5.7L marine engine . I ended up only finding this out after I opened the package to start installing it . The blue gaskets would not line up with the bowls . No way to return it after opening .
2 #### First of all , this stand is not sturdy at all . I actually bent it a little just putting it together . I have a song book that really is n't very heavy . I put it on this stand , and now the shelf is crooked from the weight . Its very wobbly , and sometimes it falls when I change music . Do not recomend
4 #### I have been using this for close to a year . I looked and tried numerous products ( see my other reviews ) before settling on this product . I want an air vent mount instead of the windshield or dashboard type of mount , since I feel more secure knowing the speed we generally drive in . This product is mainly made of plastic , of reasonable quality . When trying to mount for the first time , heavy force should not be used as this would simply cause parts to be broken . The assembly itself does not require too much force . So caution should be taken if you find that you need to exert more force than necessary to assembly the parts together . The original spring clips that come with it , that connect the main assembly to the air vent , do not fit easily . I tried multiple methods and was unsuccessful . After calling Bracketron customer service , I was advised to try using the spring clip replacement , which is free and the request can be found on their website . With these spring clips , mounting to the air vent is a breeze and do offer secure assembly . I am able to fit my iPhone 4 with a casing , securely to this assembly . With the price , even though the mount is only available in portrait mode , I am overall happy with this product .
5 #### I love this product works just how I expected to work .. Dries my car faster than just using towels . So far I think it will last a while , made from good quality materials
5 #### This works very well in my 2008 Porsche Cayman . The actual coverage was very good and I was able to apply double layers to some areas such as the engine access cover and the firewall behind the seats . I saw a lot of reviews from people who were talking about buying 3 or even 8 of these boxes to do their vehicles , but I can not imaging using that much material . You do not need to have 100 % coverage with this and in my experience as long as you get at least a decent sized strip on a panel it will work . It does n't stink at all , sticks very well and goes on easily . If you like to cut your fingers then you should definitely not use gloves .
4 #### First let me say this works fine when connecting standard headphones to my HTC made " Verizon Wireless SMT5800 " ( model number LIBR100 ) , clear audio quality , I would say better then bluetooth stereo quality wise so no degradation of the signal . The first hitch is the size , my phone 's a couple inches long and this adapter effectively doubles the length . I really underestimated the size when looking at a picture but it 's manageable . Then it has a quirk where if you disconnect the headphones while the adapter is connected to the phone you have to unplug the adapter again or it wo n't read the headphones when you plug them back it , upon plugging them back in it triggers the voice command prompt for some reason , I am not sure if this is a problem with the adapter or with the windows mobile on my phone . Other then the above two notes this product works fine , ordered it so I could use my phone as a mp3 player on a upcoming flight since my bluetooth headphones would not be a option and I see no reason it will not work .
5 #### Like leaving the window cracked without the weather entering the vehicle .
5 #### Using this in my LG Dare cell phone . Write speed is fast and read speed is also good . Does what I need , not much to review on a product like this .
5 #### Nice capo , be sure to get either a curved or straight leg . Depends on your guitar .
5 #### The capo works well . I must be pretty weak though because it 's hard for me to put it on my guitar .
5 #### yep it 's a Belkin Hi - Speed USB 2.0 Cable ( 10 Feet ) not much you can say about it .... if our ordering it ' it works perfectly with an Arduino http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H06TVG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_4
1 #### This product is awful . It was ok when I installed it , but then it did n't even last long . Right after applying the screen protector , it immediately showed signs that the adhesive was n't strong enough . The edges were lifted and it allowed dust to get inside the protector . It could 've been great , but the adhesive was just useless . I guess that 's why it was only 98 cents .
5 #### Fits my oakleys , who would have guessed . Typical great overpriced Oakley product . Soft interior keeps the lenses from scratching and the full zipper keeps them from falling out . The formed ballistic nylon is very sturdy .
5 #### Power chair / scooter lift on the back on my truck has a pull out arm that make the whole thing tilt to the pull out side . It 's now level and has zero wobble . Took less than five minutes .
5 #### Cleans the leather of all stuff , even ink pen marks .
2 #### Noticed no difference in my truck , same humidity and scent . Absolutely no change , probably will not buy again .
4 #### It is my misfortune to live in a " fringe " FM reception area ; the station I regularly listen to is 75 miles away . I have tried various combination shortwave / AM / FM radios over the past few years and none had better than " so - so " sound on FM . I 'd read about this radio for many years and when I saw it on Amazon , figured it was worth a try . I have been very pleasantly surprised ! The radio is very large , but has very large speakers that , combined with separate bass and treble controls , produce a very good quality sound . The tuner section is highly sensitive , even on FM . After I loaded the six D cells into it , I have never even plugged it into the wall and it has been used daily for several hours for many months now . The build quality is a little cheesy , but if it were n't it would weigh as much as an anchor . If you want good quality audio and reception at a very reasonable price and do n't mind a large portable , this is a winner .
5 #### I received hubs quickly after ordering , Installation on my 2002 F250 was simple , instructions were good . I did stop by my local Napa and purchased some vaccum caps for lines to be disconnected . My only complaint is the hubs sit back in the hubcaps a good 3/4 " , does n't affect anything but looks , it would have been nice if they were flush with caps .
5 #### I had an Ibanez that came stock with the auto trim tuners and loved them . I wanted to replace the tuners on my Les Paul JR because it was having trouble staying in tune . I did n't know how expensive tuners can be . So I started looking for the auto trims and was happy to find that Planet Waves offered them , and on Amazon they were as much as 50 % lower in price than on any other site . I have had no tuning problems since putting these on , and the auto cut feature works perfect . I use .10-.46 on my electrics . At this price I will eventually get them on all 5 of my guitars . Instructions say to pull the string tight and tighten the locking screw . I have found that you need to leave some slack in the string or it will be in tune before it gets cut defeating the trim feature . I am surprised how well they work cuz it sure looks strange to see only 1/2 a wrap on the posts . Just be sure to tighten the lock screws good .
5 #### It holds all my acoustics perfectly . It 's light but stays in place okay . Rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like they 'll last a while . Two really nice things about this design : 1 ) it folds up very nicely and becomes pretty small , 2 ) the all black and slim arms / legs design makes it look nicer in a room . It pretty much disappears when you put a guitar on it so I 'm able to have it out without offending my wife . :)
5 #### My other radio is a Uniden Elite PC 78 and it stopped working . I noticed the mike wires had weathered and cracked from age and heat . So i purchased this radio for just a few dollars more than another radio . I just used the mike and my old radio , that had been peaked and tuned , worked like a charm . Now I have a spare radio when I need one .
5 #### the best string we used so far not a bad price for all you get would get another set when i need them
5 #### i recently ordered this ethernet cable due to mine being so old and long . this cable is the perfect size , works admirably and i received it within a week at a great price ! thx u so much ! as always i 'll continue to shop online at amazon in the future !
3 #### I tried to use it in my 2008 Ford Explorer factory CD changer . No luck . It would just spit it out when it got to the brush section . I know some others had said it worked for them in their car decks and changers , but sadly , it did not work for me . If anyone has any ideas or tips that might help it work , I 'm all ears .
5 #### I was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen ( 47 " LG ) onto the wall - what happens if it falls off ! After looking at mounts at Target and Best Buy that were $ 100 + , would this possibly work ? Fast forward ... The mount took about 20 minutes to install ( too longer to locate the studs than mount it ) . The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully . Very solid mount and good articulation . My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak . I will be replacing them with black cable ties . Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen ( tilt ) by about 1/4 " since there is only a screw on the bottom . Overall , I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20 " extension . Definitely would recommend for a TV that is 47 " .
4 #### All I have read about these was pretty much true . You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay , but they do come out with a little tug . A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though , and it peels off if necessary . But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop . And that 's huge , especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [ except an over the head headset ] seemed to work . All in all worth the cost easily . I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only . If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need .
3 #### Works but only for a while as it falls apart due to poor construction .
4 #### Bought to power my pedal board . Work great ! ! Would recommend to anybody . Dunlop is a quality company . Works great with my cry baby wah
5 #### hello folks i bought one of these Metro Vacuum B3 blowers to dry my motorcycle after washing.lots of small nooks and cranny 's that my large hands do not fit . there is a learning curve here for sure.at first i was making more of a mess of things.with water spots everywhere when i finished.after sometime you figure it out and people ask how you can keep your bike so clean.i tell them the air force blaster
4 #### Well , the cutter works . I used it as soon as I got the item to trim the ends of some nylon strings I had put on my classical guitar . I had ordered the winder because it finally dawned on me how tedious and time - consuming it was to hand - wind strings , especially since I change the strings more frequently on my current guitar . I play it more often than other guitars I 've had ( because I love my guitar ) and also because I 'm experimenting with different brands and tensions of strings . I did check and see if the winder would at least fit the pegs , and it does . It might take a minute or two to get the hang of the thing since it seems to " flop " around more than I realized . It also seems made of flimsy plastic ( but considering the price , I 'm not complaining ) . I keep it safe in the inner compartment of my guitar case . This brand was recommended to me by some other guitar players I asked . They said that a basic winder is all most people really need .
4 #### Great price on a motorcycle oil filter for my Honda VTX1800 . Everywhere else wanted $ 10 and up for them . But supposedly , Purolator PureOne is better . But I certainly can not tell .
5 #### Replaced a cheaper one I had , sqivel head comes in handy .
4 #### Not a great fit , but worked for breaking loose two crank bolts . 2007 Accord v6 and 2007 odyssey ( obviously v6 ) .
5 #### Great price , work as advertised . Used to transport a bicycle on a cross - country trip and it worked great . Pretty solid .
5 #### I have been using these strings for decades . They are great and not the most expensive . Package arrived on time and was as advertised .
5 #### Works great for extention on netbook , laptops w/o DVD / CD hardware . Portable from unit to unit . File sharing , video , music . Good price .
5 #### Guitar was worth the money it plays well right out of the box . A great guitar for the money , Thanks !
5 #### Accurate description , looks great and works great , just what I needed . Smooth accurate operation .
5 #### Takes seconds to set up and works amazingly well . Product is durable , reliable , and Netgear guarantees their ProSafe line for a lifetime .
4 #### They sound good , I replaced epi classic pro 's and they are clearer and sound better but I expected them to be much better , they are nicer but I 'm not sure by how much .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Ernie 's . I think their electric strings last longer than others , have better sustain , and stay in tune better than other brands . Just my .02
4 #### This capo is very all - around cap . It 's made well , and I like this basic design because it 's very easy and quick to use . I 've used lots and lots and lots of different capos over 45 or so years of playing , and this Dunlop capo has never failed me . I would have rated it five stars , but I do have just one other brand that I like a bit more . Bottom line : From my experience , ca n't go wrong with this model capo .
5 #### I USE THIS IN MY KITCHEN AND IT SOUNDS MUCH BETTER THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A SMALL RADIO . MY HUSBAND WAS SKEPTICAL BUT EVEN HE LIKES IT NOW ! IT RECEIVES MORE STATIONS THAN MOST SMALL RADIOS I HAVE OWNED .
5 #### I was having an issue with some trippy noise that sounded like I could hear my computer processing . I heard a crazy weird high pitch beep , scratching , screeching noise in my studio monitors / speakers when I moved around windows , opened programs , listened to music , during making music , and even at boot up . It went interface out to studio monitors - my 2.0 usb interface was plugged into a 3.0 usb slot I heard the noise even when my interface did n't have power just the USB to the motherboard . I thought it was my PC , USB slots , interface , monitors . I was buying new gear and swapping stuff out . Anyways I bought 3 of these probably only needed 2 but hey worth the peace of mind . Wanted to post this for anyone else having this issue - hope you come across this and it fixes your problem ! !
5 #### Mounted next to my Blue Sea dual USB Port for more charging options . Easy install and delivers as promised . Great value for the money !
5 #### I travel by air frequently and game with my phone so there 's never enough battery to last through a trip ... until now ! I went internet surfing for an extra phone battery and found this on Amazon . This little unit ( it 's smaller than the phone ) packs a ton of extra energy . It comes with all the hook - ups you could possibly want to charge it and then hook it up to your phone . The amount of charge in the unit is huge ! so that you do n't have to recharge it every time you use it . When I use it to charge / run my phone while I 'm gaming , I hook it up and then just hold it in the same hand just tucked underneath my phone . It works very well .
5 #### This works just fine to connect printer to desktop . The price was right at about $ 5 , cheaper than anywhere else .
5 #### This is an excellent product for cleaning especially white cars after winter . I highly recommend this product .
1 #### These are sold as " over the ear " headphones . They sit heavily on top of the ears , not over them . They begin to hurt after a just few minutes . Totally uncomfortable . No comment on audio quality , as what use are headphones that are unusable ? I did read prior reviews , and these were well rated , but I do n't understand how other users can ignore the discomfort .
3 #### Less high frequency response than my Motorola S9 's . Difficult pairing with HTC Touch -- have to go to settings - each time to refresh unit as Wireless stereo and wireless handset . A pain ! Fits well . Light - great for exercising . Do n't get in the way .
5 #### The real deal . Wonderful mini amp you can record with if needed . The legend is actually true ; as long as you have a volume pot on your axe this will get you an awesome sound . Its battery operated and so portable you can walk around with it if needed . This is awesome for blues and rock , metal kids please stay away , you 'll be sorely disappointed .
5 #### Well I am glad I waited for an mp3 player because this puppy looks phat . It has 6 gb internal hd that holds roughly 100 hours of music . So you can now make the ultimate mix to accompany you in your life . The internal recorder also sounds sweet with on the spot WMA recording . Bootlegs anyone ? I can not wait until I get my hands on mine hopefully they are still around and cost the same by the time my Nov birthday rolls around . You need windows 98 or higher to run the software so if there was ever a reason to finally upgrade from ' 95 this is it . Apperently the unit takes about 30 secs to warm up and the batteries last around 4 hours per charge but it comes with two sets so rock on . Must stop looking at Nomad Jukebox on the little picture and just buy the sucka
5 #### These two charcoal packs were the only thing in this order .
5 #### Nice professional stage view . Good invention . So far its holding up pretty good .
4 #### I like this string winder , and it is convenient having the wire cutter there too , but the " bridge pin puller " is too small , and does n't work on my instruments . That 's why I gave it 4 stars instead of five .
5 #### it arrived within the time it said and was well packaged too ... its easy to install if you ve done it before .. if not watch a youtube videos on it under { replacing iphone 3gs screen} .... good luck ... thank you guys
5 #### Perfect fit on 2002 Ford Ranger . Color coding marched perfect to my Kenwood stereo and I had it wired up in about 5 minutes . What else could you ask for ?
4 #### I 've owned Pods for two previous Blackberry Pearls ( 8100,8120 ) and like it 's look and functionality . The only complaint I have is that I ca n't use the Charging Pod unless I remove the Gel Skin . I should n't have to remove the skin to charge my Blackberry . Why are n't the manufacturers of both products listening to their customers and making the necessary changes ?
5 #### I bought these for my Chauvet lights . They work just great , are easy to attach to your lights and are built tough . If you have a bunch of lights on your light stand , these will definitely make your setup and teardowns much faster !
5 #### Better than the circle ones in my opinion . That said , they are still a bit small to see the passenger side . Would buy again . Looks nicer and easier to see than the circle ones .
4 #### It 's better than the Boss . Still has some issues . Preloaded maps are out of date . Cost $ 70 to update . I would just buy a better one next time and not put up with the little issues .
2 #### This screen protector made it too difficult to see the screen in daylight . My son uses his phone when he runs and he found it to cause the screen to be too dark in the morning sun .
1 #### Piece of junk . Never held a charge . In my case My Mother whom I ordered it for did not tell me before the " 30 days " to catch them selling non - working batteries was up . Use it right away and often and expect to more than likely need to return it . Many warned on here but I tried it and got burned as well . Never did work .
5 #### stands up to my cat playing with it ! No deterioration in sound quality and the adaptors cover every device out there
4 #### These wiper blades function very well . No streaks , no skipping , and the silicone not only leaves a water replant film on the glass but lasts much longer than standard rubber . The frames are also good quality with a quality powder coat finish . Over all a very good product , except that I noticed some noise when the glass is n't getting a steady shower of water and/or as it 's barely wet . While wet or getting a shower there is no noise . Given this though I 'd still buy them again due to the other good things about it and the price .
5 #### As a beginner guitarist , a few friends let me try out their picks . I was displeased with most of the standard picks , partially because I did n't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just did n't sound quite as robust as I like ( hopefully , that makes sense ) . However , when I was handed one of these , it produced a pleasant sound and I did n't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing . Needless to say , now that I have my own guitar , I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed .
5 #### I am very satisfied with this product . I am going to order more in different colors
5 #### The Olympus D-340R is , in my opinion , the best value digital camera available right now . The picture quality is impressive --- I usually ca n't tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken with a $ 340 SLR that I have scanned in . Also , the camera is fairly lightweight and compact and easy to use , like a good point and shoot camera should be . Since I bought my Olympus , I have not taken 1 non - digital photograph . I enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from developing and film costs ( some $ 10 / roll ) . Overall , the camera is worth the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital photography .
5 #### Great SSD . Used this so install windows 10 on my Acer C720 Chromebook . Works fantastic .
3 #### The leather holster is ellegant , slim , and light . I like th product . I think the product could be even better if it had a magnet instead of velcro for closing it .
5 #### The color is very pretty and has lots of bling . This really fits my phone nice and I have got a lot of compliments on this .
5 #### I purchased this item for dusting on my Harley . It easily gets into hard to reach areas to keep them dust free . I also have used it for dusting in my automobile where it works well . I would recommend this product to all my friends . I do own the full sized California Duster for exterior dusting and the full size interior duster . They all work perfectly .
5 #### What more can you say . It works great on my wife 's S4 . She likes to keep all the pictures of the grandkids on the phone . 8 gb lets her do that with plenty of room to spare .
3 #### Yeah it 's a sim card and well my phone does n't have 3 G so I do n't really care that it works with 3 G because it does n't matter . I do n't know why they want reviews on sim cards . I find SIM cards outdated though , They are massive compared to Micro SD cards and yet they hold next to no information when compared . The only reason SIM cards are good is because they go in GSM phones and if you unlock your phone you can cart it off to another service provider without issue . Especially quad band phones .
3 #### My preference is to use the standard way of head tensioning . The Drum Dial works , but you still have to tweak the tuning and it really takes a while to get all of the lugs the same . I do n't like how the heads get scratched from this device and the snare head gets " dents " and " crop circles " . A lot of drummers like this device and that is great , but it is not for me .
3 #### Clean top end . Lacks in the low end . Sounds more like a built - in Peizo contact mic . I recommend the Dean Markley ProMag series .
4 #### It was n't a perfect fix but it was a huge improvement from its original form . Very satisfied with this product .
4 #### Easy to apply , seems to work well ( though I 've had it on for only about 3 weeks , so far . ) When applying , it is probably a good idea to put painters tape ( easily removable ) on any adjacent painted surfaces , to catch the over - spray .
5 #### great for your desk so you can see your phone at all times .
2 #### Despite the numerous positive reviews , I found these head - phones lacking on almost every level . The build quality seems cheap ( or rather , it seems appropriate for a $ 20 pair of headphones ) , and the sound was not overly impressive . It sounded fine , but what does that really mean ? The style seems cooler online , once you 're holding them they just look outdated . Not retro - vintage - chic , just old . Returned .
5 #### very sturdy , high quality with little to no feedback , i use it for performing for my friends and they all love it
5 #### This severs its purpose ... If you are like me then these things are just for you
1 #### I did n't like it as they must of been seconds as the backs ripped out right away and I ca n't use them and I guess that 's why they were so cheap ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I used these to solve the ( apparently endemic ) dilemma of incessant string breakage on a Babicz 6 - point Strat bridge . They solved it , all right- I am bending thirds and working the bar with complete confidence . They also warmed up the tone a bit on a very bright guitar . Highly recommended .
4 #### Use the highest quality epoxy glue you can find .. I used a glue that came in a plunger application that mixes epoxy and hardener as its squeezed out . The mirror itself does the job . It 's smaller than the mirror it replaced , I probably would have gone with the 10 " mirror had I known better . All in all , it keeps me from backing into things .
5 #### This is a great buy , compared to a $ 60 or more a retail store .
4 #### Same review from me as for the Case Logic Cable Ties . These are fine , but because they 're only grippy on about an inch at the end , they really only work well on larger cables , like power cords and ethernet cables , etc . I wanted them to wrap up all the little headphone and micro usb cables that I have cluttering my backpack . And these definitely are not good for those size cables . The colors are nice and will help you corral cables at your desk .
5 #### This is a perfect item for various cellphones ..... I highly recommend this product . And , it is stylish and reasonably priced and durable .
3 #### This mount is incompatable with any radios that have motorized faceplates or screens . You will have to install without the metal sleeve and insert the radio from the back . My radio ( Dual XDM7615 ) has a motorized faceplate that slides down to view the LED display and insert CD 's . I would have to cut up the bottom portion of this mount to make room for the faceplate to swing out . The side mounts are flimsy plastic that I do n't believe will last very long . If your radio has no moving parts using that mount will look like a factory install .
5 #### Definitely worth the money . Thick construction . Load with a grease gun or bulk.this really is a great product.just push the bearing down until great comes out the top ! Done !
5 #### Sure , aftermarket angle finders are available , but one can not beat Canon quality . Good optics and construction . In this case one gets what they pay for .
5 #### I was looking for something to hold my Alesis drum machine , power supply and its cables . This works great . I really like that not only does the bottom and surrounds have foam but so does the top or lid . Some bags skimp on that part so that is what makes it a winner for me . Check before you buy ! It is very sturdy and the " right size " so I 'm carrying giant half empty gear bags . This bag would also work for a tablet or netbook . Great form factor so check it out .
5 #### Sturdy and simple . Yolk width can be ( safely ) bent to accommodate classical guitars and yukes . Of note , yolk screws into mount and I 'm concerned that it might get damaged if I over - tighten it , so the yolk ends up not always staying level ...
5 #### These headphones are extremely cheap and the sound produced is excellent . Panasonic is a brand that one can certainly trust . The bass produced by these headphones is excellent .
5 #### Great item at a reasonable price , great delivery , great source I would recommend and or purchase items again .
5 #### Fit perfect works great on my Yard man mower that has Briggs & Stratton 18hp engine
2 #### After upgrading to all Gigabit networking , I ended up using this router as a small local router for my Tivo . It was fine for several years and then it just died a few days ago . Only port 5 shows activity any longer - ports 1 - 4 are dead . I 've never had a router fail like this before ( and I have 5 in my current home network in various places all over the house ) . I was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage - it was pumping out 10.6v under no load and 9.5v when connected to the Linksys . That 's 26 % over the proper voltage ( 7.5v ) ! It 's quite possible that over - powering the unit during it 's lifetime would have shortened its life .
5 #### This thing is one of the best camera thingys I 've bought yet ... for under $ 20 no less ! Long exposures , I ca n't wait . Night shots , here we go . Tripod and remove switch in hand , I 'm ready for bear !
1 #### I received this headset and it was defective . Not a big deal , but customer service is horrible ! They sent me the wrong replacement unit , and argued with me about it . After spending an hour and a half on the phone , having to call back twice due to being hung up on , They finally decided to send me another piece out . So , here it is two weeks later , I do n't have what I bought , and I still have to do all the shipping , and follow up calls ! I 've talked to at least 6 people , and they all have different " facts " about the same product . They just do n't know ... Maybe if they were from this country ... ? Continued ! On # 3 , and they are all crap ! This one the speaker is all crackly at any volume that is loud enough to hear , and the green led(charge indicator ) does n't work ! I do n't know how Motorola can possibly function with this quality ! ? ! ? ! I do n't usually do bad reviews , but this has been the most miserable purchase that I 've ever made ! ! ! If you decide to buy one , I truly hope that you 'll have better luck ... I will not buy Motorola again~(hopefully I will always have another choice ... )
3 #### I 've owned the Audio Technica Pro 88W for five months and used it in a wide variety of professional videography applications . Here are a few important things I 've noticed : 1 . It works very well within twenty feet of your subject , provided that you have a clear view of that person . In other words it does n't work well around corners , or even with other people standing between you and your subject . 2 . It does not function well at all in a busy convention center atmosphere . I just returned from a convention in Orlando where there were as many as fifty other wireless systems being used , and the Pro 88W system was almost completely useless . I had to resort to running a 12 ' cable to my spokemodel 's microphone . Having more than just two channels may have helped this situation . Certainly the Pro 88 is a good value . It 's constructed very well . I 'm happy that it uses 3.5 mm connections , ( the same as my Canon DSLR ) and requires a 9 volt battery , which are my favorite power source . However in my case I am going to have to upgrade to a more expensive UHF system . Sincerely - Robert Marcos
3 #### This was a bit wobbly . Still have n't found a solution but other wise it 's ok . It does the job
5 #### Great product with nice feel and tone . I 'm only sorry I pre - ordered only two sets at $ 12.49 . The average price now is $ 15 and over . I 'll bite the bullet and order more after I wear these two sets out . Hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time I need new strings . These are durable and long lasting . Recommeded .
3 #### Wipes great , but there 's slop in the linkage where it attaches to the wiper arm , so they skip a bit sometimes due to this . I had some parts from my old wipers that I used to fix the problem .
5 #### I 've used this product for years . It is a high quality , long lasting protectant . It is not to shiny like most of these type of products out there .
5 #### This item fit and worked perfectly ! It had a complete diagram to work with the existing Jeep Harness . I would recommended .
5 #### This looks awesome on our motorhome and fit to a tee !
4 #### Works as disclosed . I have no complaints and use it frequently .
4 #### Get the stabilizer one if you are over 55 and they should have included the pop out cups to cover eye socket ( reduces side light ) in the design . Crystal clear .
5 #### I do a cabaret show and unfortunately can not use a pianist , so I use tracks . I have a nice sound system , but have such an odd space that I can not control the sound of the tracks that come out of my iPod and/or iPad . So I bought the product for the iPod and it worked so well I bought a second for my iPad so I would n't have to unplug for a different song if it happened to be on the other device .
3 #### Bought this product thinking it would be pretty much all I needed for keeping my interior surfaces and window clean but I was wrong . The glass cleaner says " no streaks " but I have them everywhere and it irritates me when I drive . The interior wipes suck and leave white pieces everywhere . On top of all that these are expensive and I have to use so many to clean all my windows and they dry out super quick . If your in a hurry to pick up a girl and want your car to look decent these will do a bang up job but will get it done . Only reason I rated 3 stars instead of 2 is because I love armor all products but this one let me down .
1 #### False advertising as to ' approved ' listed products . This did not fit my Dell laptop , and I still have to pay for shipping when they lie on what this will attach to ? I 'll never buy a kensington product again and will steer people clear of them as well . Complete bull$#!% .
5 #### I thought it might bond a little more solid than it does , still an excellent product
4 #### They work fine . A little lighter than I expected but that can be a benefit as well . I have a favorite that is a little larger and heavier then these that I am attached to .
5 #### This is a great set of headphones . I love the very bassy response . The trebles and mids are nice too . It is did n't pull my hair it would be perfect , but I do n't find that too problematic so I left all 5 stars . I have had headphones that cost $ 200 and I have traded those on Craigslist . This set is a keeper for its great sound , lifetime warranty , and portability . Its been around for years . There 's a reason that its a classic .
5 #### El proceso realizado sin ningun problema , la entrega fue realizada a plena satisfaccin , durante el tiempo establecido , se recomienda el vendedor
2 #### Phone is not very " User Friendly " . Stylus requirement is a challenge . Sprint stores do not sell a replacement Stylus , and neither do CompUSA or Best Buy . Memory card must be purchased separately . Price is way too high .
3 #### Microphone jack never seemed to plug in correctly , causing a loss in audio . Was fixed by loosing the jack slightly , but that 's just silly to leave it unplugged a quarter of the day into the port .
5 #### So far this product has lived up to my expectations . This is my first BT . I do n't use it as avidly as some might ( 2 -3 times / week ) , but it has held its charge since I 've received it ( about 2 weeks now ) . Great sound . Easy to use . Paired with my Pantech Matrix easily .
4 #### The tripod is pretty decent for its price . It has everything I expected . It is light , easy to fold and unfold . I 've been using it for a while and found that although it seem fragile , it has not been damaged as yet . The only issue I have with it is that it 's a bit bulky to carry . But I guess that is expected from a 5 ' tripod . It comes with a nylon carrying bag that you can sling over your back . The strap is not adjustable though . It does what I want it to do , so I 'm satisfied .
5 #### This is a very nice case at a fair price , very good protection and the guitar fits perfectly . All pretty standard features of a guitar case and it 's exactly what I was looking for . It is a really good deal ! ! !
1 #### This looked like an interesting and relatively low - cost option for my wife 's car / cell phone , since she has n't found a bluetooth headset that fits her ear comfortably . Unfortunately , we can not get this unit to pair with any of three cell phones ( iPhone 3 G , two new Nokias ) . It goes into pairing mode as advertised , but none of our phones can find it ( they all find all of the headsets and computers we have tried pairing with other than this unit ) . Makes this rather useless , and I would strongly suggest testing your phone against one of these before ordering . Also disappointed in the lack of a USB or AC charger . My fault for not noticing that this only comes with a car charger - not very convenient for how we typically charge . No issues with the merchant - quickly shipped and delivered just fine . The low rating here is about the speakerphone , not the merchant .
4 #### Excellent price for a non audiophile . For me , sound is great and isolation is too . Nice snug fit . They tend to wiggle a but lose when I run so I use a headband to help hold them in . This works because they are so small and the headband does n't make it feel like a vise .
4 #### Pros : - This rubbing compound does a great job working through tough oxidized paint - The tub gives you a lot of product , easily enough for 4 - 6 complete car jobs - Works great with hand application and rotary buffer Cons : - If you let any compound dry on any car panels or glass for too long , it takes a lot of elbow grease to remove . Because the polish is red , it leaves very noticeable splatter - Compound is a paste , so it does dry much faster than its liquid equivalents Overall , this product is a great value . You ca n't beat the price and it does its job well so long as you cover up any parts of the car you are n't working on and you are quick to clean up after any splatter as it happens . It 's also important to know that this rubbing compound will not give you a mirror finish . It 's made gritty enough to help remove oxidation , deeper clear coat scratches , and overspray . You should be sure to follow this up with a finer polishing compound in order to restore your car paint back to factory condition .
5 #### Works as advertised Would like to see a little longer chord .
2 #### When looking at these products , simply calculate the actual cost per square foot . for example this"speaker kit " contains 1.38 square feet , for around 22 bucks(price fluxuates like its a stock or something?)can u think of anything that s worth 15 dollars a square foot ? there are so many cheaper alternatives . dynamat is an awsome product , and it does work . but for those of us not made of money , search this " butyl flashing tape " u will be glad u did .
4 #### I purchased this item for use with a variety of video chat / conferencing software applications . No special drivers were required for my Mac ( OS X 10.7.x ) and the sound output quality is SUPERB . FAR exceeds what I expected from such an affordable USB speakerphone . No tinny - ness or vibrations , rather clean highs and impressive mids / lows for such a small device . I have n't tested it with any conferencing software , so I 'll update my post once I use it as intended .
2 #### the clearance between the tools is to tight and I would not allow me to turn strut nut until I ground strut holding tool down . It did accomplish the job for not much money . you get what you pay for .
5 #### My daughter loves these shoe box type recorders and they are hard to find . This is exactly what she was looking for .
5 #### I had these headphones since around 2000 , its been so long ago . I work as digital artist , so these headphones are being used 30 hours a week for the past 13 years . They still work as good as the day I got them . I have dropped these headphones countless of times and there is little to no damage . The only thing I had to replace is the earpiece as they become flaky after years of use . I would recommend these to any who wants a great set of headphones and do n't want to pay overrated high price for some others . There must be a reason why people are still buying the MDR - V6 that have not been discontinued yet . Really a great set of headphones .
3 #### This carrying case is good as a clip - on case for hauling the GPS on hikes , bike rides , canoe trips , etc . It clips firmly to belts , straps , etc . , and does protect the unit from most kinds of hazards . The case , however , makes the GPS ' display relatively difficult to read . It also interferes with the USB cable connection and has to be at least partially removed to connect the GPS to a computer . The case fits rather snugly , so it 's mildly inconvenient to take it off , even partially . The GPS ' carry strap attaches to the bottom of the unit , which goes into this case first . That means the strap has to be routed along the side of the GPS and out from the case , which is clumsy , and can interfere somewhat with the side buttons . Since I mainly use the GPS as a tracking device for later viewing on maps , these problems are fairly minor . But , when I use the device for navigation , the case can be a significant problem .
4 #### The kit got everything you need in a small travel size case . It got all the colors I need . The only thing you need to be aware of , if you are a latina the liquid make - up will make you look too pale .
5 #### A little small for my hands to work the clips and crimps need to be re - crimped but worth the price
5 #### Works as advertised for my Tim Armstrong Hellcat 12 string guitar . I find it reliable and cost effective . Kyser regularly delivers quality and here is no exception .
4 #### This mount is sturdy ( I have a 32 inch LCD TV , it only weighs 11 lbs , but I 'm pretty sure the mount weighs more ... ) . Installation was easy , all the parts and hardware that we needed ( and did n't need ! ) were in the box . We had it up in very little time . It 's great . One person could hang it alone , but two makes it much easier . It has multiple points that you can level the television , so it does n't necessarily need to be perfectly level ( the installation person for me got it right ) . There is no list , and it holds position really well .
4 #### It 's survived my clumsiness and I can load it with 4 pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat .
5 #### Gives us more confidence that we are taking good care of our recently rebuilt TH350 .
5 #### Was concerned about the Nook falling off the tabs but it 's all good the Oliver Cover is a sturdy little covering nothing " fancy " no extra pockets or other dohickeys just a plain jane sturdy Nook Book cover I 'm very pleased . I 've read other reviews with complaints about " it should have a clasp " to hold it shut , I do n't find that to be an issue but I also do n't carry my Nook around with me everywhere I go as I have a life so boo hoo for no clasp . Thanks and enjoy your new Nook Book Cover .
1 #### There 's no such thing as a " Glasspack Muffler " . A Muffler is designed to quiet your Exhaust , to a LEGAL decibel level . A Glasspack is designed to Barely do anything at all . Glasspacks are not Mufflers , and Mufflers are not Glasspacks . I have repeatedly told Amazon about this issue , but they refuse to change their ways , and ensure a " Tell The Truth " policy .
5 #### I use only 100 % synthetic fluids for my 1990 Toyota Camry which I keep in mint condition since the day I bought it new in 1990 . Mobil 1 Extended Performance motor oil . Royal Purple Max ATF Synthetic automatic transmission fluid , Royal Purple fully synthetic Power Steering fluid and Toyota 50/50 Anti - Freeze coolant . I wo n't give a lesson on why synthetic fluids are far superior to conventional fluids . I 've had that argument WAY before auto manufacturers started REQUIRING synthetic fluids right from the factory . They are far superior . In the case of this brake fluid . I 've compared all the spec . sheets on all the major brake fluids , and this one meets the highest standards . I just keep is simple with fluids and follow two rules . Change EVERY fluid on your vehicle yearly ( more often n the case of the motor oil depending how much you drive ) and use the BEST fluids available . THIS is the best brake fluid available .
5 #### Used to connect a HD video camera that used a mini - HDMI connection . This worked as expected and I have n't had any problems with it .
4 #### Remover seems to be universal . Could n't have removed my 2007 Impala power steering without this great heavy duty removal tool . But the installer tool does n't fit . Luckily my new ac delco pump came with the correct installer .
4 #### This armband does exactly as it was designed and intended to do . I go running several times a week wearing this band with my iPhone and at stays in place . The only thing I do n't like about this is that the strap is a little short for my liking . I 'm not a big guy at 5 ' 8 " and my arm is probably a little bigger than average due to weight lifting , but this strap is just long enough for me to use . Any of you bigger guys should be wary of purchasing this .
3 #### They do their job , but I found the touch screen to be less sensitive . I ended up taking mine off and going back to just the iPhone screen .
5 #### As good a manual grease gun as you can buy . I expect it to last me a lifetime .
4 #### Decent humidifier but dries out pretty quickly so you need to keep the sponge inside moist often by running it under some water .
5 #### Got an OEM LG charger when I ordered here . Worked nicely , coils up well also .
2 #### I 'd like to review this product for its efficacy on cleaning my brakes , but unfortunately my can came without a nozzle extension . Given that I 'd rather not spray this all over the side of my wheel and tire ( there 's a reason they include a nozzle , as I 'm sure this is pretty bad for rubber and paint ) I have no idea if this works as well as they say it does . But I can say their quality control needs to be improved ...
3 #### When you are in a quiet room you can make out what people are saying , Hey two way radios are n't crystal clear . However , this product seems to exaggerate an already prevalent problem . If you are in a crowd , do n't bother using the headset , it simply does n't work well .
5 #### Used these for a previous wireless phone that one of my granddaughters had at the time . It worked as well as the original .
3 #### It seems to be a limited device , but it has potential I think a good price it new should be about $ 55.00 . I have one as a backup to my kindle P.W there are two pros , the SD card slot and it can be rooted , but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted . Very very limited web browser no Facebook or anything useful , the browser on the the paperwhite is much better . It is a pretty well made device . It is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite .
5 #### Works great , nice to have the printer away from the PC on the desk . Gives me more room on my desk .
5 #### I ca n't tell you how many replacement chargers I 've ordered that were supposedly OEM and just failed . We have 6 different phones in our family that all use the micro- chargers and this one is wonderful . The cord is nice and long and it works perfectly on every phone . I 've ordered three of them to leave around the house for everyone to use .
5 #### I see why now how kyser sells so many of these , easy to use , clamps down tight , and a nice looking capo in this finish
5 #### Genuine Canon , not a cheap imitation . Comes properly packaged and the price was the best . Replacement for the 7D and 5D eye cups .
5 #### I was anxious about buying a battery sight unseen . I chose this battery based on its matching the dead one & customer feedback for BTO . I placed the order late on a Friday night ; it was in my mailbox Thursday morning . The product arrived the first day of estimated arrival ; so relieved ! Easy installation ; took around an hour to charge the battery initially , and I 've got my phone back and all the power I need ! So happy I do n't have to replace the entire phone . I highly recommend this product !
5 #### Sure these headphones look a bit wierd . A matter of taste at best . However the sound is great ! Whether the source is a smartphone , tablet or PC this is an excellent sounding headphone for the price .
5 #### Ever wanted headphones that are perfectly flat through the vast majority of the audible range ? Here you go . These do n't have much bass hump or treble rolloff , they are not for comfortable , everyday listening . These are for when you want to hear every last element of the mix , and any bit of distortion . And I find in general that music that I mix using these things comes out sounding excellent on everything from laptop speakers to big , bassy speaker systems . Anything harsh sounding , little bits of distortion , etc . will pop out to you on these things . You will need powerful hardware to drive these things , and they 're quite sensitive to background noise . Not for laptop or phone listeners .
4 #### Nice winder / cutter / pin puller . My only issue is the squeaking when turning the tuning pegs . Can get annoying when stringing up at a gig .
5 #### still playing this item everyday , no problems with down loading and no problems with the sound ... great price
4 #### Solid product - works just as stated . Lack of stereo could pose a problem for some , but was expected .
5 #### Fits great keeps most of the crap out of the carpet
2 #### I 've been trying to find a decent A / B switch for awhile to switch between my tube amp and pod rig . Unfortunately , this one did not fit the bill . The switches are too close together , and worse , whichever channel is off still gets signal from the other channel - it bleeds . It does not seem to suck tone at least , even when both channels are on ( ' Y ' mode ) but if you use this for ' A ' OR ' B ' the off channel will get signal bleed . So in my case , when my clean pod is ON ( A is selected ) , the distorted amp which should be OFF ( B ) but still bleeds through , ruining the clean tone . Also , no 9v adapter - had to use a battery eliminator cable(not included ) . Fed up with these lousy A / B products - ordered a loop master .
5 #### This puppy is a piece of art + machine all in one . The miniature size and high quality production materials make this product a thing to put on a pedestal . But what do you care if it does n't perform ? Well it does just great in all sorts of light conditions . I 've taken it to Washington State where the sun do n't shine too brightly with Fuji 200ASA - great panoramic shots with good color . After 6 months with this camera - I have n't used my 35 mm Olympus . However , those of you who are really into detail will find the Advanced film quality slightly unacceptable . The controls are just fabulous - the best is the zoom lever - immediate zoom speed without a lot of time lapse . The actual zoom ratio is n't that great but you have to give up something for its size . It 's got all the standard red - eye , fill - in , timer functions , plus a bunch of nifty time - date - stamp buttons . The back display gives you all the info in logical layout . The only thing you need to watch out for is the standard 2 - step focus and shoot process . Because this gem is so small , it 's easy to move the camera while trying to get a good shot . And if you 're thinking about the Elph 1 versus Elph 2 - I 've seen 2 of the Elph 1 's in the camera shop with its flash stuck in the up mode .
5 #### Nice product to hide those unsightly wires . Looks great painted . Easy application .
5 #### Works like a charm to protect plastic parts on the car . Top quality just like all Lexol products .
5 #### Pros : It works , I use my storm as my alarm clock now . The storm fits snugly into the device . I 've even seen pictures where a person had this in their car , but it takes some DIY skills . Cons : You wo n't be able to use it if you have your storm in a case . Other Thoughts : I wish it had a headphone jack then I could use it as a bedside MP3 player . You can still access the jack on the phone but it would be nice if it was in the dock .
4 #### These have good tone , but I ca n't see much of a difference over other brands at the same price point . I initially experienced buzzing after the string change with these but I needed to adjust the truss rod . Came in a timely manner from Sam Ash . Thanks !
4 #### The Rio 500 is a great MP3 player . It has all the features I wanted , pretty good battery life , and is a perfect size . PROS : -Basic , easy to use interface . -Decent battery life , although not as long as the manufacturer claims . CONS : -I hate the software interface . It is slow , unstable and poorly designed . I suggest you use Windows Media Player instead to upload files to the device . -As of firmware version 2.15 ( availible from ftp://ftp.s3.com/pub/multimedia/rio/rio500_firmware_215.exe ) , the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to 64 mb , to give it 128 mb of total memory . Although this is a decent amount , 128 mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaper .... -There is no Windows XP support with the included software . It will work with XP using 3rd party software , which , consequently , is better than the included software ...
5 #### I have been plagued with very dirty power for years . After doing a great deal of research , as I would suggest anyone do before buying almost anything , I settled on The Monster MP HT800 . I 'm using it mainly for audio recording , Voice Over work to be exact , where a clean signal is a must . Hooked up my computer , mixing board and amp to this , and right away , the low frequency hum , I 've had to pad out , went away . Bought two now , and in the crowded urban environment of LA , I finally have clean sounding power . This is no hype , just the facts . I know some reviewers do n't notice a difference , well they probably have less noise to filter out . Hope the surge protection is as good as the filtering . Price was right on Amazon as well . I think I 'll get a third for the home theater .
1 #### It did n't work well at all . Everything we plugged in with it flickered like the electricity was not steady .
5 #### it works . pretty straight forward , did n't take long to arrive ( about a week ) i m pretty sure i m the only one buying zune accessories so i do n't anticipate this review helping anyone
5 #### It gives you a nice angle for mic placement . Excellent for recordings
4 #### It 's a very good quality product . But not for me . It somehow added some thickness to the stick . I tried it few times but went back to clear sticks right away . One alternative : sand the sticks where you hold them . It helps during shows .
2 #### This is the second time I 've purchased this item the first time was from a store the sold refurbished products the cord worked fine for a week then I had intermittent problems on the right ear cup , then the left cup went completely dead . The ones I got from Amazon as soon as I plugged them in there were problems some sounds were coming through others not at all . The volume had to set very high to hear anything at all . Maybe I was just unlucky twice but I do n't intend to be unlucky three times . I brought another cable from Amazon that works just fine ; I gave up some of the length but in the end it worked out .
1 #### The double back tape did not hold and it fell off in a few days . Good news is it fell off in my driveway .
3 #### The gun looks to be constructed OK for the price and it loaded easily . However , the coupler on mine came broken . I have contacted the manufacturer through their website to see if I can get a replacement . If they send me one without a hassle , I 'm assuming this will work OK . I 'll just have to wait and see .
5 #### First of all , I 'm no expert . I 've only been playing for a few years . One of my guitar instructors encouraged using thicker picks . After trying many pick types , these are my favorite . I use these with both acoustic and electric . I like the sound , and they never fall out of my hand . For some reason other types do n't stick to my fingers as well .
5 #### Awesome winch . Installed on a trailer that hauls scissor lifts and fork lifts , and this thing can drag almost anything on to the trailer , even with the wheels locked up .
4 #### I placed my order on Jan 4th from Seller1ON1 . I received it today ( 9th ) . The Snap - on Protector Hard Case Image Cover " Artistic Purple Flowers " Design " for Apple iPhone 4 & 4S did not come as shown in the picture . In the picture It cover the top speaker as well as , the bottom , but the one I received does not have that . In the picture its white case with design , the one I received is gray with the design . I KNOW I SHOULD B DISAPPOINTED RIGHT , but I like the one I received looks better than the one in the picture , so it worked out for me .
2 #### Just another plastic case , would not recommend if you 're looking for real protection .
1 #### The discription sounded good but after I bought it and put it to use , I found it to be " not as advertised " and returned it .
5 #### Was recommended by a great mechanic and is less expensive here than at my local auto supply store when they had it on sale .
5 #### A Beacon in the Night . Great for night driving- I prefer the Ion plasma yellow tint though- The super bright white of these bulbs reflect back at you during snow or whiteout conditions . If you want a simple clear white light , these are it- If you 'll be driving in any snowy , fog or whiteout conditions , take a peak at the PIAA Ion plasma
5 #### Makes angry noise loud . I love it . Few options , but the combination of tone / dist and options on the amp work fine .
3 #### Great guitar companies do n't always make ( or sell under their aegis ) the best strings . I love my Teles but I ca n't stand Fender strings . Likewise , I love my Martin ukulele , but trying these strings for the second time , I had the same conclusion as I did the first ; Aquila 's are far better . Aquila 's have a more organic feel and a fuller , richer sound . The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner - Aquila 's take a couple of days or more - but the sound is thinner and the feel is n't nearly as friendly . The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not , for me , worth the lesser satisfaction , even on my least expensive ukes . Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings , the higher - priced Aquila 's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks . Use the Martin 's ( or any cheaper string ) when you are working on your uke , put the stress of repeatedly de - tuning and re - tuning on them . Then switch to Aquila 's for playing . Some may like the Martins but few wo n't love the Aquila 's .
5 #### I purchased this leather steering wheel cover for my 2003 Toyota Celica GT and love it . Then after acquiring my 2000 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup if it would fit . According to Amazon it will not fit pickups , so I measured both steering wheels and indeed the American pickup has a slightly larger steering wheel than my Japanese sports car . But I went ahead and tried it anyway , I took it off my Celica and after a lot of hard stretching , ACTUALLY GOT IT ON MY RAM PICKUP STEERING WHEEL ! ! It is a much tighter fit than the Toyota and most people will not have the skill or strength to put it on but remember mine was used in my Celica for almost a year so it was a little worn . I ordered a new one for my Celica and am keeping the older one on my RAM . Would a new cover fit any pickup ? I do not know the answer to that question , but a used one fit mine and I get to love this steering wheel cover in both my vehicles now so I am very pleased .
5 #### I have the PortaPro , which I bought when it was selling for $ 50 . The sound is incredible for something in this price range , but I feel embarrassed using it in public , even though savvy audiophiles know it 's cool . So I got the SportaPro . It 's sounds as good . But it 's not quite as embarrassing to wear . UPDATE : After nearly a month of use , I can say that not only am I pleased with the SportaPro , I favor it over the PortaPro . While the sound quality between the two is about equal , I find the SportaPro to be more comfortable , especially for wearing for a long duration . I 've addressed the aesthetics , but I 'll reiterate that I feel a bit embarrassed when I wear the PortaPro , in contrast to the SportaPro .
5 #### My son has always got his Note 3 in and out of his pocket . He works around chemicals and water . I bought this because it has a place for money ... he just lost a wallet ... and it protects the phone . He is thrilled with it . In fact several friends have asked where to get one . I was one of my best purchases and the seller was very good about getting it shipped overnight to me . Thank you Anker ... I'll be back !
5 #### The stores charge WAY too much ! Buy it here . It worked for my new HP printer . The one at the store was nearly $ 30 , but this one was closer to $ 5 . Why pay more ? !
4 #### good quality tape , exactly what the doctor ordered for an older camcorder i was gifted with . overall quality , dependable recordings .
5 #### This is a Strong Reliable capo , holds up to many years of abuse . I recommend to any guitar player !
2 #### The sound is muddy and the foam portion is designed in such a way that it is nearly impossible to seat the earpieces firmly to block out external sounds . I do n't really know which characteristic bothers me the most .
4 #### I got this case because I wanted a way to carry my iPhone without sticking it in my pocket . However I also have a silicone / plastic case on my iPhone to protect from scratches and wear . So I needed case carry case that could handle a slightly expanded iPhone size due to the plastic case . This leather case does the job very well . It has a magnetic flap so no noisy opening of the case during a quiet meeting . Once the flap is open the case hinges slightly open along the bottom edge , providing easier access to extracting your phone from this leather case . The only weakness this product has and why I do n't give it 5 stars is that the belt clip on the back side has only one rivet that attaches it to the case plus some stitching . This sounds sufficient but belt cases take a lot of strain during normal wear and tear . Eventually the rivet gives way to the strains and the stitching tears and the case gets ruined . But the low cost of this case allows me to buy a half dozen at a time so if the belt clip lasts a few days ( one did ) to months and months ( some have done that too ) I just toss it and grab the next one and start using it . The case is nice looking , it is soft and lined with even softer leather inside ( or is it man - made materials , not sure ) .
5 #### I put these on my son 's uke ( a $ 20 beginner model ) and the first thing I noticed was the warm tone . Of course , warm tone is n't that important to me ... the uke was a gift for his first birthday . What has truly impressed me is that they lasted nine months of him pounding on them as only a one - year - old can . My son is obsessed with playing his " guitar " and plays with it constantly ... an hour or more everyday . It is amazing to me , as a guitar player and teacher myself , that these strings lasted so long .
5 #### I ordered the wrong XLR cable on Amazon and when it arrived , I saw that I was going to have to send it back . Well , the restocking fee was more than this " gender changer " so I just bought it instead . It fit the bill perfectly . My mic is a male and I bought a male to 1/4 " cable so I needed something to change my male mic into a female . This worked without gender reassignment surgery and it 's very high quality .
5 #### bought 2 different kinds of deburring tools to try them out this one had a big groove down the middle of each triangle side and the other one I purchased did not just something different
5 #### Worked wonderfully . Exactly what I needed . Shipping took a bit BUT considering the price compared to other retailers well worth the wait . I got this to play music off my Ipod on an old boom box . Works great .
5 #### Had to recover information from an old computer . This worked perfectly .
4 #### I ordered this case for my sister who has a flip phone and she was very happy with it very durable and sturdy .. Fits phone just right and so far holding up ...
5 #### Take care of your expensive gear with this . keeps dust and smudges off .
5 #### This was on sale and eligible for prime so I got a very good deal on this . The quality is very good , I just found the connector that fit from those supplied , and slide the switch to correct voltage and I was off and running . Do n't let the other reviewers fool you , at least for the price I paid which was under 8.00 with free shipping this is a very good product for the money . I would buy this again .
4 #### This horn was easy to install and works great . It 's loud and has a good tone . It 's been on the boat around salt watewr for several years adn th ehorn still looks new and functions well . However , the screws which hold the horn to it 's mounting bracket came loose one at a time during the first few onths of use . Double check them for tightness and maybe remove / re - installwith locktite while installing the horn .
5 #### Seems like good quality wire , installed with a 24amp light bar and is working just fine so far .
4 #### The remote is working fine on my Canon SX50 , and I know some folks need a long cord to the camera , but for my use , it 's always in the way or tangled in the tripod or camera strap : Larry
5 #### Very cost effective . Takes unwanted resonance out of the drums . It all comes down to preference too , but I think every drummer should have a set of these .... not that you have to use them every time if you do n't want to
5 #### I like this tape better than the clear tape .... the letters seem to " pop " on the white . Very sticky and adheres well to most surfaces .
4 #### simple installation . Range is fair , but if you 're getting a glass mount you should only be using it as a local ( convoy ) comms . I have it used in conjunction with a handheld cb - radio . allows me to get decent reception on the trail in the vehicle , then take teh radio with me when on foot .
4 #### works brilliantly . the only drawback for me is that the part to go around your ear is really big and i have to keep adjusting the earpiece so that it does n't fall off , esp when i m driving ...
5 #### I bought the E71x - ATT version ( lots of excess bloat ware - removable via 3rd party apps ) . Awesome phone . Excellent build quality , ergonomics are very good , capability is excellent , love the GPS . I use it to read multiple blogs and Gmail , as well as an e - book reader . Has multiple types of tethering , including ability to act as a mobile Wi - Fi hotspot for laptops ! Good web browsing , good phone , excellent calendar . Takes a bit of time to customize everything and create shortcuts , but then it works the way I do . Love the easily replaceable battery .
5 #### Great commerce ..... ordered it quick , got it quick , was just as promised .. great product for cheap . This is why I shop with amazon ..
2 #### this product has one huge flaw it wo n't stay in the holder for nothin , i work in and around the river so this item ca nt be used in these conditions the phone repeatdly falls to the ground
4 #### Stripped down one of my basses at the weekend , found this very useful , made stripping and replacing strings really easy . Large enough to fit the fender tuners . Have 2 new sets of strings on order so fitting them wo n't be as daunting a task as without this item .
5 #### I was looking for a very long arm to support my 32 " LED screen . This product is excellently constructed . The packaging of the mounting screws was the best I have ever seen . The instructions were clear and the mounting went flawlessly . The movement was initially very stiff but by adjusting the various bolts I was able to get the freedom of movement I desired . I would highly recommend this inexpensive wall mount TV arm .
4 #### Easy to connect to my Droid Incredible each and everytime . I turn it on every time I 'm in the car , 2 hrs a day , and it had been 2 weeks and I have n't recharged it yet . Very clear sound but if you are in a car , the other end of the line would hear some engine noise , but very tolerable . A little awkward to place on ear , but like everything else , after a while you get used to it . All in all , the product works well , specially for the price .
4 #### I got this for my daughters guitar and this cable is the toughest cable for guitar I have seen / delt with . It is wonderful and especially tough for kids ! ! Good buy !
5 #### Bought these for my 2002 TJ . Very nice price followed by a great product . I 've had them on my Jeep for almost a year now and the only problem I have is the relay is fried due to getting wet . That was my fault though , so no points taken off the product . I would recommend these to anybody .
5 #### Used this as a fuel and oil treatment for many years on many cars . Excellent product . All my engines run smoothly , no knock and so I 'll keep using it . I treat 3 - 4 times a year .
5 #### Quick delivery , and met my expectations . Only have one small bubble but that comes with how careful you are applying the screen protector . All in all a good product . I 'll never go back to regular screen protectors , I love the anti glare !
4 #### I 'll be honest : when I first read about this , I was skeptical . Very skeptical . I thought , how could something as simple as a sliding lens help with such a large problem inherent to the iPhone ? Well lemme tell you this : after owning this case for a week and a half now , I can say that my skepticism is all but vanished . I give it a four out of five for two reasons : 1 . The lens slides a bit too easily in either direction . This is n't really that major of an issue , but it 'd be a bit more helpful if it actually clicked into place in either direction . 2 . The " EasyDock " bit that it advertises is n't quite so easy . At least on my iPhone 3 G , it takes a bit of finagling before it lets go of the phone to get the bottom portion off to fit the iPhone in the dock . Other than that , it 's a neat case with some unique functionality that other cases just lack . Used in conjunction with various apps ( i.e. , EverNote or Snapr ) , you can get infinite usability out of it .
5 #### I would never recommend another network card ... this card was perfectly detected by 2 verisons of Linux I have , as well as a copy of UNIX without any installation . The card is extremely reliable and my company has bought 20 without any problems , especially good for retail machines like COMPAQ 's . PCI card requires no assigning IRQ 's . Fast 100Mbps , and great support . Comes with a driver disk with any driver for any OS . Fully supported in Win2k as well ... even better than the classic NE2000 !
4 #### This is a simple , soft , easily removed cover that meets my requirements to protect the body ( not the screen ) of the phone .
3 #### I purchased this case for my new white iPhone 4s . It fits well and the clear plastic does n't detract from the sleek appearance of the phone . The cutouts on the case allow easy access to all buttons & connections . As far as protection , it will prevent scratches and most likely protect the phone from a minor fall . My major complaint is that the edges of the case are rather sharp to the touch . When my thumbs graze the edges , it feels uncomfortable . For the price , I expect the edges to be finished a little better .
4 #### After a month of use , I am quite satisfied with my purchase . The foam inserts are far more comfortable than any other style I have worn . The sound quality exceeds standard headsets that generally come with MP3 players and Walkman stereos . They are not audiophile caliber , but considering the price , they sound fine . I wear them while running and they 're sweatproof , so far -- and unaffected by any " stethoscope " effect that other reviewers have noted about Sony earphones . I can also adjust how deep I place the plug in my ear canal , enabling me to hear the environmental sounds ( sirens , horns , etc.)that affect my saftey , when running in public places . It 's too early to comment on durability , but I do treat them carefully , as I would any lightweight / portable headphones . An excellent buy at under $ 15.00
5 #### It is a Good battery if you needs High Current Density . The Battery came almost charged at 6.5 V. Charged fully and after " conditionized " at 7 V ( 2.33V per cell ) . I bought this battery to modify a Power Wheels Dune Racer from 12v to 18V. The 6 V battery needs to be at least 12AH , not to overheat . Increasing the Voltage from 12V to 18V increases the power but increases the heat generated at the motors . So I bought 4 Aluminum 540 Motor Heat Sink , and a 24V 16A speed controller .
5 #### Great cables . They do what they are supposed to do and are of good quality .
3 #### Decent , but expensive . I do n't notice anything better over the cheaper ones .
1 #### Does work for a couple months before plastic at suction cup breaks and renders it useless . Worth paying for a 3 month use item ? Probably not . Buyer beware .
4 #### Nice little product . The adhesive is n't great , but it reattaches when it comes off so far ... keeping it until it does n't work any longer
5 #### I needed this for my iPod Touch and also ordered a few extras because I lose little things easily . This mic has provided much use and definitely of better quality than I was expecting it to be . I 've even recommended this to a couple of friends .
5 #### Really Great Product , soildly built , More than happy with perfomance , and I would ecomend this product to everyone who has a need .... Its all Good !
5 #### Perfect for adding a 12V socket inside the console of my 2007 4Runner . Found some nut online that gave step by step instructions with pictures of how to take it apart .
4 #### I 've had this for over a year and the colors have definitely faded a little .
5 #### It works just like its supposed to , having the string cutter built - in is very handy too .
1 #### It 's small which is great but it is n't able to hold an iPhone with any type of case . It 's a good idea but is badly executed and unfortunately a waste of money . I 'll keep looking for something that will work , this I 'll throw in the junk drawer .
4 #### Easy install , easy to find bulb replacement - brightness , well I have had better ones .
4 #### it is just what we expected . Very nice and confortable to use . The only problems they have is that they get a bit hot when you talk , but in general they are very good Cel Phones . These days you can not get new flip phone models , so this is one of the best left before the dissapear for good .
5 #### Great pedal , same as I remembered using as a teen . 45 years later , the same great sounds . Extremely heavy duty construction .
5 #### I like this fog juice it hangs around for a while until i tell it to leave lol for the price you ca nt go wrong
4 #### Plain and simple I bought this product for a portable recording unit . My budget was low and I wanted to get a unit with multiple inputs so I could record live bands . Lucky me I bought one of these used for $ 29.00 on an impulse buy and let me tell you it was worth the $ 29.00 just as an entry level product to get me started . Tested all the inputs and the only issue I ever had was recording the second xlr input . I could never get it to record even though I saw sound coming into the channel of my daw . Which I was troubleshooting for a bit then eventually gave up . I will eventually upgrade to something else .
5 #### I am very pleased that I bought 6 of these for my DJ lights . These clamps help you quickly get setup pre - show and quickly teardown post - show . The fact that they fit both 1.5 " or 2 " bars is just icing on the cake . These clamps are well made and well priced . Get yourself a handful . You wo n't be disappointed .
3 #### I ordered this radio as as a backup for the Sony ICF - S10MK2 which I already own . I listen to the radio a lot , often news and sports and hate having ear buds in my ears 24 - 7 . While I like the design of the Panasonic alot better , it 's smaller and looks more modern , this radio does not have the reception that the Sony ICF - S10MK2 does . In fact , stations I get with ease on the other radio were difficult to find on this one . Also , the a.m. sound quality is very muffled . The little wheel that pulls in the stations is difficult to turn . If there were n't a better alternative , I imagine that this would be a good enough cheap little radio . If you are trying to decide between the two , go for the Sony .
5 #### Came fast and in good shape . It fit my truck great just like the first one did . The first one lasted for fifteen years .
4 #### Nokia has a solid reputation for very durable phones . Of the pre - Lumia generation , my favorite has been this E5 model . The operating system is a bit archaic by 2015 standards , but the durability of the actual phone and reliability of call quality and basic functions makes it a solid win . I was able to set up email easily . Running the native version of " office " programs , I was able to create documents , spreadsheets , and read PDF files easily . The ability to create multiple alarms , set timers on sound profiles , and go online ( albeit a limited version of the web ) were very helpful when on the road . I kept this in an OtterBox as long as I 've had it - and this has further prolonged its life through many bumps and falls . This phone is not really a " smart"phone , but its Blackberry - like form factor , ease of use , and quotidian reliability endeared it to me .
5 #### I have been a Meguiar 's wax customer for many years . This is my go to wax for all my cars . It cleans and protects ! goes on evenly and comes off quick resulting in a clean shine ! Best of all it comes at a very affordable price . Wax will easily hold up to continued washes and harsh S.Dakota winter weather for 6 months . Tired of fancy waxes that do not last ? Try the Meguiar 's Cleaner Wax , you wo n't be disappointed !
3 #### Got the correct product except the picture shows the " Level 360 " version and I received the old version that did n't have the Evans 360 technology . I 'll see if I can get the Level 360 version from the seller
4 #### The cable ( and circuit breaker ) work well . It is convenient being able to mute at the instrument when I ca n't reach the board . I had originally planned to buy a 20 footer , but it dawned on me that with a 10 footer and a coupler , I could make it as long as I wanted or needed . So , I use a regular cable to the board and then couple the 10 footer to get the circuit breaker to my position ... works great and is very versatile . The cable itself is a little stiff .... not as supple as many other cables , but that 's not a major problem . Once you figure out the button ; ' In = On ' and ' Out = Off ' , it is very convenient .
5 #### I waited to review this product to see if time would show it is no good , and it did not show me that . This is the best blue tooth device i have ever seen or used and have already convinced 3 other people to switch . The battery lasts for I would guess about 8 hrs of talk time and 2 - 3 weeks without a charge with me only using it a little each day . The sound is better than using my phone and people can hear me without any static . The only improvement that I can think of is to put a battery meeter to let you know how much power is left instead of it just dying on you . I just try to charge it every 1 - 2 weeks now before it dies and it is great .
5 #### I mainly got this product for my leather jacket that I have n't used in a few years and looked faded and felt stiff . It was so stiff it started to warp and bend that I got worried it would stay that way or get ruined . When applying I used a terry sponge bonnet and as I applied the conditioner to the black jacket inside lining ( testing ) it first came on really wet . I got a little worried but let it sit for two minutes and eventually the leather absorbed it . Before I had applied the conditioner my jacket had a faded almost ashy black and after applying the product it brought out a nice deep rich color and think it looks better than when I first bought it . Plan on using this product on all my leather items .
5 #### I bought my IMP500 several months ago and my whole family loves the product ! The IMP500 can power many different products such as Nintendo DS Lite , Gameboy , or a Ipod Touch to name a few . This is a very long life solid power pack . It usually lasts for days of intermittent use without needing to be recharged . I share the power pack with my son who uses it for his Nintendo DS Lite and his IPod Touch and my wife who uses it for her phone . This is a very versatile product with a lot of power in it . The indicator lights tell you how much juice is left and flash when you recharge the power pack . The on / off switch insures you do n't accidentally discharge the power pack . I have no complaints about this product and would highly recommend it .
5 #### This product is exactly what I was looking for . It works well and is easy to tighten and release . It keeps things from moving around in the bed of my pick - up .
3 #### Some pins were bent inside and had to be corrected before use
4 #### Slipped right in , extremely easy install . The only improvement ( in my humble opinion ) in installing these is to make sure you can easily UN - INSTALL them . This pertains the to the ~ 2 " dia retaining ring . As supplied from Warn , it is a real b!$%ch to un - clip . Do yourself a favor and " bend out " one or both ends , making it much easier to un - clip when it is time for service .
1 #### Would love to talk to the seller about this one , but I guess that old saying " you get what you pay for " is oh so true . These screen protectors all sucked ! None of them , and I tried all of them , stuck to the screen of my Iphone . Do n't know what is missing , but they do n't work . I guess that 's why they did n't cost very much . Love the privacy screen concept , love the mirrow image , but these do n't work . Would love for these to be replaced , but again , you get what you pay for !
3 #### This case is comfortable in the hand , fits the iPhone 4S nearly perfectly ( the opening for the mute switch is slightly off , but does n't effect functionality ) . The problem ? After - market power cables and headsets may not fit , because the openings are too small . An exacto knife can solve this problem , but who wants to go through this effort ? One other positive note about this case : unlike many others , it does not ruin flash photography .
5 #### I highly recommend this net , as it has full plactic hooks ( not plastic coated metal ones ) . The price was exceptional and is a great value . These nets are so much better than single line bungees , for items such as helmets and jackets .
4 #### Great little utility console , I love the fact that I can use it as a small mixer , or as a distribution amplifier . As others have stated its a little tough to figure out what goes where and how it works but once you get it you 'll wonder why you were having trouble and it will all make sense . The documentation is a little lacking .
5 #### I love this product ! It works for 3/4 and 4/4 sizes and is the best for putting moisture back into the your instrument ! I am a private violin instructor and I give these out to my students when they start lessons and they also make great simple yet meaningful gifts !
4 #### My daughter has a Corolla that she uses only occasionally.(she takes public transportation mostly ) . For a 14 year old car , it 's in great mechanical shape . It had started to develop little rust around the rear wheel wells . If you do n't deal with rust , it slowly destroys the vehicle . A couple of afternoons of sanding , puttying and painting and her car looks good . I wo n't lie and tell you it looks like a body shop , but I think we did a pretty good job . Great to be able to find all the parts and supplies we needed in one place .
5 #### It is exactly the GPS what you need . Simple , ligth , portable , it talks in different language . So it has everything you need as a normal GPS user at an excellent price .
2 #### I like the pressure gauge its east to read seems durable but the problem is with the tip it has a ball that moves from one valve to the next but it does not work well at all . I 've taken it apart cleaned it but this cheap plastic ball makes it difficult to change which valve air come out of even the $ 5 harbor freight ones do n't have this problem . My friend wanted one so I bought him the clone of this one works better and was cheaper . update : gauge is 10 psi out of calibration even my Harbor Freight was within 2 psi , leaks from the chuck stem where connects to hose from the day I got it . Wish I bought the copy of this that my friend has which is cheaper and apparently made better .
5 #### Excellent guard , arrived in perfect condition . Very practical and easy to fit perfectly flush covers the phone to keep conmtra scratch or hit the surface directly .
2 #### I bought an unlocked version of the K790a on April 27 . I like it very much but yesterday , June 20 , it suddenly displayed the message " Insert SIM " when I was trying to make a call . I turn it off , checked and cleaned the SIM card and battery contacts . Then I tried to turn it on but the phone refused to do so . A little red light in the infrared port flashes once or several times in every attempt to turn it on . I am not giving one star but two as a guy called Jairo of Sony Ericsson 's technical support staff was very friendly and kind . I will have to send the phone to Sony . Pretty bad for such an expensive item .
5 #### I bought this for my Dean Edge 4 , which fits perfectly in it . ( As an aside , my Fender Jazz and Edge 9 do n't fit - but that 's not why I bought this case ) . It is lightweight and durable enough to protect against anything I might let happen . I can not ask for more . For the price , I would buy it again .
4 #### This is exactly as I expected and as described . Simple to install . Sturdy " module " attachment via included Super Glue . Cable is long enough for three items . I ran mine through a large eye - screw in the wall to keep the systems from going anyplace . I suppose this item might deserve 5 - stars - but , by necessity and function , it 's not every attractive . Not really Kensington 's fault on that . But something ingenious would earn a 5th star :)
1 #### The end that connects to my laptop broke inside , so I will never hear the sound again , until I replace my laptop
1 #### The first time I tried these strings was on March 27th 1979 . Not only did I find them quite shrill , less than 24 hours later the partial meltdown at the 3 Mile Island nuclear power plant occurred . Then years later I heard some changes had been made to this product so I thought I 'd give them another shot . That was on April 25th 1986 and again less than a day later another disaster at a nuclear facility , the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine . Coincidence ? Perhaps . Finally in early March 2011 , with the advent of the newly developed " Nanoweb " coating I decided to give these strings one last try . Those poor people at Fukushima . I would highly recommend you not use these strings and try John Pearse 200L 's instead . Not only are the Elixers excessively bright , who knows what sort of disaster may be averted by not using them ?
5 #### Was as specified and went up in less than 30 minutes . Very well constructed . Will hold a lot of TV weight ! ! ! Great range and versatility . Would highly recommend !
1 #### I am sending it back . It is broken on the side and it is so sharp it could cut you .
5 #### These sound amazing . I highly recommend getting some sort of headphone amp / dac so you can get the most from these fabulous cans . I heard a pair plugged into an Eddie Current Balancing Act tube amp and could not believe my ears . You can always upgrade your amp , but might not ever want to upgrade these headphones . Although , the much more expensive HD800s do sound amazing .
4 #### Used it to replace the original muffler on an ' 89 Cadillac with an pipe adapter . It fit very well . A little more " tone " than I thought belonged on a Sedan DeVille , but way better than the Flowmaster she wanted ! Dynomax Super Turbos are great mufflers from a sound and performance standpoint , but it seemed a bit much in this case .
5 #### Battery was shipped via us mail and arrived undamaged . It was well sealed and is the exact relpacement of the battery I had . It works fine in my Lenovo T60 .
5 #### Once again Amazon has the links to the best prices . It was great to find this product at half the manufacturer 's price . This is the same deal as printer ink .
5 #### I bought two of these for my acoustic guitars . They work very well when used properly . Other reviewers have complained that the sponges evaporate quickly , but I think this is to be expected when used on a dry guitar . Usually , I have to re - hydrate the sponge after 3 or 4 days .
5 #### Great cheap alternative to buying a special dealer tool . Used 1/2 inch rachet to wedge to frame to keep pulley from moving when removing the pulley bolt .
5 #### Work 's great ! Of course we are putting it in a bare care , so easier than taking things out !
5 #### I bought this for my husband and he loves it ! He uses it every day . It is greatly made , great quality , great buy !
5 #### saved a lot of money with these . nice add on to the trk on my 01 silverado ext cab . wow
3 #### It works as long as it is plugged in to the 12v socket . Unfortunately it fits poorly in our Volvo 12 v socket . We will need to find one with a better fit .
5 #### This product functions as it is supposed to ; I have absolutely no complaints about that ( in the one month that I 've had the product ) . However , I was expecting a blue and black outer shell as was depicted in the product picture , though the one I received was ALL black on the outside . That does n't affect functionality , though an accurate picture would have been nice . Overall great product .
3 #### It looks nice and has a bit of a rubberized suface , but it is based on hard plastic . Its really hard to take off though , because the snaps get caught in the seam of the phone and I was worried I would break something . Its also pretty thick : it adds about 4 mm to the phone , so in the end I decided not to use it since I keep the phone in my pocket , and because it recessed all the phone 's buttons making them harder to push .
5 #### Use it every time I restring my guitar , works really good . I recommend this to any musician that plays regulary .
3 #### I ordered this product to replace a post that had broken on the back of my phone case . What arrived was NOT what was pictured here . Instead , it was a different version , with base plates shaped completely differently . I was able to attach the post with generous application of superglue , but it was n't what I expected .
5 #### LeBlanc Soft Metal Polishing Cloth Set . I 've been using one of these polishing cloths on silver plated trumpets for at least 20 years . The gray side is finally turning black in places from the silver , which means it 's time for a replacement . Since these work so well , I saw no reason to change brands , and just ordered two more . The pink inner cloth does a great job of removing spots and tarnish , and the gray cloth restores the silver to a perfect shine without using silver polish . Highly recommended .
5 #### I have experience with these from an old CD player that used them . Ordered six pair for a church assisted listening system and they are startlingly clear with great bass response . AND you can hear everything going on around you while listening too . The do n't isolate the listener from the rest of the world . I could n't be happier .
4 #### This is a high quality bag made of dense material . The padding is adequate for car travel , but this is not the protection that a traveling musician would want . The bag is about six inches longer than my Casio keyboard needs , but the extra space comes in handy for the adapter and pedal . On the downside , the outside pockets are skimpy and I do not trust the shoulder strap to hold the instrument . I think it is a good deal for the $ 35 price .
5 #### SO perfect - I am glad that I found this on here . I ran out of tape and could n't find it anywhere since Office Depot and Staples have all closed up by me . I prefer the white tape because I label all of the light switches in my house so that my kids know what switch is for what and I am going to label the back of out Firestick remotes now so that we know which remote belongs in what room .
5 #### Elixir strings are very good { top notch } . I have used them before and was happy to find them on Amazon . I use them both on my guitar and banjo . They sound good and wear very good as well . They are a great product ! ! !
5 #### I just installed a network between my two home computers , and this cable did the job perfectly . It worked just like it is supposed to , and the 50 ft length gave me all the cable I needed , with plenty left in case I decide to re - arrange the desk locations . WELL worth the $ 10.99 price .
5 #### My stand arrived well packed and in perfect condition . I found everything to function properly , was very easy to assemble . Was just what I wanted ! Great stand for this price point and more .
5 #### This drive performs without fail . I have seven of these 1 GB hard drives and all have been excellent . I use these formatted with a Mac so I can speak only for Mac performance .
4 #### I received my order and everything was as described . I am pleased with my item .
5 #### My girlfriend 's daughter buys the steering wheel covers from the store . The kind they sell now absolutely suck . I hate them because they just slip on and are n't snug all the way around the wheel like this style does . When I was looking I was glad to find this . If I had n't I would have used one of the types they sell in the stores and then got out the needle and thread and stitched it closed . I hate the open on the inside type . It drive me nuts when driving . I think it 's distracting and not as safe . Companies ought to be ashamed for selling crap like that and not something like this . I suppose it is easier to install something like the store ones but I do n't consider this style hard at all . You just slip the thing on the steering wheel and lace it up . I believe there are instructions , not that I noticed because I 've put a number of these on over the years with all the beaters I 've owned with nasty and worn steering wheels . I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their steering wheel for whatever reason , looks , grip , covering wear or nastiness .
5 #### I was very impressed with these head phones . These phones are for musical clarity and are not overly bassy . I have hooked an inline signal amplifier to these phones playing Amazon prime music via blue tooth connection with awesome results .
5 #### it 's a clamp , what can you say , it holds the light . it is metal and not plastic . A huge plus in my eyes . good and sturdy .
4 #### The belt clip on mine broke off within a couple of weeks but it has prevented my iPod from getting scratched at all . I can put my iPod in my pocket with my keys without worrying . I recently dropped my iPod on the the cement and the case cracked but the iPod was unharmed . This case is n't the highest quality but it 's a cheap way to keep your iPod free of scratches .
3 #### Falls over too easily . Better to make your own from a 4X4 !
4 #### This was from 3 phones ago ( at least ) . But I remember it did the job well . I had no problems with it .
4 #### Not bad - fits my G&L ASAT classic , but not my Jazzmaster . It is quite a bit bigger then a regular strat / tele style case . I 've got a few gator cases for various axes , and they work well , nothing earth shattering .
1 #### tightened worked well for couple days then loosened up and I tightened it and now it still rattles around .
5 #### This is my first digital camera . For the money , I 'm convinced it ca n't be beat . The pictures are first rate . For a " lower " priced camera , it is full of all of the bells and whistles you could ask for . The Panorama feature is my favorite . If you 're not into gizmos , just point and shoot . It 's very simple . I 've never used one before and I was e - mailing pictures to my family within 30 minutes after the UPS driver handed it to me . Only two minor complaints . The attached lens cover ( which is great ) has to be closed part way until the lens retracts back into the camera . This has to be done gingerly as it is too easy to jam it against the side of the lens by accident . Also , on the top of the camera is a small electronic control panel that tells you how many pictures you have left , picture quality etc . The symbols across the top row are very hard to see as they are too close to the camera body . A slight shadow covers them unless you have plenty of light . All things considered , I 'd buy it again in a second .
4 #### Might interfere with backup warning sensors because of how far the step sets back from the vehicle even using the closest setting . This feature does make the step safer overall , but it is something to be aware of .
5 #### I installed on a C4 corvette with full 3 in exhaust , headers , and a modified engine , it has a very nice rumble , and very loud at WOT .
5 #### A super switch at a great value . I use essentially as a " splitter " so that I can have both a laptop and a network printer on my desk .
3 #### the winder works really well and same with the cutter , but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome . i guess for taking w/ you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool , but if using at home , then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter . that 's what i do anyway . still i think is a good tool to have .
5 #### as a drummer who is always trying to improve any Vic Firth stick is a great start . i have tried many other brands and Vic is King n my world . The SD1 's are balanced perfect for me . after playing sticks that seemed end heavy , playing with these turned me into a better drummer instantly
3 #### This is a great case , if you like talking into something that 's nearly the size of a ham sandwich . I understand protecting the phone from harsh conditions like those that IT folks face crawling around server racks and such , but the phone is only protected when it 's in the holster . The only thing that covers the screen is a thin plastic film that will not stop damage from impacts and only offers minor protection from scuffs ( blunt surfaces only ) . The Body Glove snap on case offers a little less protection and a LOT less bulk at the body but gives you a thick piece of hard plastic to shield the screen . I can live with scuffs and scratches on the body of a phone , but a scratched or broken screen can make the phone worthless . I appreciate the protection built into the Otterbox for the phone body , I just do n't understand why it leaves the screen almost completely unprotected . I returned this and got the Body Glove case , I 'm much happier .
4 #### Used with my ETREX Legend HTC . Keep in mind that this back WILL NOT FIT this model of GPS . The Legend HTC comes with the back piece that screws on . But this handle bar mount works with that back piece . Would be handy if the mount was sold by itself for an affordable price . I usually find that buying this set is cheaper , but it 's kind of a waste too .
5 #### Just received it , it seems to be working well and of good enough quality ; I will be ordering more tonight .
4 #### I have owned this lens for about a month now . I opted for this one instead of the 18 - 55 mm kit lens upon reading numerous reviews that it is a great general purpose lens for starters . I have to say I am impressed with Canon 's USM system ... and a relatively fast auto focus . I have n't had a single time when the subjet was out of focus because of the len 's mistake . It is pretty sharp around f5.6 all through the focal range .. mostly within 28 - 80 mm range . To sum up : Pros : - A good general purpose Canon branded lens . 28 - 105 mm is a decent focal range for starters . - USM is great . - AF is good .. mostly accurate . - Light weight , not bulky in size . - Decently sharp throughout most of the range . Cons : - Colors are not very bright or vibrant .. but a little post processing is all it needs . Final notes : The 28 - 105 mm is great for its flexible range and the decent sharpness and USM ... I have used it for everything from semi - macros to portraits to landscapes to long exposure shots at night to birds . And the build is professionally solid . Worth the money ! !
4 #### Necessary item to secure / cinch - up the hitch adapter devices wiggle - free inside the receiver . There is inevitable clearance / slop between the receiver and adapters that make taller items like bike rack adapters wiggle around a lot . You do n't notice it with trailer ball tongues but it 's always there . Tip - we substituted ny - loc bolts to avoid the inevitable loss of the lock washers over time .
4 #### Good cable . Works as advertised . Would have preferred better connectors but this style cable is a bit difficult to find pre - wired .
5 #### These were a decent price . Kid needed better reeds ..... moving up in the world . This box was exactly as described .
4 #### worked well when i needed it for emergencies in thailand . cheaper than trying to use my iPhone . the volume is low so must use in quieter places . the card that came with it gave instructions on adding minutes , the sim card was included .
4 #### Great so far . It does leak slightly which I was surprised about , but I would buy it again , and certainly over the big - box store CCC ( Cheap Chinese Cr@p ) versions
5 #### High quality product . Held my jeep XJ and TJ both up no problem .
4 #### We use this cable to connect our Behringer C-1 Mic to the audio mixer we use for talking on the web . We mix using this cable and can send audio from several sources into one chat by using these cables for low impedance audio devices .
5 #### Just what I needed for using my r12 hoses on my r134a bottle .
5 #### This is my second head set and I love it . Voice reception is great , no dropped calls , no static . You may have to experiment with the ear ring to find the best fit . There are lot of fake ones in the market . Make sure that you get one with Samsung retail box .
3 #### I really did not need them at this time but good to have
5 #### Installed a very cheap Chinese Bluetooth capable radio in my daughter 's 99 Regal . This REALLY made it easy .
5 #### I 'm happy with the purchase , the case looks very sturdy , no gaps when closed , my PRS Se Custom 24 , fits perfectly ...
4 #### Does notable improvement to the several garden power - tool engines I have . However it did n't fix the problem in my lawn - mover entirely : I had to disassemble and clean carburetor before the lawn - mover engine started working after it was sitting unused for a few years .
5 #### Came on time , fair price , and comparatively easy to set up . TWC took the old one and would not return it , and their " replacement " clicker is useless . This works fine !
5 #### Works great . The heavier gauge wire is much better than others offered .
5 #### Pinnacle wax is the best wax I have found for my cars . I used their product that was formulated for black cars when I owned my 2001 BMW 330i and it kept it looking like new for 14 years . This is slightly cheaper than their top of the line wax but works outstanding on my 2015 red Ford C - Max . Just waxed it this morning -- I think the fifth time I 've used this wax on the car . Still plenty left for several more wax jobs . Goes on so easy -- and more importantly -- comes off with ease . Never leaves any residue and gives a brilliant shine to your car finish . Highly recommended .
4 #### just what I wanted . Good sound , easy to use . It 's a shame it was left on stage when we opened up for Toad the Wet Sprocket . Guess I 'll need another
3 #### For a sufficiently low price , this is a pretty decent 640x480 camera , especially with a cheap MMC card added . With the driver updates listed in other reviews , it works tolerably with WinXP as well , though it 's much smoother going with Win98SE . The flash works tolerably well at night , though it 's rather overpowering if you 're too close to the subject . Its TWAIN driver is also annoying , as it apparently gives no way to download raw images ( all are pre - processed before download ) . One suggestion made in another review , though , is completely off - track : an MMC card reader CANNOT BE USED with this camera ! ( Has the reviewer who suggested it ever actually used this camera ... ? ) Photos are saved to the card in an annoying proprietary format , which means that it can not be read other than with the camera . I 'd strongly suggest use of a 9V battery eliminator for downloading , or you 'll find yourself going through batteries at quite a clip ! Another shopping site also states clearly that MMC cards > 16 M in size do not work properly with this camera . There 's a lot of misinformation present about this camera in the reviews and links here - caveat emptor !
5 #### what can you say they work well very high quality labels and at a good price . I really like the Casio label maker these go in have had it for years and it works great .
4 #### Great when I 'm sitting out in the bleachers although has have been mentioned by others you have a very steady hand to keep view from bobbing .
5 #### I have had a pair of the fantastic Canon 18x50 IS binoculars for years . I wanted a smaller pair to use when closer to objects .
4 #### These are bit thin and therefore not supper strong . However for the quantity and variety of sizes , this item is a good purchase .
5 #### The Absorber is amazing ! I have had mmine for since early 2003 and it still works as well as the day I bought it . I wash two vehicle about every 3 weeks or so during the spring to fall seasons and there is not a sign of wear on it . Best way to dry your car money can buy ! If it accidentally gets dirty , I throw it in the wash and it comes out ready to go again . You ca n't go wrong !
4 #### I own several pair and have owned several pairs of headphones . These rank up there with my very expensive headphones as far as sound quality goes in a small package . Of course you are not going to beat the big bulky head phones that fit snug on your ears though . These headphones do n't hurt your ears after a long time using them like those in - ear ( ear buds ) do either . I would not use these head phones for working out though as the tend to slip off of your head . The more you sweat and move the more they slip . It is very bothersome when you are using cables and you lean forward and your headphones slide off of your head and hang while you are in the middle of your set . Bottom line : If you are just going to walk or sit and listen to your headphones you can not beat these headphones ... especially for the money - you just ca n't . Now if you are going to workout or do anything that causes movement and sweating , even yard work , then go with something like the Philips SH390 ( inexpinsive around $ 13.00 ) that are snug . Again , you can not beat the Panasoni RP - HT21 for the price - just be worned if you attempt to work out with them .
5 #### I am a music teacher working with beginning students and they go through a lot of reeds before they learn how to keep them from breaking . Rico reeds are consistent , affordable , and easy to get . Amazon has a good price , and they get them to me quick .
1 #### I bought this as a replacement for my husband 's iphone . Previously he had the noel collection case which came with mirror screen protector . This product compared to the old screen protected is extremely poor quality . The mirror is very faded and when in active mode it makes your screen a green / blue color . I know these are cheap but I recommend going for the better quality ones . I went for these and now have to buy a better one and pay shipping all over again , do n't make the same mistake .
5 #### What can you say when you want the best you purchase Zildjian be it drumsticks or cymbols ; like I said Zildjian is the best you can buy and well worth the money .
5 #### I love these headphones , as well as the MDR - V600 headphones . I believe the oil from your skin over time will cause the coating to slough off of the earphone padding skin . However , since hygiene is of utmost importance , especially if more than one person is using the headphones , I have purchased some sanitary headphone covers . This not only keeps the headphones clean , it also makes the headphone ear pads last forever . Just an idea , but try using sanitary headphone covers on ALL your headphones . I believe you can buy a bag of 100 on - line for about $ 18.00 . It 's definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones . I use them in my home studio , and the frequency response is excellent , and I can hear every note , not to mention the exceptional large drivers ( 50 - mm ) that the headphones contain .
5 #### This fit my ' 81 land cruiser steering wheel . Has a good feel . I 'd buy again .
4 #### Works fine , but I wish the spray was little finer ; it seems to blast out too fast .
5 #### For my 1999 Subaru Forester , it does the job as expected . What more can I ask for ? Great jack stands .
2 #### I bought this so I could use my macbook pro while sitting in bed . So far , I ca n't see that it makes any difference . My macbook 's fan spins up within 5 minutes of being put on top of this .
3 #### The sponges are too small in order to keep a normal level of humidity inside your case . 45 % to 55 % of RH . If the heat is strong , like in my apt in NY , expect to have inside your case 35 % of RH , it is not enough for your guitar . I had to add on the headstock an additional kitchen sponge in a zip bag . Of course I use only distilled water .
3 #### I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BESTFRIEND AND HE SAID THAT YOU CAN NOT USE THIS WHILE YOU ARE ON THE PHONE BUT IT DOES WORK IF YOUR IN A PINCH .
1 #### This company is ramping all about how their " technology " is patented and unique . There 's nothing special about this cover . First , it does n't feel natural to touch . It feels like layer or soft rubber and makes it little harder to scroll . Second , the application is not that easy . You get your iPhone all wet and have to wait days for it to dry . This whole thing is just a mess . And last , the packaging : It 's huge . I had no idea what was in the box . I though actual iPhone was in it , because it was heavy . I got awesome cover from Power Support , and their cover blows this one out of the waters.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Power - Support - Anti - Glare - Film - Set - for - iPhone - Original / dp / B001B1BKZ6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Power Support Anti - Glare Film Set for iPhone ( Original)</a >
5 #### What a great product ! I plugged a PS3 , xbox360 , two computers , and our DSL cable ( all ethernet cables ) into this switch and now all four systems have internet connection . It was that simple ! My only regret is that I got did n't get the 8 - port switch . I did n't realize that the DSL connection goes in one of these front 5 ports . I thought perhaps there was a port in the back ( similar to a USB hub ) . I was hoping to have one port available to plug a laptop in , but the four systems and DSL connection uses all five available ports .
5 #### I wonder why Steve Jobs did not desing the iphone with the regular plug ... I am happy with the adapter , I can get more out of my iphone .
4 #### I loved this product right from the beginning , just from seeing how it combined the program listings from my cable and DirecTV providers into on guide , and would automatically switch between inputs depending on what channel I selected . Seems logical , but no one had ever done it before ! The 2020 is the way to go at the moment , because you 'll find this so addictive that any less storage space will not be enough . I find that the Standard recording quality ( which yields 20 hours of recording ) works fine for me at the moment with both my DSS and cable programming , considering it 's better than I was getting with VHS . I suppose that if you get hooked on the better quality , it would probably be hard to go back . I was disappointed that the 2020 does * not * come with Firewire ports as advertised here on Amazon.com , as a box with future programming improvements * and * expansion possibilities was really exciting . Once the copy protection issues are worked out , I 'd love to be able to add another 20 hours to the unit with an external drive , but maybe Replay will facilitate that somehow . Anyhow , the bottom line is : This unit is in many ways the home entertainment appliance I 've been looking for for many years . It 's smart , it 's convenient , and it can only get better as features are improved and small bugs are removed . When was the last time you were able to upgrade the firmware of your VCR ?
1 #### Very Disappointed with this microphone . Admittedly I did n't expect much , but it 's even worse - in fact it 's not usable . Do NOT buy this microphone . I was looking for an omni - directional microphone and this seemed to be my only inexpensive option . I was hoping that Pyle would make an inexpensive omni , but I could n't find one . I do like their directional mike the PDMIC58 which is very good . This microphone is going in the trash .
5 #### Got what I ordered & working so I 'm a HAPPYcamper
4 #### Made my job of repacking my front wheel bearings and changing grease formulations easy .
5 #### Went on fine . Sounds good . Probably not much different than any other brand name string to be honest though .
3 #### I really like the smooth feel and longevity aspect , but I 've tried these strings twice now , and both times a string snapped on me while tuning . Both cases about 2 - 3 weeks into use . I 've never really had that happen with other strings , maybe just once in the last few years ? I 'm a light player , so this does strike me as odd .
5 #### I use my Garmin in my aircraft as a reference . This case allows me to clip to a perfect place and still see . Amazon was the only place I could find online .
4 #### I bought it because the pillow speaker said it did not have a volume control and it did so i have n't opened it up so i really ca n't give a rating . I have bought Koss headphones and they were good so i ca n't see any difference with this product .
1 #### Would not work . Tried on 4 different PC's / laptops with different OS 's .
5 #### Easy plug and play extension . Perfect for my homemade trailer .
3 #### Solid wood wall hanger . The logo on the mounting block is a big issue . With a crappy company name and logo why would you want to put it front and center ? The drywall mounting screws are better than average and self tapping . I originally bought one , the a second one ( I simply clicked the ' buy again ' button ) but the color of the second oak hanger is noticeably darker . I know with natural items like wood colors vary , but if you buy more than one do n't expect them to match .
4 #### This little gem came as a package deal with the Trent iCarrier . It does n't have the same capacity as the iCarrier but it 's not as heavy or as bulky either . The iTorch easily fits in a pocket . I always have one or the other with me when I 'm away from home .
5 #### Recharded my 95 Lumina that has a small leak and it seems that it is holding its charge better this year with this r134 . You will need a guage set to connect this to your vehicle and recharge but is a very easy to do .
5 #### Do n't try to save a buck by getting a cheaper cable . Some cables are very thin , like the one I got with my SanDisk MP3 . The Belkin cable is the real thing . I use this cable to connect the male stereo single plug - ins of my MP3 ( SanDisk Sansa Clip ) to my boom box . I 'm very happy with the way it works . Anywhere it calls for either a 1/8 " stereo or a 3.5 mm stereo cable , this Belkin cable is going to work . It is well worth the price , and you ca n't get it for less anywhere else as far as I can tell . This is a rare product that I endorse by saying , if it 's the correct cable for your connection , do n't think anymore but just get it . Really .
5 #### Use these all the time in my 2009 Yamaha R1 with no issues at all over the past 6 years
5 #### I absolutely love this case . It 's super classy , fits well and protects the phone from side drops with rubberized sides . The wood inlay is beautiful and authentic . You can feel the grain in the wood and can see the depth of the wood when looking at the engraved Boxwave logo . I always place my phone face down now , in public , so people can see the classy case . Silly , I know . It 's just so nice , I like to show it off . The only thing that would make me love this case more is if it came in Zebrawood . Some other brands do carry Zebrawood , but this one seemed to be the greatest qualtiy case , IMO . You ca n't go wrong with this case .
4 #### this bearing packer is a time saver and also saves stains on clothes . I got the product in record time . I would buy again from this seller in a New York minute .
5 #### I bought these as a gift for my dad for x - mas we have not put them on yet but they came in a huge box they seem really well made and people swear by them but we are waiting for nicer weather to try them out I will update in a couple weeks when we do try them out ! But well worth the money I would buy again !
5 #### My favorite picks for years and years have been the 1.0 mm Tortex picks . The Ultex feel better and provide better action . Give these a try !
5 #### Connected to my router very easily and connected to Windows 7 , 8 and Xubuntu 13.10 without any problems . Note that I bought a similar Samsung Multifunction device with not just wired but also wireless network and even faster for $ 180 . So , stand - alone network print servers like this are a dying breed . Considering a $ 35 value to the basic cartridge which comes with the printer , my new device is really not $ 180 but $ 155 . So , you can justify spending $ 10 for a print server or just connect the USB printer to the USB port of your router if possible .
5 #### Awesome for my use . I just need this incase I drop a pick and need to grab another one quickly and it works perfectly for that . I use thin picks and they seem to be held very well and I really like how the pickholder is a nice soft rubber material . Personally I could n't be happier with it .
5 #### 2 words , YOU BET ! ! ! I was having a problem with my newly installed cable TV . I had light and dark horizontal bands that would come and go , mostly come . I had read that the splitters cable companies use are cheap and unsatisfactory . I decided to spend a few extra dollars and go for the Monster 2 Gig 4 way splitter . I installed the splitter and VIOLA ! no more bands , perfect picture ! I also use Monster Video 2 coxial cable for the connection from the wall to the splitter and from the splitter to my DVD recorder . If your picture quality is lacking and you 're on the fence not wanting to fork out a few extra bucks , believe me it is definitely worth it .
3 #### They work great while they last but they did n't last but a few months . Granted my dog ran by and hooked the cord and sent them flying out of the audio jack but one would expect them to be able to handle a little wear and tear like that instead of immediately breaking .
5 #### But your mileage may vary . They sound great right out of the package , and Amazon has the best price anywhere . They tend to last a long time as well .
5 #### Especially in plastic headlights and rear lights . Requires a little bit of " elbow grease " but you get a huge improvement no matter what you begin with .
5 #### Very good price for a quality product that I have used for the greater part of 30 years .
5 #### Excellent product ! Helps keep my Taylor 214ce at the correct humidity .
5 #### Had some rough torque shudder at 35 - 40 mph under light acceleration . Added this to my 07 Expedition and it removed about 95 % of the shudder . Went ahead and did a full fluid change and added this to the new fluid . Zero torque shudder now .
1 #### I ordered this to pair with my iPhone 4s and it did n't work point blank . It was charged and ready to go but would not pair with any blue tooth devices . Total waste of money .
5 #### Looks great on my Gretsch Jim Dandy . Visualy complements the classic roots vibe od the guitar . Comes with a tie cord for acoustics . I have a few guitar straps from Levy 's Leathers and they never disappoint . They are my go - to brand for straps .
4 #### I like this as it has the 2 USB ports and 2 power outlets . I have two USB power adapters now I can charge 6 items from this one unit ! Mounts easy and is fused !
5 #### Amazing for Folk and Classical guitars , not much with Electric guitars ...
5 #### Good quality - We especially like the taller wire separators which keep files from flopping over .
5 #### ITS A COW BELL ! fit right in thanks Jeff
3 #### For a Monster product , this guy is kind of cheaply made . Like another reviewer said , it just kind of feels cheap . I know its just a power strip , and that s why a bought a cheaper one , but it seems a bit inferior for a Monster product . I 'm really no fan of theirs , but at least their products LOOK and FEEL as if they are better than the rest . This one , however , seems like it would fall apart with minimal abuse . I have another APC brand surge protector that my computer stuff is plugged into that is far and away superior to this thing .
5 #### The Sangean ATS 606AP is a nice little radio for the money . I find it particularly useful for listening in bed . It is a good performer in this area of the world . While it is a good value with free shipping , as far as I can determine this radio was never priced as high as [ money ] ... [ I ] review it favorably ... Passport rates it as the best buy in a pocket model . It is a basic SW receiver that is easy to operate . I am glad that I bought it .
5 #### What can you say ? It works perfectly and is of high qulity .
5 #### Insert to phone and start using right away . An extra 64 gb .... WOW !
5 #### Does what it needs to do . Always used K&N for all my filter needs , and as usual , Amazon had the best price ! Defiantly recommend if this filter is within your space requirements !
2 #### creates too much glare . Better to use camera and reverse to see your own image . I wish I still had my original screen protector .
5 #### Clearly written book explains Chromebook procedures in easy to follow chapters . I bought this Chromebook for my sister - she is challenged by new technoilogy ! She had it working the first day ! I was so impressed - bought another for myself !
4 #### this did not have enough tension on the hook when I first tried it . bending it down fixed it- it is a very cheap and flexible plastic but works when you bend the hook down , needs occasional assistance but at that price I 'd buy a few , expecting to get a few months out of each one . works better than the unit that clips the middle of the top- most i580 's break there
5 #### Arrived on time . Amazing quality acoustic strings . They hardly need cleaning . They stay clean unlike other brands .
5 #### These cables and Wall plug in work great for our phones . I have the Samsung Note 3 and my boyfriend has the Samsung S4 .
4 #### decent stings to have as a backup , but i need something heavier gauge for what i have been writing these days . good all around strings though
5 #### Pretty good pedal . Performs how you would expect it to from the looks . Has decent resistance like a real pedal too .
5 #### Fast and effiecient service is much appreciated among many , and that is all this company offers ! i ordered this for my girlfriend cause she always loses her chargers , and these work much better than the original that came with her phone ! they are excellent !
5 #### Great combination of everything you need to restore the original finish . Perfect results when done .
5 #### Currently running two of these in our small business server room . These run much cooler than the old Dell switches they replaced . Great transfer speeds with no hassles . Hope to have them for the long term .
5 #### I 've always trusted the Belkin name . When I needed to purchase a USB cable for my new laser printer , it seemed I immediately turned to this product . They 've always functioned well for me and the pricing is a budgetary plus !

5 #### Always have to keep your screen protected and nothing better then 3 for the price of one . Pick these up .
5 #### This is an inexpensive , high quality cover to protect your Nook . It fits the reader perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone !
5 #### I think this is a great phone . As mentioned , the Danger network is no longer available , therefore some of the features do n't work . But for the low price and the quality of the phone , it 's well worth it . The screen swivels open smoothly . Colors are vibrant . Instructional cd is a great help for some of the trickier features . And T - Mobile is always eager to help . I was able to copy my sim card address book over easily . So until I qualify for a new phone on my t - mobile plan , this phone will do just fine and be fun to use too . My only dissappointment I will mention is the memory card was not included in the packaging . I read that in someone elses review and emailed Amazon before my phone shipped and they confirmed that it would be present . But it was n't . :( Its mentioned in the advertisement as being part of the package . So be aware of that . Although Amazon has kindly offered to compensate me , I would have just preferred the memory card to be included . Update- Amazon has given me a little bigger refund which allowed me to purchase the memory card seperately . Thank you Amazon !
5 #### These are very good quality covers . I liked my soft KC covers with the dark sunglasses , but these are much better and fit tighter .
4 #### Bought these headphones to use with my ipod . Read an on line professional review which was high on these and I was not disappointed . Prior to purchase had tried several other manufacturers including Sony and these were much superior . I attribute the quality to the use of neodymiun magnets which yields very clear highs and a full range .
5 #### This is not the " best " capo I have in terms of quality , but I have one of these in every guitar case . A lot of capos use this same design , but the Kyser seems to last a lang time , with no change in tension , Now that I think of it , I don;t even know where that expensive G7th capo is .
3 #### Are these the worst screensavers I have ever used ? Yes but what can you expect for 64 cents ? The item arrived in a few days out of PA and beat the estimated arrival time . I have tried several screens savers over the years and I had more air bubbles with these ones than w/ any other that I 've used . I wasted the first one because if you do n't put it on just right it sticks a little outside of the screen . That can happen with almost any screensaver but it seemed worse on these ones . I had to cut the corners , as well . I would probably buy these again because you get 3 and you ca n't beat the price . If you want a professional , thick screen saver then go buy one of the nicer ones . But if you just need something basic and do n't mind the air bubbles then I would buy them . I personally do n't need anything fancy so it works for me .
4 #### If I have purchased only this one , I would be satisfied . But I have purchased XtraFlex2 , and the last one is better in its major function - convenience in reading in bed . Light is brighter and weight is well balanced .
5 #### We love these little Zenergy chimes ! The sound is pure and loud , and the presentation with the wooden base , aluminum rods and little mallot is quite beautiful . Buy one , you wo n't regret it at all . We bought our first set of these , the Zenergy5 with five chimes , as a bit of a lark . They rapidly became a favorite , which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time . The chimes sat on an end table , and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them . We lost the five - note chimes after we had a party and our house , and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them . At the end , we gave the chimes to him , which delighted him , and of course delighted us as well . The next day , we purchased the Zenergy3 three - rod version of the chimes , simply to have something different . We are equally happy with the three - tone chime . Hint : Be sure to shop around ! Vendors offer these chimes here on Amazon at a variety of price points , including shipping .
5 #### I use this almost every day . The phone fits snug and the latch is secure . Great value
3 #### This product I 'm sure works in some cases but in the case of my VHS cleaning job , it did not work . It did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture . I gave it 3 stars rather than one star because I do n't know if a wet VHS head cleaner would have done the job better and I made a poor selection or if the VHS is failing in a different way .
4 #### It could of have fit better . Although it will keep rain , dirt and dust off of the winch when its in storage .
5 #### Used to connect my Casio Privia Digital Keyboard to my iPad ( along with the iPad Camera Connection Kit ) . Worked great , great transfer speed , no lag .
5 #### These are well - made and manufactured in USA ! ! There is not much to say about jumper cables , but some of the ones you see at automotive parts stores are pretty flimsy and the conductors look like they are significantly smaller than the gauge marked on the packages . These 6 - gauge are suitable for cars with medium size batteries such as compacts or older models . For a new sophisticated car with lots of electronics and a big battery ( BMW , Lexus , Mercedes , etc . ) , I suggest 4 - gauge cables instead .
5 #### Helped provide the three pairs of aftermarket speakers I added to my 15 ' Camry as well as a Rockford P1S4 10 " subwoofer a properly sound damped vehicle in order to play at the optimal performance . I could go on for ways about the solid " thumps " my doors & trunk no make as well as the rattle free performance of my trunk once I added Dynamat ( with the helped of the roller ) to my 15 ' Camry but there are hundreds of YouT videos that already illustrate that . Note though , it you 're the type of person that drives with you windows DOWN or sunroof OPEN , then DON'T expect this to make ur vehicle more quite . It simply deadens the rattles & bumps that you hear while driving & makes you vehicle like a sound studio booth for your speakers . And it does that well . Several of my friends with much larger subs ( like two 12 " ) in their trunk want to install this after seeing what it did to my 15 ' Camry .
1 #### Had trouble with this model from the time I took it out of the box . After loading the software from the CD , my PC crashed several times before I could finally get the software to load correctly . Then I could n't connect to the Internet site to download the OS software needed to use the reader ( why did n't they load this at the factory ? ? ! ! ) . Its now been two days and that site is still not available per Franklin 's Tech Services who said " just keep trying , we 're working on it . " I hope so , 'cause this piece of junk is going back to the store tomorrow if I ca n't download the software .
5 #### Nice product . Works great & fits in any bag or purse . I have never needed the light or laser but they 're good to have in a pinch . I have purchased multiple chargers & keyboards from New Trent & all of the have met or exceeded my expectations .
4 #### These chargers last a few months if you 're good to them ; a few weeks if you 're not . But nicely priced . I recommend buying a few at a time to save on shipping , and then you 'll always have a backup .
5 #### Fit my NA Mazda Miata great . They work very well too . No matter how much water is on my windshield they wipe it dry first sweep .
1 #### I just found out that the oil used in the k&n filters get on your MAS ( mass air sensor ) and screws up your engine Performance . Wait till you see how much one of those gizmos costs .
5 #### The shape of the top of this funnel looks a little odd , but the first time I used it to pour oil into my car I fully understood it . The extended portion makes a nice target for the initial pour out of a full bottle of oil . No more " first drips " to clean up .
5 #### We use this when we 'll be on the road ( more than 250 miles ) . We go to Maine every year from Florida and I do most of the driving at night when a cleaner windshield is nice to have . I mix it with distilled water and their 2 in 1 glass cleaner . While on the interstate I rarely need the windshield wipers if I clean the windshield well before heading out .
4 #### The components definitely look and feel cheap , but for the price , that is to be expected . As long as they work , who cares ?
5 #### Great product for keeping the " axe " handy . whether I 'm writing or practicing a new piece it keeps my Martin Guitar from getting knocked over or from sliding from the spot that I left it resting .
4 #### great price on Amazon , meets my needs perfectly . have HDTV , cable box , receiver , subwoofer , Blu - ray , and antenna plugged in without any space issues . flat outlet plug is a plus
5 #### Works great to play phone audio through my sterio with the red / white audio input . Hypothetically you could also use it to run your NES system 's audio through your car 's aux port .
4 #### Great camera bag to have for the amateur photographer , meaning you do n't have all of the bells and whistles to your camera like 20 different lenses . It holds the few lenses I have for the right occasion and is nice and well tailored . Very sturdy and very secure .
5 #### I ordered this Friday evening , got an e - mail Saturday morning that my item was shipped ... and it arrived Monday morning with my 10AM with the usual mail delivery . WHAT GREAT SERVICE ! ! ! The price was $ 1.00 more than the best price I could find on the internet , but with the free shipping from Amazon it was a better deal . I have bought a lot of stuff from Amazon , always had great service ... but nothing as good as this .
5 #### Purchased for mom ( elderly ) . Bought this instead of a 911 call button that hangs around her neck . She has her cell with her and can call multiple people or 911 if she needs help .
5 #### Ernie Ball- what is there to say ? It 's the king of cheap gear no matter what it is right ? I got this one specifically for extra guitars . I usually use a really nice BC Rich clip on strap , but I 've been switching out guitars lately for different sounds and having them already strapped is cuts a little time off of roadie - ing for myself lol . 7/10 : it 's quality but it 's low level quality . Like if Pyle started making guitar straps this would be the step above them . I feel good about that comparison . It 's a strap , i mean what do you want it to do- make baby straps ?
4 #### Simple radio . It does nt have a built in SWR meter so you may want to buy one as an add on to tune your antenna .
5 #### I enjoy the sound of the Block and i play it in the Church Choir . Also all my grandchildren enjoy playing the Block .
3 #### If it had n't been for the enthusiastic reviews , I would n't have made it over the setup " hump " in&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Four - Years - from - Home / dp / B0045OURSW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Four Years from Home</a > . With some encouragement from other reviewers , I stayed with it and found the middle and ending interesting . One reviewer mentions an Epilogue , which appears to show up as Chapter 14 in my Kindle for PC , version 6 display . The ending I have is precipitous and less than satisfying . A good first effort , and quite original in concept . Has its funny moments . After the slow start , it moves well and is rather gripping .
5 #### Beautiful strap . Great size too - I 'm 5'9 " Very comfortable too .
5 #### I have had this for a while and so far I have yet to have an issue with it .
5 #### Took me about 3 treatments , but it got my tan top on my Miata very clean . It did n't get out the really bad stains , but changed the overall color of the top from a grungy brown , to a nice clean tan .
3 #### I 'm sure it 's a nice cymbal but I got the wrong one .. I got a 14 " china cymbal instead .. I do n't have a printer to print out a return label and there is no way to contact Amazon properly .. bummer
5 #### Bought this for the Yamaha DGX-650B. Soft , stretchy , and slippery , fits just about right .
5 #### Works perfectly in AT@T branded Samsung Galaxy III S. Bumps up the device to 80gigs . Can copy existing videos or music from your computer .
5 #### This is a drum key . It tunes drums . It has one purpose and that 's all . I like this model because it is no - nonsense , easy on the fingers ( the plastic logo area is nice to touch ) and I 've never had one break , unlike some other generic drum keys I 've used . It is heavy enough to feel solid but is light enough to carry around in my pocket all the time . I have used and owned literally hundreds of different drum keys and some look cool but are strange feeling to use . Some do n't allow for the touch feel because of too many ridges , twisty - twirly bits , or lack of flat area where you have to press to tighten or loosen the lug . I 've used knock - off drum keys which have this basic shape but are either made from crappy metal alloy that crumble at the socket , or they have sharp ridges which rip the skin , or at least irritate it . There are hundreds of drum keys to choose from , this is my favorite .
5 #### I bought several ( five ) of these so my network cables would match and each of them work perfectly as expected .
5 #### Quickly absorbs the water ... cuts drying time by minutes . KEEP the plastic tube , it will allow it to stay moist and not get hard .
5 #### I enjoy using this trackball for long periods of time . It does n't strain my hand as my palm rests comfortably over the trackball . The trackball is extremely efficient to use in maneuvering around the computer screen . I can clean it by putting a paper clip end to unlock the ball . This is nice because debris and residue can build up immediately underneath the ball . I have had my trackball for about 9 years nine , and it still works like a gem .
5 #### These are really great strings for a competitive price . Just started using phosphor bronze recently and am really impressed with the quality over the long life of the strings .
3 #### The tray on top does n't fit back down inside once things are plugged in to a power strip
5 #### Have used these without issue in numerous installations , very good quality units
5 #### A great upgrade from the factory strings that come with a student cello at a reasonable price - point . The Helicore strings are the best but you will pay more than double for them and are probably a better option if you have graduated beyond the learner stage . We put these on my son 's cello after a year with the factory strings and he was very happy with the improvement . For someone starting out these strings will make your cello sound and play a lot better .
4 #### Case works fine . I like the belt clip which works better than the one I bought from Verizon . However , it is a tight fit for my phone .
4 #### If you are pairing these will smaller lights , like PAR38 cans or similar , they get the job done and are affordable . I purchased a lot of these and have n't had any problems .
5 #### I 've used the Chromed Convert - A - Ball System for about 10 years now , and it 's performed perfectly ... Still does ! I decided to purchase this stainless set - up for another truck , and I 'm very impressed . Quality is absolutely " Wow " ! The stainless set is flawless , and well worth the extra expense . I LIKE it .. ;~ )
4 #### So far works like a charm , will update only if something should go awry .......... !
4 #### Did n't work on my camera even tho it said it should . Gave it to a friend who 's camera it did work on . The tip here is look at the connection on your camera . Make sure your getting the correct one . As of yet I have not tried to purchase the correct one .
3 #### It 's ok . I use it on my galaxy s4 and sometimes it will unexpectedly stop detecting it . I get a message stating that the card was unexpectedly remove and then it will start loading again . It 's a bit annoying when I 'm trying to see pictures and have to wait for them to load .
4 #### Good set of Lappers . Could use a bit more " grip " from the cups .... I used it on a 4 - cycle snow blower engine ... it had a bit of a problem with the smaller cups ... you have to make sure the valve top and cup are squeaky clean , and pick the proper size ... I would imagine it would work better on automotive valves that have bigger and flatter tops
5 #### Perfect . Got me out of a jam . Local installer sold me wrong one
5 #### I live in a real rural area where the phone lines are not yet capable of high speed internet access & the phone company keeps telling me that it 'll be jet another 2 years until they upgrade the lines . I have looked into satellite internet but the people that I know that have it , hate it . Since cell phone coverage is real spotty in my area , I did n't think the MiFi would work out real well either . But I finally got to try one out and it was like I was finally liberated from the slower than death dial - up internet . I have woods & lakes all around me and I can not believe how good the access has been with the MiFi 2200 . These are super simple to setup and use , and I highly recommend them to anyone else who thought they did n't have any better options for high speed access at a reasonable monthly rate .
5 #### We have a 1999 vehicle with an awesome tape deck in it , so this is a necessity for us to listen to our playlists . It lasted for at least 8 years before the wiring gave out . Great product .
5 #### ordered a few of these they work great . Perform like the newest cables with out the cost . A true buy .
5 #### Love Love Love this camera ! ! ! My girlfriend loved it for Christmas and it works perfectly too ! ! !
5 #### I had the normal fuses installed on my sound system in my car when one day my system stopped working . its time to investigate ... the first thing I do is check the fuses and i opened my hood of the car just the see that my normal fuse and fuse holder MELTED ! ! so i said to myself its time to get a anl fuse and fuse holder . i ve had this in my car for a month now and i have not had any problems yet but we will see in the future . it did n't make a difference in sound but I m just hoping it does nt melt like my previous fuse holder ..
5 #### I absolutely love these strings ! I could n't ask for better tone or response :)
3 #### My mother - in - law loves these . Every time we buy something and are just missing that free shipping mark we get her a pair . They do n't last long and have pretty poor sound quality but they are comfortable .
4 #### if you put your phone in it while the phone is on the heat from the device will create a little condensation inside . guess that means it is watertight and as advertised
4 #### Wheel chocks are a must for every Rver . This is of particular importance if you use the tri - leveler or other similar device .
5 #### Looks great , performs well . easy to install -- look ar Dan Erline book for proper use of string trees in Fender guitar guitars
4 #### seems to sag a bit . works ok . rotates and extends smoothly ,
5 #### This was a direct replacement of my trailers factory 5 ( 4+ground ) wire plug . All the wires were long enough to run new if needed but i only had to go the end of the Tongue . The only thing i had to keep was the original white wire for the ground since it was short ( 3 feet ? ) and mine was grounded at the end of the trailer tongue ( see pics )
5 #### These are great screen protectors ! They are cut out perfect for the phone and easy to apply ! it comes with 3 for a great price . I 'd recommend these protectors to anyone .
5 #### these things muffle sound great . they have good sound quality . perfect for recording loud drums . perfect for drowning out people
5 #### Very comfortable , I forget that they 're on sometimes . Occasionally I throw them on and it feels like they 're pressing on my ear , but just take a sec to adjust them , then they are fine for hours ( or days , but I have n't worn them for days ) . The way they fold up is pretty good , but I was n't able to get them into the bag easily . The case is more a bag then a case . Volume is good with them too . I have n't checked sound quality much other than everyday listening . I 'd expect them to be fantastic in that category as well . Worth the 32 dollars that I paid , and probably would 've accepted a larger price if I could n't wait .
5 #### Strong , Long and dose the job . Love the key no way anyone will ever pick this lock .
3 #### This is a soft case to enclose an outer cover . I did not realize . My bad .
5 #### I 'm an acoustic guy but I 've gotten into home audio recording . I needed a serviceable electric and this axe fits the niche . This is a good , midrange instrument . A really nice guitar for a beginner , and a decent instrument for the intermediate player . String action was very good , and can be adjusted with provided tools . Fit and finish is pretty good . I admit , I 'm a guitar snob , and the Squire logo is gross , but this is n't a gigging guitar its an electric guitar that stays in tune for adding parts to my songs . There are differences between this guitar and the standard ( MIM ) and American Telecaster , mainly string setup , woods , finish and most importantly pickups . This guitar sounds like a Telecaster , it 's not too thin and has the twang that Tele 's are known for . In my opinion , Tele 's are very versatile instruments . I strung mine with 12 's as I do n't care for 9 's . I do n't have any trouble with bends . I made a few , minute adjustments to the string action due to increased string gauge . I recommend this guitar .
5 #### I have put these on all my guitars , and even have an extra for when I add a new guitar to my collection . Easy to use and pretty stylish . I have some in black and silver .
3 #### I just bought this 4 days ago . Once I opened the box the product looked like an used one . I am seeing lots of scratch marks in the black rubber which should not be in a new one which obviously I ordered . The headset charges and performs as found in anyother review here . Why am I probably shipped an used headset while I ordered a new one ? ? ?
5 #### Great product ; it just works and you ca n't beat the price ! Bought this for my mother , who used it until she wore out the connectors . Until then , she used it daily and excessively ( she 's a talker ... to say the least ) . Recommended !
5 #### The cable is of good quality wire , and the connectors are well constructed . Very simply , this connector will not introduce hum or noise into your setup . Highly recommended .
5 #### Just another toy to dress up the pickup . Not really needed , but nice to have .
1 #### IF YOU WEAR THIS DEVICE , YOU WILL HEAVE YOUR EARS BLISTER OR TURN RED . IT HURT SO BAD AFTER A FEW MINUTES WEARING IT . I HAVE TO ADMIT , IT LOOK LIKE THE 60 STYLE EAR MUFF
5 #### I got just what I wanted from this zoom lens .
5 #### I 've used a lot of Loctite 515 over the years as a professional diesel mechanic and shipboard engineer . This is a great product .
3 #### Maybe it is my computer but the sound is average
5 #### Have been using this tool for years , it stays on on my keychain . None better
5 #### Product arrived on time and as advertised . useful charging option .
5 #### Been using this product on the plastic windows of the soft top on our now 16 year old Mercedes SL . It 's kept those plastic windows clean , even in the hot South where we live ! One application a year seems perfect for us . Love this product !
5 #### I play guitar as well as doing all the maintenance myself . When I would change the strings I would pretty much just get some cheapo strings since I 'm only practicing . You could easily find a pack of 6 guitar strings for about $ 5 . Once I began to try violin I noticed that under $ 10 would be a miracle . I do n't really know much about violin at this point , but I can tell that the strings are of good quality and should last for awhile .
4 #### Good design , especially the earpiece but sometimes the audio quality is terrible . I use it just when I drive and it is good enough for me .
3 #### I have few friends and colleagues that ca n't speak up on the phone and I was really hoping that this headset had the awesomely loud speaker that my wife 's Motorola does . It did not meet that expectation . It was , however , very easy to set up and works well otherwise .
5 #### Looked for these for a long time . Finally got a great deal and used them on my Motorola phones . Superb .
1 #### the case it self is nice , if it would only last . the part that attaches to your belt is not solid and tore apart after about a month of use . I do not consider a product " premium " as the title suggests if the seams rip apart after normal use in a month .
5 #### Used in my " workshop " building - it 's portable for an RV as the title states but can be used to boost the signal anywhere . It 's perfect for the building where I had to be outside and walk around to get a signal . With this I have 2 bars , sometimes 3 , inside . It has the base and is approx . 20 ft high - I 'm going to put it on the roof I think ( since I 'm not using it for travel at this time ) , just to try and bring in stronger service . What impressed me most was the instructions . You can actually view installation online but I just read them and it was laid out . It tells you parts and what to do before even unpacking so you know what 's what . In this day and age of 5 languages and/or simplistic stick figures - I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with their attention to detail and helping the customer . It 's a pricey item though - but if you live remote as I do , you 'll try anything . Will keep you updated !
5 #### No complaints with this order . I ordered them because the multimeter I bought only had pointy leads , and these are helpful for hands - free measurement
1 #### these people steal from customers . They sell refurbished , used cell phones when you paid for a NEW one .
4 #### It does what it needs to do . My only complaint is the awkward layout of the power inlet at the back- thus you end up with cables at the front and at the back making locating the unit a bit troublesome .
4 #### I recently purchase this bluetooth for 12 bucks from Amazon . It 's a great price for a basic bluetooth . I personally do not care all the fancy features that higher priced models have , I 'm sure they are nice and may come in handy from time to time but I rather save the 60 dollars . It 's very easy to do the initial set - up and to operate it . Uses one button for all the funtions , such as answering a call , redialing last number , voice dialing ( only if your phone has that feature)or rejecting a call and has separate volume buttons . It 's very clear at both ends , nobody has complained of not being able to hear me clearly . The bluetooth itself is very nice looking , small , light and it fit my ear perfectly . I would have givin this bluetooth 5 stars if it was n't for the packaging , I was not aware the Bulk Packaging meant Amazon would put the headset in a sandwich bag with a bad photo copy of the instructions which were barely readable almost if I had gotten from a Craker Jack 's box . But I guess if it saves you a couple bucks . I was so impressed with the headset that a bought 2 more pieces but from Newegg price was better and the packaging was more proffesional , it had a way better version of instructions .
5 #### I gifted my first set and have had mixed feelings about that ever since . Got these at $ 50 ( which is an absolute steal ) but would heartily recommend for $ 90 . Great neutral sound . Accommodating cord . Love these cans !
1 #### Did nothing to solve the shudder problem . So I checked with Lubegard and they said it was compatible with my transmission ( i.e ... should work ) . I drained the fluid and installed AMSOIL high MPG and the shudder problem went away . So you have to wonder what in this product ?
3 #### The first one lasted one week before the left side started to buzz and rattle . The second attempt came about seven months later . I have had it for about a month now and it is holding up quite well . These headphones have pronounced highs and lows which I think is great for the FLAC Rock I like to listen to in my recliner . Some people say these are exactly like the Sony MDR7506 . There is a difference in the specs . Sony MDR7506 have a Frequency Response of 10Hz - 20 kHz . The MDRV6 have a Frequency Response of 5Hz - 30 kHz .
2 #### They 're inexpensive enough and are better than the vintage style trees , but since they do n't roll and are n't graphite , they require lubricating every time you change strings . I should have just bought the Tusq ones .
5 #### I had a concern that perhaps I did n't spend enough to get a good unit . However the Generic drive has proven to be a fine unit . Super easy to set up and use . I 'm satisfied with it in every way .
3 #### This is my first time trying Elixir strings . I m a huge Martin Life Span strings . These strings did compare to their martin counter parts . But had several advantages and disadvantages that I noticed . A major advantage that I loved about these strings was the smoothness . The strings are slick , and when sliding up and down the frets is almost perfectly silent . Another advantage was the packing , individual packaging per string was nice . Something I dislike about these strings is that they sound great when played individually and picking . But when strumming the quality of their sound greatly diminishes . So My final conclusion and the reason for my score is very personal . I love chords and strumming more so than picking , and i find that Martin strings have better tone with strumming than these strings . If I was a huge picker I would stay with these strings . All in all still a good set of strings . Note : I only have 10 hours of play time on these strings . If they warm up to the guitar I will change my review .
4 #### I like the product but there was not enough in the bottle to fully finish the third coat
5 #### We camp every month and it is a challenge keeping electronic devices like phones and iPads charged through the weekend . In the woods you seldom have access to a wall outlet , and the solar charger seems good just for a 75 % charge on one device . Memorial weekend I took the Trent : iTorch IMP52D - ( 5200mAh ) that I had charged the prior week . It was small and sleek and easy to pack or pocket . It charged my iPhone twice and still had 50 % power come Monday morning . Small enough to fit in your hand , but not at all wimpy , it feels very solid and able to stand up to heavy use . While it did not come with a wall adapter , the iCarrier that I bought at the same time did and it is interchangeable , otherwise you can use your device charger and its USB cable . The product is simple and easy to use , no need to pack an instruction book , which is a bonus when you want to travel light . The added flashlight and laser pointer are just icing on the cake . I ca n't wait to take this and the iCarrier IMP120D - ( 12000mAh ) charger for a week long summer camp . I 'm sure I will be supplying energy for my entire troop .
4 #### Very dense and cut very well . Used with Presta gelcoat compound on my boat . Must be used with Makita backplate and centered properly ( the tool was provided with my Makita 9227CX3 ) .
5 #### These sound great . I have much more headphones that did not come close to the performance these deliver .
5 #### I bought this strap 20 years ago and still going strong .
5 #### I love the weight of this thing . The grip is really nice , too , and allows for a couple different holds .
2 #### this head set works like it says it does , but it is cheply made and no good for motorcycle use .
2 #### The lock is sharp and is uncomfortable to handle . The key is tinier than the tip of your index finger . I almost lost one already . Because the key is so tiny it makes unlocking this difficult . I much prefer the master lock key and cable .
4 #### Good quality low price power center with noise filter . This power center has good outlet spacing allowing for transformers to fit without covering outlets as some power centers have not incorporated this design causing loss of total number of available outlets .
5 #### Love the Zip drive , Yes I 'm old school but I have dozens of zip disks from my work years back and needed this to transfer my work . Works great .
3 #### I ordered this kit as it is necessary to maintain the K&N filter that comes with the K&N Cold Air Kit and in fact this recharge kit should be a part of the cold air kit even if they have to adjust the price to ship it with the cold air kit . If not used then the buyer has wasted the price he paid for the cold air kit and will most likely experience problems and or damage to their vehicle
4 #### I 've tried about five adapters . The issue is , on an Audi A8 from 1998 , there is not low fill port for the AC . And even though the sensor valve ( some have sensors attached , some do not ) looks like an AC low pressure fill , it 's not . The threads are NOT an R12 conversion , so if you buy and R12 to R134a adapter , you 'll just strip the threads trying to put the adapter on because the port is larger than R12 . This adapter fits . The threads are loose , so I suggest you get some Pipe Tape - The White Stuff that plumbing stores sell to wrap around threads on water and gas pipes to seal them . Wrap a strip of tape around the threads about five times and then thread on this adapter . Make sure you seat it all the way down - NOT TOO TIGHT but tight enough to stop any leaks . You will have to be patient on the fill as it takes a wile . Run the AC compressor . Tip the can from 12:00 to 3:00 once every 10 seconds or so until it is empty . You 'll get it . Hey , would you rather spend a few bucks on this and 10 bucks for a can of 134a , or would you rather pay Audi 300 bucks for a recharge ? Glad I found this adapter .
4 #### This was a really nice phone cover . Good price , good fit on all parts of the phone , and looked good on the phone as well .
2 #### The 11 " is the length and the width is only 9 " . Too small for a 1500,2500 , or3500 to fit right
5 #### Great to read other buyers otherwise i would never know to get this connector as the pump fitting was for different gauges .
4 #### Wow ! This heartwarming love story kept getting better every chapter I read . The author is wonderfully talented . I would have rated this 5 stars except for the cuss words . It 's beyond disgusting when authors take God 's name in vain .
5 #### It is well made , soft flexible material instead of cheesy hard plastic . The length is about right for a patch cord .
5 #### Heavy Duty Large Slim Horizontal Smart Phones Cell Phone Universal Case/ Pouch/ Holster with Velcro , Metal Clip and Belt Loop . I was completely shocked at how well built and sturdy this case is . The metal belt clip is awesome .
3 #### These Binoculars received this rating because of what I was expecting . They are much heavier than I expected and holding them steady creates a major problem . I am looking for a tripod / mount to steady the glasses , yet provide flexibility to view overhead . The other reason I did not rate these binoculars higher is because the focusing is very difficult . Because my eyes are not the same , focusing for one eye causes a problem for the other . I have tried following the instructions by focusing for the left eye first , then adjust the eye piece for the right . When I try to adjust the right eye piece , the entire focus unit moves . Also had problem adjusting eye width to obtain one circle . Another problem I 'm having is that the focus adjustment changes on its own , kinda like creeps while viewing , and needs continuous adjustment . I have other sets of binoculars , 7x35 & 10x50 and do not have these same type problems .
5 #### Its what I wanted and came right away and it worked and fit and fast shipment . thanks and I will be purchasing from here again if needed .
2 #### Do n't buy this , get a 283/285HV instead . It powers down after 5mins , when you 're least expecting it . I 've missed so many shots because the flash was not ready when I was . Poor design feature which can not be overridden .
1 #### Pictures would have you believe this a near mil - spec case , protecting your phone from shock , moisture and dirt . Not even close . Specifics ... Once assembled around the phone , the unit easily falls out of included belt clip . The two little ears on the belt clip do not securely hold the phone and case in place . At best , this is a case you store in your pocket or purse , although the case makes the phone quite bulky . With the phone in the case , the charge cord can not be connected , or at least we ca n't get any of the multiple chargers we own to work ( we own 11 I Phones ) . The outer rubber housing , meant to absorb shock is thin ... far thinner than standard Otter Box soft phone cases and the inner yellow shell is made of hard , unyielding plastic , so I doubt if this case offers much real protection if your IPhone is dropped from any height . This is one , poorly conceived design meant , I suspect to look tough but not much else . The Otterbox Defender Series 3 case fails in every way and given how poorly it performs , it is grossly overpriced to boot .
5 #### Fits my 3 g slide perfectly . Picture is a little different from the actual product as the top part of the cover comes down over the white portion . This actually works better for me as along with protecting the phone I wanted to cover up most of the white phone . Hard case with a sort of a velvety feel to it .
5 #### who is editing my reviews down to one or two words ? DONT contact me again asking for reviews if your going to change them Write them yourself . FO !
5 #### These coated strings eliminate the " squeeks " and provide sharp clear notes . They have been on several months and still look brand new . Just be sure you wipe them down after you play .
1 #### It worked great for 2 days , then completely died . Wo n't charge or turn on at all . I never dropped it or abused in any way , it was hardly used . Poor quality . Do not buy this .
5 #### This is a great lens and is much less expensive than the " retail box " version . Who should care about the beauty of the box that they will likely discard anyway ? =) Here is my exhaustive review of this lens http://goo.gl/8XpoKO . It 's important to note that this lens does not have image stabilization ( " IS " ) . If you use a tripod like I do then that is likely of little value anyway . I use this lens when I 'm photographing nature and/or boats from far away . A quality telephoto lens such as this one should be a core component of everyone 's DSLR travel backpack .
5 #### I have a 2008 , Ford F150 FX2 Sport , Supercab . I had never done anything with sound , to any vehicle I had ever owned , that was so extensive . I am so glad I did . I absolutely love this stuff and will probably put it in any vehicle I own , whether I do a sound system or not . It just quiets things down . It gets a bit sticky at times but comes right off your fingers . Be careful with small pieces that you want to throw away , they may end up back on the bottom of your foot . It took me a solid weekend to do the front to the back and doors . If you have the time , do it .
5 #### Good quality stylus pens . I do n't need all 3 but I 'm happy with the purchase . Works great for my kindle fire .
5 #### I purchased a set of powered theater seats that would recline at a push of a button . Unfortunately they did n't work properly . What has that got to do with the Monster Cable PowerCenter ? Well the manufacturer of the chairs said that something one the electrical circuit for my chairs was causing the problem . Well guess what , it was . By running a 100 ft cord to another area in my home , I was able to solve the problem . That was n't a good solution , so I tried the Monster Cable PowerCenter . It solved the problem . The same holds true with your remote controls , audio , video equipment and DVR . Yes a lot of the issue you maybe having are caused by dirty power . The Monster Cable provides clean power which makes everything work better .
4 #### Ok but nothing special I really ca n't say good or bad its just personal preference and this just was n't for me . It did meet the advertised info .
5 #### Great oiler ! I had always seen these things here and there and now I understand why everyone has this style of oiler . I 've been using mine with WD40 standard lubricant / penetrant with no issues at all . No leaks even when I accidentally tip the can over . I really like the bendable spout . The oil comes out in a tight stream that can actually be " shot " at a decent distance if you squeeze the oil tab hard enough . Storage can be a little weird as I carry a maintenance kit in the back of my Jeep at all times . It 's like a little antenna sticking out . But that 's no big deal . I would recommend , especially for the low price !
5 #### THE BEST FINAL GLAZING PUTTY I EVER USED SMOOTH AS GLASS ON FINAL FINISH AND IS REALLY HARD ..
1 #### My Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder would n't connect using this cable . I purchased a Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder along with this Belkin F3U134 - 10 USB Extension Cable . My computer ( Dell running XP Pro ) would n't recognize the USB device ( Flip Ultra ) using this cable . The Flip connected immediately when plugged directly into the USB port . Belkin is a reputable supplier but this cable got just 1 star for my application .
5 #### Get these binoculars , if you can afford them . I have looked at , or through , Zeiss and Leicas , and the Canon 's are of equal quality . The image stabilization works , period . You can see detail that is NOT possible without IS . Also , the binoculars are very usable without the IS feature , more so than I would have thought . My suggestion , buy the highest magnification that will fit your application , since IS gives the greatest benefit at higher powers .
5 #### The kids more it all around . For game playing . And its holding up .The price what good . Very happy with .
3 #### This is a beautiful device ; small , convenient . Unfortunately , it has failed in less than a year . It was an excellent charger for travel , and used for Palm and other phones . I particularly liked the long cord ; very convenient .
5 #### Sound good on my acoustic guitars . I have favored these strings since I started playing over 50 years ago .
5 #### My daughter was excited to open and put these strings to use . Easy to tune , and they " feel great " on her fingers .
3 #### Some might like the design but I did n't . I ca n't comment about the durability because I replaced them in a few months . The low E , A , D , and G string sound tinny and artificial . The coating on these strings makes slides easier , but the downside is there is very little friction and the string feel slippery under your fingers , may not be a problem for some people . I find this especially problematic for pull offs .
5 #### I have been very pleased with all of the D'Addario strings that I have purchased over the years . For me , these are the number one guitar string for electric guitars across the board .
1 #### I found that the note attack was crap unless I kept the compression all the way down . In the end I sold the pedal within a month of purchase . The Joyo compressor might be a better option to maximize your control .
5 #### It was plug in and play simple . Just how I hoped it would work .
5 #### Charges fast and and stays charged for a while , has plenty capabilities and looks good , too . Also fits comfortably in the ear .
5 #### A perfect match for the original I replaced . These fit the American sized pots perfectly . The price at Amazon was the best I could find without buying used crap .
5 #### i like this product . i am actually currently using this . i like that it works with my phone and i have signal all the time
5 #### I just use it for the FM radio feature , , , Music , weather ect . ... Sounds real good .... The only problem I have with it is , I keep losing the cap on the end . In my case it does n't hurt the quality or the sound , but does make it look a little worse ....
1 #### I like the case , card slots are only for one or two cards , so keep that in mind if you plan to use them . Their customer service is second to none ! Now that I 've used the case for several months , I have to say that I 'm not impressed with it . The plastic that surrounds and holds the phone in the case had broken off on both sides on top . There is no protection for the plastic , so if you plan to carry it in a pocket as I do , I would look at a different product .
5 #### Great deal on these batteries . So far I have no issue with it . The ones I received are all good and work as expected . Much better deal than my neighborhood R.Shack store .
5 #### Have several Rovners , but this is a favorite . Easy to place . I use Vandoren and Rico mpcs . With 1.5 to 2.0 reeds
5 #### Elixeers string are by far the best on the market in my opion . I use them on all of my string interments
3 #### ... as I recall . It was a bit slippery . But functioned well , and saved my phone from damage on a few drops .
5 #### I 've had digital music keyboards that had options for analog or digital control of volume directly through foot pedals , but my Privia PX-3 does n't accommodate either solution . Enter the Boss Stereo Volume Pedal . Connections are made from the L / R line outputs of the keyboard to the pedal . Then from the pedal outputs to the amplifier(s ) . It works perfectly without any other setup . The pedal action is just stiff enough so it holds position if you move your foot off the pedal , and the volume limiter knob ensures you wo n't accidentally cut off all sound . There is an " out " for a tuner but that 's not particularly useful for a keyboardist . Note : You want the " low impedance " version for keyboards - FV-50L. The FV-50H ( high impedance ) is for use with guitars . ( There 's also a more expensive version with a metal case - FV-500L. )
5 #### Most of us have old VHS tapes in the closet and the VP-100 keeps your VCR delievering a clean image . What more can I say --- it works !
1 #### Wish I read the reviews here more completely . This was a complete piece of trash . Like with others , the speaker would not play for more than 30 seconds at a time no matter what I did . After a while I could feel that the speaker was over heating so I left it unplugged . Sure enough it came back and played for another 30 seconds and then quit . It 's going back to Amazon immediately !
5 #### Worked perfect . The tools included were exactly what i needed to get the phone apart and back together . I did n't realize the two brown things were actually the " glue pads " that hold the digitizer in . I thought i would have to go rednect with some silicone adhesive or something . This really had everything i needed for the complete repair .
5 #### Great set of Field Glasses . Not too much to say here , they just work . Can see quite far easily with these Binoculars . I use these mostly for Camping / Hiking and sightseeing . Probably not as good compared to some 500 dollar glasses , but for my basic purposes they fit the bill . Seems durable , but I wo n't risk tossing them around like a football to find out . All in all , good purchase at a great price .
1 #### This seemed so cool when I first got it .. This piece of crap lasted two gigs ! the bottom of the small cymbal compartment separated first . Last night at my second gig with it ? The zipper tongue fell off ! wow . Never had a product fail this fast in my life . Really disappointed . All within 9 days . On a good note , the vendor , music 123 took it back and credited me in a timely manner . Very good store and recently made another from them through amazon .
5 #### Everything Radial makes is great ! If you did n't know that , now you do . I really love the flexibility to merge inputs , and the 2 levels of padding , but the Jensen transformer is a sweet addition to the signal chain .
5 #### I went from Remo Pinstripe ( for the dampening ring ) , to Evans 360 ( for attack ) , to Aquarian PF series for deep tone / damped sound . The Aquarian most suits my needs for playing classic country and old rock and roll . Deep warm tone without need for any gels or damping rings , that tend to get mashed or fall off in transit ( as I have quit using gig bags ) . I was seeking to keep my volume down , hitting softly and still getting deep drum tones ... they deliver in spades . Great heads , and a good match for the Aquarian Focus X on my snare drum .
5 #### Belkin makes top notch products and this 6 ' Firewire 400 cable is no exception . I 've used this with an external RAID1 as well as an Apogee Duet Firewire audio interface . The cable performed excellently in both applications .
5 #### Arrived quickly . Able to go 2 - 3 times longer before charging . Very happy with the results .
5 #### This is awesome and it also has svideo too unlike my original cable . Works pretty well . And super cheap too .
5 #### Very useful tool when you have any model iphone when you want to remove or replace sim card tray and was really cheap .
5 #### These items are perfect for there intended use . I was able to get them at a substantial savings buying them here over buying them at a Cell phone store
5 #### These were just what that used bike needed to dress it up a little .
4 #### Simple and stable design . Wide palm rest , very natural and comfortable feel . Wish there were back and forward buttons . Many options for configuring pointer movement and actions . Battery cover difficult to open , was concerned about breaking it . Make sure to position the receiver with ample open space around it ( not next to other devices ) , or mouse movements may be erratic .
5 #### OK ... I read the reviews and thought , " Just how good can $ 4.50 headphones be ? These reviewers are getting a little carried away ... " But I needed cheap disposable ' phones for work . So , what the heck . I bought them . I was wrong . these headphones are awesome ! They sound better than my expensive headphones I use at home . Run ... do not walk ... and buy a pair . Heck , I am buying everyone these ' phones as stocking stuffers for Christmas . Fantastic product .
4 #### I like these reeds . I get plenty of good reeds out of a box . I also like the Evolution reeds . Worth a try ! If you prefer filed reeds , try the thick blank version . Rico has totally stepped up their reed selection and quality over the past several years !
5 #### i 'm running a 3rd party ROM ( cyanogenmod ) which is cupcake plus some donut , on my HTC dream , and it works for me . i tried the 3.5 mm port , and the USB headset port while charging and all is good . no headset switching software . IMO , this thing is too big to use as a simple 3.5 mm < - > USB adapter while mobile . if you need that , buy one that is dedicated to that purpose . this one is good when you are stationary , and you want to charge / listen to headset at the same time .
4 #### nice for the price it figs my new mustang ok no problems
5 #### That was the first time I installed a Starter and I was very satisfied I was able to identify the wirings . Their website somehow has a compilation of color - coded wirings for every car / year . It was very helpful including the installation videos on the net . I noticed that there is a connector in my car where those little wirings seems to converge to . This connector is not connected to any . It must be for the T - harness they call it . I might have installed it easily if I have it . I have a car manual and I can read diagrams so it helped a lot in the installation . The only cons : The LED tester that came with it was defective . It only light up RED on positive hit only ! So I used a VOM for the Negatives . Tested it at more than 400 ft unobstructed , signal is capable . From inside the building to the parking lot- it did nt . Overall , I AM SATISFIED with this starter . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ UPDATE October 2015 Its almost 4 years now and it has no problem at all . It functions just like i first bought it . Will update this reviews again in the near future .
1 #### Have purchased several through the last few years and never had a problem ... until now . Bought in August to put on our RZR - Due to ynforeseen circumstances the RZR was broke down and this horn probly went on three rides - the last one after the repair was done and needed to use the horn and it does n't work . Took off - bench tested and it toast . Came back here to see policies , side note - bought it at the end of august - no return available after October 8th ... That 's like a one month warranty - unacceptable .
5 #### These came with my Taylor acoustic and I bought another pair because I thought they sounded great . Price was better than in store so I 'm satisfied .
5 #### This will always be a contender in my arsenal of products . 2 coats and you can be sure your car will be at its best
5 #### The best I 've used for classical music . I 'd buy them again .
5 #### Excellent base , fidelity and lightweight comfort at a very low price . For TV and computer video sound and on - the - go mp3 listening , I do n't need anything more . Of course , for high fidelity musical listening at home , I go with higher end headphones .
1 #### What a disappointment . The battery cover does not work on a eTrex Venture CX model . What a disappointment . The CX has a flash card slot on the upper left which requires a notch in the cover . This one does not have the notch so it will not fit . I also do not have the o - ring mentioned by the other reviewer so I am not sure if it will seal 100 % on regular units anyway . What a bummer I threw away the packaging before I actually tried to mount it on the bicycle anyway . What a bummer .
5 #### I am pleased with the phone . I bought this for my wife to carry to work . When she comes home it is usually very cold and I wanted her to have a phone to use if she needed to call for help . This one is priced right and came with No contract . I will buy minutes every three months , cheap to buy , cheap to use .
5 #### I used to use Techron for years to keep my internals running clean but this product does so much more and you can add it to your crankcase as well .
1 #### Not a true 2.1A charger . If you are going on an 8 hour trip it might charge your ipad but do n't expect to be able to listen to it at the same time .
4 #### This is an excellent product . I use on indoor and outdoor teak furniture . This product is better priced by a long shot than buying at the local Danish furniture retailer .
5 #### D - Link has continued to be one of the major contenders in the computer parts and peripheral industry . Their products are always top of the line . I have used them for years and will continue to .
1 #### Good quality build , and a charging capacity that is better than cheap USB 12v chargers . Update 2016- . This charger , when compared to another brand I recently purchased off Amazon , does not provide enough amperage to positively charge a smart phone while it 's in use . Or a dash cam . While rated for 2.1 amps , it performs poorly and bordering defective compared to another on the same 12v power source . I do n't know why , but when I replaced it everything charged correctly . Watch out .
5 #### I got tired of removing the rear cover and battery just to get to the SD card to put in my computer . Now I can just plug in the cable and access all of the files on my phone with ease .
3 #### Was fun for literatly 5 minutes , but I really had no special projects to use it for , so its sitting in a box . I only bought it from overpriced Amazon because I had a giftcard . Buy online for $ 25 from manufacturer . Also this is lagggyyyy , but what would you expect with the specs .
5 #### I use d'addario phosphor bronze and the 80/20s as well after trying so many . Then this John pearse phosphor bronze got me curious . It is a very good string .
3 #### Image quality and stabilization are exceptional but I ca n't recommend this purchase due to the absolute failure on Canon for fit and finish . Eye pieces . Very hard to adjust eye width . You need both hands and it is very stiff . The eye pieces have lens covers but they do n't stay on . The eye piece rubber is very hard and in order to get a single view you have to mash the eye cups into your eyes which is very uncomfortable . You can cut them but why should you have to on such an expensive piece of gear ? The main lens elements do not have lens covers . Really ? For this amount of money this should come with lens covers The carry case . It 's garbage . An otherwise great set of glasses ruined by no attention to detail and poor choices in the fit and finish .
1 #### Does n't hold the iphone in a steady position . The arm is very weak and wants to fall over constantly . The iphone must be right on top of the radio to transmit and it 's a weak signal at that . Would not recommend to anyone .
5 #### Great price and great strings . my local guitar store has never had these in stock and I have always want to try these and see how much of a difference these make in sound as compared to the nickle plated strings .
5 #### This is a great mount . It hold either iPhone 3 or 4 easily and securely in any orientation , releases easily , and has 2 mounts-- a gizmo that grips onto vent openings , and a suction cup mount that has a vacuum lever on it to make it really grip . The mount itself has a passive sound amplifier-- basically like a mini - megaphone which ingeniously fits over the iPhone 's speakers . It 's not dramatic , but it really does increase the sound volume , and is a nice free extra to an already good mount .
4 #### Very good sound . I use them mainly to listen to podcasts on my telephone and I can usually have the volume quite low without background noise interfering with my listening . They can get painful if I am wearing them for a few hours , though .
1 #### Not very clear to see , and it broke around 30 mph .
5 #### Why this is item is so useful ? . Just try it and lost it after using for a while , you will miss it .
5 #### One word , AMAZING .. Wish the cord was n't sooooo long but wow do these sound super nice . You hear details in the music that you have n't heard before . Nice audition to any true audio enthusiast ... Get them!'n
5 #### Great battery . I did received this item for free for my unbias review .
3 #### mud guard fit good and looks good . they are designed to fit most any truck . I would recommend this product
5 #### Used it as under hood insulation on my dodge cummins diesel to replace the ratty under hood insulation mice kept tearing apart . My recommendation is to heat up the adhesive a little bit so that it sticks better . Keeps my hood nice and cool and will save my clear coat . I am going to use the same stuff as a starter heat shield .
5 #### Fixed my own BlackBerry Curve , yeah , I did ! Good little smart phone , I simply wore out ... now , good as new .
5 #### The merchandise arrived on time and I am very happy with it .
4 #### We use this with a Blackberry Curve and it works great . Sound quality on calls is great and I have n't noticed any issues with call volume while driving or outside like some other reviews suggested . Not the coolest looking bluetooth headset but works well .
5 #### this charger is perfect for my nook hd plus , as everybody knows , the only chargers that work on the nooks are the nook charger . it works fine for me .
5 #### Purchased this instrument for my 87 year old Dad and he loves playing it .
5 #### Never has it been so easy to unload rocks and dirt from my truck bed . Installation is quick and simple .
4 #### Seems fairly stout and for the Money worth it . Not a load bar but it helps keep things from sliding around .....
4 #### Arrived on time . Work as expected . Keeps the contacts clean .
5 #### I had settled on the .88 green Tortex picks for years but recently decided to try Ultex . These have a bit brighter sound to my ear than the Tortex , which seem to dampen the notes more when I compare them . I find the .73s good for single notes and strumming alike .
5 #### here again OEM fit for my RV to the same part number saveing me over $ 50 from what the dealer ask
4 #### Its ok . But its not polished chrome like the photo . It has a " frosty " finish so it wo n't show fingerprints or light damage as easily . Also the top / crown swivels 360 degrees but does not detach as I thought . So its not good for spinning for speedy head changes . I got a " used " deal or I would have been disappointed by giving full price .
5 #### Easy to use Great quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand . Thank you very much
1 #### Did not work , it did not stay erect due to the weight of the phone and the transmitter stop working 3 days after opening from the box . I kept it in my vehicle to use it as a charger but never really used it ...
5 #### It 's almost 8 months and 13,000 miles after I detailed my car this stuff now . All I can say is how incredible it is . The car still cleans easily in a touch - less car wash , bugs and tar do n't stick like they used to and water still beads up .
5 #### I live an a weak signal area for AT&T. Before using the Cell Ranger I could not get a signal in my yard . Not , depending on my location in the yard or driveway , I can get 3 - 4 bars ! I usually have to be less than 4 feet from the Cell Ranger though , like sitting in my car or truck with the Cell Ranger plugged in .
4 #### This stuff works perfect for my firewall in my Jeep , sticks well and molds to about any bump or hump . I would buy again but just wish I recieved more material for the money .
5 #### It fits my 2016 Mazda 3 2.5 Liter engine fine with no leaks .
5 #### Nice value , works great . I use it in combination with the ' HumX - EdTech ' , and my amp hum and buzz are gone .
4 #### Fit is n't quite as smooth as stock but once the phone is reassembled you ca n't tell it from the original . If you have a broken iPhone screen this is a good way to fix it - just pay close attention to the how - to videos on youtube and you 'll be fine .
5 #### I was skeptical about this purchase in that I was n't sure it would really help me repair my Blackberry Storm ( screen replacement) .... it came promptly and was the exact thing for the job .
5 #### Your standard power strip , with surge protection . Does the job , outlets are n't inaccessible and plugs go in just fine . Colors are a bit obnoxious and the labels are completely unnecessary if you need this for other applications , but it works just fine . And it comes with a rounded plug that stays out of the way and does n't obscure more than one outlet .
5 #### very durable , water tight , use this in my backpack to keep medical supplies dry , the clamps hold tight with a solid click when shut
5 #### This cable allowed me to connect my PC with my internet modem , at higher velocities than my wireless card does .
4 #### This is a sleek case . It 's pretty , but hard plastic , no slight rubberized texture like similar ones . So when I 'm driving it often slides out of my lap or off the center console . Otherwise , its an attractive case , fits the device well . I 've dropped it and it does n't come off or break .
5 #### The AKG K 240S is the replacement for the K240M. Impedance has been reduced from 600 ohms to 55 ohms . Bass response has been extended and midrange is flatter in response . Consider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II package and you will have spare cord and spare earpads .
5 #### Fits well on 1995 Ford F150 4x4 with the Dana 44 . My rusty but trusty .
5 #### I went to a local store and was able to fit the new Lumix GF1 +20 mm lens into this bag ! it is a bit tight at first but it stretches nicely after a few uses .
3 #### This product helps to control the " ringing " that is present in a bass drum . It will not make the drum sound " deeper " like a feather pillow . The attachments are ( 2 ) strips of velcro that did not stick to the inside of my wood drum ; so the item came loose after a week and was floating around inside the drum . It is also a bit lighter than i expected , but it will do the job in giving you control of your sound and looks better than an old pillow or towel . For that deeper sound , I changed out the single 7mil head and ordered a double ply 7mil head and that did the trick to deliver the solid deep sound that I was after .
4 #### After just buying a new Canon Power Shot Camera , we wanted the cable that would allow us to view the video clips directly from the camera to our HD TV . This was the HDMI cable we needed . The price was far below the Canon cord and this one has worked great for us . The delivery was much faster than we expected , so we were delighted with that , as well .
4 #### Fit only so - so , pressure adjustment flimsy . Sound quality very good but not outstanding ; sound leaks very noticeable .
5 #### This damper really gives you that sweet , tight bass drum thump without all those overtones . Great idea . Well constructed and priced well .
5 #### What can I say . Works exactly as it should nice bright color so you ca n't forget them . Great price . Hope I do n't need to order more .
5 #### I love these things . Incredibly flat response , great for mixing live or in the studio . Great for listening to music on my mp3 player . Excellent build quality .
5 #### Superb quality as expected , if you 're familiar with this brand then you know what it 's all about , could n't ask for more . Thank you Amazon for selling professional music gear on your site . I dread the thought of stopping in my local Guitar Center to buy anything . Anyone that 's had that experience knows what I 'm talking about . Received it in just a couple days in flawless condition right to my door . No traveling around and haggling with vultures who work off of a commission .
4 #### Good deal , for the price , not heavy duty but works for me .
5 #### Good quality . Make sure any battery you buy on - line has an experation date !
3 #### I 've owned a total of FOUR of these cases for my iPhone 4 ( they 've all broken ) . It 's a great case until it starts the break . The vented sides of the case get brittle and will separate eventually not holding onto the phone very well . Once broken , you can submit the case to iFrogz / ZAGG for repair . I 've had great luck with this procedure until my most recent repair claim . I had two of these cases that broke . I followed the warranty repair instructions posted on the iFrogz site to send the two cases back along with proof of purchase . Meanwhile , ZAGG took over . When my cases were received , they logged only a single case ( not two ) in their system and sent me back a single new one . I emailed their support reps and was told they only received a single case and they were n't willing to replace the other case since i did n't follow the new procedure ZAGG posted on the new site . Yet i sent proof of purchase for BOTH cases ? After this experience , i 'm done with ZAGG and iFrogz . Loving my new Diztronic case !
5 #### i accidentally bought this thinking it was a 10/100/1000 . OOPS , but funny thing is its been great to me . I run it for all my home audio gear and my media center . I leave the better faster for my gaming stations set up for lan parties . Once i get a media cabinet this is getting its own spot and some custom brackets .
5 #### Mud flaps look great , very durable . Would look great on a dually , never got a chance to install them . I had to trade in my f-350 , it was a rust bucket , for a new regular single wheel .
4 #### I liked it for the week we had it lol . Husband did n't tell me he was buying a 55 inch a week after we got this installed ! Worked well and great price !
5 #### This is a replacement for an Absorber I owned for several years which I lost . It works as advertised and will not scratch the paint as long as it is used correctly . Do not use it dry . Wet first and then wring it out .
5 #### I was looking for a mic to record my commentary for gameplay videos . This works great ! Despite the fact that when you plug it into your ipod touch your speakers turn off , it is amazing . This is small but as they say , Good things come in small packages . It is quite clear but this varies on how close it is to your mouth and what device you are using to record with . When I use it to record audio on my Blackberry Phone the audio has a lot more static than when I record with my iPod Touch . Over all , I would really recommend this product . If you are leaning towards getting it but you are a bit indecisive , I would say go for it . The price that it is being sold for is almost the same price as a pack of gum and this would probably last you longer than the gum haha .
5 #### what more can i ask ? an excellent price for an excellent cable . my son loves having extra cords for his ipod touch .
5 #### The only way to fill a battery without getting acid on yourself .
5 #### Compared to other picks I 've used . These feel comfortable with a good enough thickness to feel solid and enough flexibility to not feel like just a cut out .
5 #### This stuff really works .... I had dull headlights and the product really removes the yellow film that builds up on the head lights .
4 #### These were cheap and I needed some cables for my FX loop . These did the trick , and they are also good for general use . My only gripe with them is that the ends of the cable can get loose , almost as if the ends were being unscrewed . Minor complaint and it does n't really change the sound , but it got annoying over time .
4 #### It is a big , roomy case . My phone fits perfectly with some room to spare . The belt clip is not very strong so I improvised by placing a large key ring through both clip holder and the metal loop . The a placed a small carabiner hook through the key ring . It sounds like a lot but it is a very simple and effective fix .
3 #### Does not fit the 1985 Cadillac El Dorado as advertised . The next size up . ( group 5 ) is reply too large , drags on the ground and does not hold on place .
2 #### This book has pages like those in a phone book and the images are very hard to make out ( all black and white ) . You could print this all out on your home printer from a digital copy and end up with better quality . Automotive repair manuals need to be able to stand up to dirt , grease and frequent handling . I 'm not impressed with it at all . I 'd like to see a mechanic under the hood of a car fumbling around with their Kindle , give me a break !
5 #### These have excellent tone and last quite a while . I have a Martin guitar and a Larraviee guitar and I use these on both . Very happy with them .
5 #### Best network switches on the market ! NETGEAR is all I use now . I have used all other brands and there is no reason to try any others any longer . I have installed many of these in client sites and all my family members have been upgraded to these switches . No better out there !
5 #### I have a 2000 F250 Diesel with two batteries we use as a plow truck . Between this and the block heater it always starts first crank . Update 8 years later it still works perfectly . Just connect it to the matching terminals on the vehicle and plug it in .
5 #### Definitely worth buying if you have the Voyager Bluetooth . The headset fits nicely in the case and it is n't bulky .
5 #### Very fast delivery and product meets my needs . Will consider for future purchases !
5 #### When I first purchased this cable release I expected it to last a year a the most . I 've had it for 3 years now and it still functions as well as it did when I first got it . It has taken a 30 mile trip hanging out of my car ( and consequently dragging against the pavement ) and some how survived . There is room for improvement : a longer cable and a better wrapping mechanism would be greatly welcome . Overall , this cable release is well built and holds up very well . Note : if you are doing long exposures , make sure you use your camera 's mirror lockup to minimize the vibrations caused by the mirror flipping up and invest in a sturdy tripod .
5 #### Excellent quality REAL NATURAL leather and construction . I use it for my small Samsung digital camera . I do not use it for the iPhones -- most likely will not fit the iPhone 5 and up -- the case be would a bit short in height . Real natural leather is getting rarer and rarer -- I do n't know why -- we still eat a lot of meat . It 's not a con but I 'll mention it : the opening does not have any closure so things inside could fall / slip out if it 's too thin .
5 #### Very easy to install especially when you follow the steps per the official instructional video available on youtube . Looking good and works too . It 's raining today .
5 #### I bought this CB radio as part of my preparation for my first Jeep Jamboree . CB radios are the primary means of communication on Jeep Jamborees as cell phone reception is almost non - existent when you are traveling on mountain trails or in the woods . The Jamboree I participated in was held in Ouray , CO and I had excellent reception in the San Juan mountains . I also tested the radio in my home neighborhood and had a great connection with one of my other CB radios a half mile away ( I live in a city ) . Bottom line , I 've been well pleased with this purchase .
3 #### We put this on our window to improve reception in our apartment , it helped slightly but not that much . I think it had a hard time keeping the signal because the signal was still pretty weak by the window . When we moved apartments that had even worse reception , this did n't help at all . My suggestion is only get this if you have a spot where you get a strong signal and need to extend it .
4 #### The unwinding in town at four sharp wave worked quite well
4 #### The Nikon Coolpix 990 represents the point - and - shoot digital technology ALMOST mature . The shutter delay is hardly noticeable , and most images get written to the drive fairly quickly . Batteries almost last a reasonable amount of time . However , the Quicktime movie capability is a little awkward -- no sound -- and the color of the images seems to always be a problem . However , if you 're looking to buy a digital point - and - shoot today , this is the camera to buy . The independent , rotational - lens design is brilliant . You can point the thing at yourself and view your self - portrait as you take it , which by itself makes this camera a standout in my book . Add to that the top - quality optics and dazzling array of features , and this model is the one to beat . Given all that , for the time being I 'll stick to my ( film - based ) Olympus Stylus Epic for most of my shooting on - the - go . The Nikon is too big , too slow , too energy - hungry , and waaay too expensive to go everywhere the way the Olympus does .
5 #### The old add - a - vent motor went out and this fit perfectly . I would recommend not even bothering trying to get the old fan off if there is any rust on the shaft . Just buy the blade too .
4 #### After attending a local photography workshop , it was recommended to purchase a remote camera trigger . I was tempted to get the wireless trigger but decided on this as the price was better . I also did n't see the point in a wireless remote . Unless I 'm in the scene , there is no reason to be worried about cables since if I 'm using this remote , I 'm using it while my camera is on a tripod and I 'm not in the shot . This will allow you to get slightly sharper pictures by helping prevent camera shake .
5 #### For years I heard how great these are , but never wanted to spend the extra money . Finally gave them a try , and I will never use anything else . I have a cheaper acoustic and it sounded dead and lifeless with regular strings . Put these Elixirs on and now it sounds like a much more expensive guitar . They 're extremely comfortable and keep their sound twice as long as a regular string , so I feel that I 'm saving money in the end . And either way , if you can spend a little more and make your guitar sound way better , why would n't you ? They have seriously increased my enjoyment of playing . One caveat , if you completely de - tune your strings and tune them back up , it can mess with the nanoweb coating . I did this a few times and the coating started coming off the strings . So just be aware of that .
5 #### Worked within a few minutes in my fj cruiser , had a shudder between 1st and 2nd and now it 's gone !
5 #### They work really well with my iPhone :D the colors are awesome and basic ! Totally Recommend them ! They came in great shape and where not damaged upon arrival .
5 #### Ordered this for my BlackBerry Pearl Flip 8220 . Fits perfectly ! Does n't feel like it will slip off and has n't for the month I 've had it . Makes gripping the phone easier . Looks and feels good . Made of soft plastic , not rubber . UPDATE FEB,2012 : Still an excellent choice for the phone . Fit is still solid and I have removed the back cover many times to get to the battery . It slides right back on and locks into place .
4 #### Simple , and easy to use for what it does , this is starting to look a bit overpriced nowadays . On the good side , you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures , the batteries last for ages and it 's extremely easy to use , but on the other hand the resolution ( 640x480 in hi - res ) is n't good enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps . If you 're prepared to do lots of re - touching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool , and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself , but for anything more than simple web - site images and casual snaps you 'd be better off with a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smart - card memory storage .
5 #### Has to be the best strings I ve owned . Once I broke them in they keep their tone . Even bring the acoustic guitar places which changes the humidity does nt mess with the tone .
5 #### This unit has been very good . Its one flaw : it delivers approximately 80 % of rated capacity . I still do not understand the wide - spread use of overly optimistic ratings in the field of external mobile battery devices when other industries seem to rate their batteries to correct capacity . I have several radio controlled helicopters and airplanes , and I buy and build my own battery packs . All of the good quality batteries I have used have delivered their rated capacity or better . The NT70 T also has a great form factor , and is reasonably light for the stated capacity . What sets this device apart is the ability to charge three devices at once . The integrated USB and Micro USB cords are one of the best features on any mobile battery , and I do not know why it has not been implemented on many more of these devices . It is very handy to not have to carry or search for a USB charging cable . The four LED lights that display capacity are not very accurate . Most of the capacity is delivered by the halfway indication of two lights . I find that with two lights out of four left , the battery has much less than half the capacity . This is one thing I would ask manufacturers to do , and that is to design better charge remaining indicators . As it is , the New Trent NT70 T is one of the best mobile battery packs I have tested .
5 #### What can I say ? It 's a fuse holder with 10 gauge wire leads . Works as advertised .
2 #### This clip is actually pretty strong , BUT it 's to long for my taste , i thought i could hide it somehow to make it look as if my leather strap was actually atached to the guitar neck but it 's too long for that . The good point is that it is solid , it holds very strong , you can pull from it and it dosen't clip off .
5 #### When many other supposed " stop leak " products failed , this product sealed a leak that had baffled my repair guy and me for a number of hot and humid weeks . I do n't know how . I do n't care how . It just worked . A work of caution to other DIYers : Take care to read the instructions before you start using it because it is a bit more complicated than other stop leak products .
4 #### I bought this for two reasons : the comfort and the clarity . Probably the the most comfortable headset I 've owned and stable too . The clarity is very good for the most part , but the advertised wind cancellation feature is not exactly as good as they promote . It does a better job than others , but is still an issue with windows rolled down . Overall , an great product which I would buy again . No problems so far with holding a charge as another buyer had reported .
5 #### The padding cover ( the rubber - like cover ) wears out and peels off after awhile , but nothing aftermarket covers ca n't fix . But what really matters is the sound . I can almost use them as speakers . Awesome depth and sound .
5 #### I have a relative of mine that is big into bird watching . I have tried bird watching in the past , but found myself getting irritated with my perpetually shaky binoculars . No matter how hard I tried to hold the them still , I simply could n't do it . For me , the constant " shake , shake , shake " makes using binoculars frustrating , as the picture is never as clear or stable as it should be . Recently , I was shown a brand new pair of image stabilized binoculars from Canon . I do n't remember what particular version it was , but I was extremely impressed with it . The moment I pressed the IS ( image stabilization ) button , the picture became solid and crystal clear . Wow , what a joy to use ... After a few more weeks of using " regular " binoculars , I finally gave into the temptation to upgrade to a brand new pair of 10x30 Canon Image Stabilization Binoculars ! Wow , I am so glad that I did ... The picture is amazingly clear and the range is excellent . Besides this , anytime that I want to a stabilize the picture , I simply press the IS button -- and PRESTO ! ... A clear picture without those annoying shakes . It truly makes bird watching ( or any other hobby in which you need binoculars with an IS feature ) enjoyable again . I HIGH RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT !
4 #### I used it on my 99 dodge ram 2500 to put a leveling kit on . The safety pins had to be grinded down a hair to fit around the coil but works great after that . The grinding is why I gave it four stars
5 #### They last long and retain their tone better than most . Very happy w/ them .
4 #### Works exactly like it is supposed to . We used it to keep speaker wires for the surround sound out of sight as we ran it along the wall to the back of the room . It would be nice if it hinged open and closed as you have to slide something along the open side to allow wires to enter but otherwise it looks good , sticks to the floor , and keeps the wires from underfoot just as it ought to .
4 #### These mallets do not make the same noise as professional wooden mallets but at a price of less then two dollars you ca n't go wrong . It would have cost more to make these mallets on my own . They work but compared to other wooden mallets these give a more muted sound instead of a hard hitting sharp noise on my glockenspiel . Sometimes I prefer a slightly muted sound for practicing or for children to play with . These are great for practice of or children but if you are looking for a slightly nicer pair- try to find a longer pair . 8 in from top of ball to end of stick is pretty short- about the size of an unsharpened pencil . I like these because if children break them I do n't mind buying another pair .
5 #### I purchased this camera about 1 year ago- and now I do n't even know where my 35 mm camera is . This takes terrific pictures ( you see the results right away ) , and if you 're not happy with the result , just erase and take another picture ! This camera is lightweight , and easily fits in a pocket or a fanny pack . It does use a lot of battery power , so buy some rechargeable batteries with your purchase . I have an old HP color Deskjet printer , and the photos I print are good enough to put in my albums at 5x7 " size , 8x11 " pictures print kind of grainy- but I do n't use the high resolution setting on the camera . The instruction manual is easy to navigate and simple to follow , I carry it with me on vacations to review how to take panoramic photos ( these print beautifully ! ) , or how to set the red - eye reduction . One word of caution , always use the wrist - strap when handling the camera . I dropped my camera once on vacation , photos taken after that were too dark to see . I sent the camera back for service to Olympus , and they were fantastic ! I had the camera returned within 3 weeks , and I could track the progress of my repair online at the Olympus website . If I ever feel the need for a new digital camera , it will definitely be an Olympus !
4 #### Great magnification . Lightweight & folds somewhat compactly . Used it to see Radio City Spectacular sitting in the rafters . Turned my seat into an orchestra seat ! I got to see the Rockettes as 50 foot giants ! Just a couple of concerns : sometimes it enlarged too much , I had to lower them to find what I wanted to see . Also , be wary of dim lit places , or you may not see much through the lens . Certainly pleased with it . The amount of money I saved from purchasing the least expensive seat over the pricey orchestra seat more than covers the price I paid for these binoculars ! ! !
5 #### I got this for our iPhone 3GS 's . Now that we have upgraded to 4 's I need to see if they have one for those . Great cover to keep the back of your iphone from getting scratched up .
4 #### I 've had several pointing devices , including standard mouse , track ball , and pad . None comes anywhere close to being as natural and useful a performer as this one . Its simplicity of design hooks one almost immediately , and within a few minutes of use , one does n't want to go back to the mundanity of ordinary mice . Unlike trackballs and most low - end touch pads , it 's very sensitive , and so makes a servicable stepping stone for grahpic artists on the way to purchasing a more serious graphics tablet . If it has a flaw , it 's that its drivers seem too easily overwritable by other pointing devices you may have on the same system . Most people usually have only one pointing device , so this may be a non - issue for you , but I 've found it difficult to run a serial and a P / S 2 device , and still retain full functionality for both devices . This is important to my needs , so I have to take a star away . Even so , this is a fine mouse at a fantastic price . As someone who has spent a ridiculous amount of money on pointing devices , I wish I 'd started with this one first .
3 #### I got this to try to get 2 meter SSB reception on an emergency radio . No improvement so far but I have NOT tried very hard .
5 #### Does exactly what it is supposed to do . Arrived when it was supposed to arrive . Overall , a very nice experience .
5 #### best overall lamp I 've found , great price . Update : Still the best deal I 've found on great lamps .
3 #### This was a good idea , but I did n't like it too much . I felt like it distorted the screen and was awful in the sun . I 'll pass .
5 #### I ordered this cable to use with my Ainol NOVO7 Elf II . The cable was 10 ' as described and produces a flicker free , clear 1080p image . Mine has rounded edges where the connectors meet the cable .
1 #### This does not work with a 1997 F150 truck with 10 disc CD changer . I end up reinstalled original back in . Too much time wasted
3 #### good but not as good as some of the reviews says .
5 #### Good film for every day use . Never had any bad Fugifilm .
5 #### My son loves them . Erie Ball makes some great strings .
5 #### Canon once again delivers an excellent product . plenty of storage space durable and very user friendly . Thanks Canon !
5 #### It works just like my other one I just found the other day , a month after buying this one . I knew I had one somewhere ... All is well though , now I have one for working on stuff at home and one for the shop I 'm setting up in the back of my store . I use these more for doing one man brake jobs than holding up hoods . If you need to remove a caliper , hose or wheel cylinder crack the line open , push the pedal slowly to the floor , and stick this hood prop at the base of the drivers seat and use to hold the pedal down . The piston in the master cylinder is now blocking the ports , stopping the flow of brake fluid until you are done with the repair .
3 #### These worked but they were a bit bulkier than I thought . We ordered 2 and one broke half way through the trip . Did n't have any problems with the other one .
5 #### I 've had these cables for around a year now and they 're still working strong . These planetwaves are great for any musician that wants good cables at an affordable price . Get these and rock on ! !
3 #### This an ok tire gauge . It is not heavy duty type , the read out rod was flat and thin not as strong as the square rod that can be reading from all sides . I gave its a 3 stars because it 's not made for professional mechanics ; This pencil style tire gauge for basic use .
4 #### The bag 's construction is very good , with enough padding for your typical camera buff . It held my D80 , with 2 lenses , and the SB600 Flash easily . The side pockets are great for chargers and anything that wo n't fall out easily as they only close with a velcro fastener . The back pocket is great for paperwork , and the front pocket has plenty of pockets for all sorts of accessories . The one thing I was n't crazy about was the wasted space that you end up with , using the interior dividers in the provided configuration . There is space below the camera body that 's very hard to get into without removing the Velcro'd dividers . I ended up not using any of them and instead inserting a smaller bag I own that holds the camera and two lenses . Then I sandwich the flash ( in its pouch ) and a small tabletop tripod in the remaining space . Sounds crazy but it works better . Also cool if I want to grab the camera and just use the small bag for a quick shoot or for a lighter bag for a day 's travel , leaving the larger Tamrac bag at home , or in the car . This way you do n't have to move the camera and vital accessories from one bag to another . All this got me thinking . Tamrac could create a system like this , kind of like a backpack I own , the CamelBak Transformer , that allows one to remove sections depending on the hike you 're planning .
2 #### DOESNT FIT MY 4.3 INCH SCREEN . EHH CRAPPY QUSLITY AND WHAT NIT BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ? ? CMON PEOPLE . , ALASKA
1 #### Upon receiving item , I immediately activated it but to find out it can only be used on speaker phone . The internal handset audio would not work . Had to return it to the seller
2 #### I was hoping this would be like the microfiber silk cloths that came with both of my DiMedici flutes but other than being silk there is nothing similar . This cloth mostly just moves the moisture around as it it not absorbent .
5 #### We recently changed to a fiber optic internet provider and wished to hook both of our computers up to it . This tiny little box does a great job . We used Cat5e patch cables to connect the computers to the switch . The set up was simple and quick , and we 've had no problems so far .
4 #### A bit bulky but they work as expected . The clip to attach to your clothing or a pocket is high quality . I use with a Shure headphone type mic . Very convenient .
5 #### Works good for it 's intended purpose . Well built , strong , works best with the big end up . UPDATE : After 6 months of repeated use , the edge that grabs the rod to keep it extended is wearing out , and wants to slip when holding something too heavy . UPDATE : I filed a bunch of notches into the tubes to give the worn edge a slot to grab . Another trick is to flip the grabbers over . Fairly simple to do . Slide the rubber caps off , one at a time slide a tube out , flip the grabber over , slide the tube back in making sure to get the spring back into its correct place . I did the inner tube first , then put the small upper cap back on to keep it from falling apart . Screwdrivers helped reassembly . A different or newer model comes with 2 grabbers per tube .
2 #### I bought this based on the good write - ups about these but was disappointed when they arrived . They feel like cheap pressed metal and are very clanky . Recommend getting more substantial strap locks from another manufacturer if you need them .
5 #### Fast shipping and unlike many cables out there , the strength of the cabling is strong and does not split open
5 #### I got this longer one and it works great you can do just about wht you want to with it
5 #### I wind long - scale bass strings onto my unusual super - short - scale 26"-scale , six - stringed bass instrument , so I 'm betting I get more use out of this thing than about anybody . This device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much , much faster . The cutter worked great , too . Changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore . Ca n't ask for more than that .
5 #### I have been using this brand for more than 5 years . Very good quality . I use them to keep the hub caps from coming off . Specially on 2015 prius , I have noticed a lots missing hubcaps .
5 #### Excellent little device . Folds flat for easy packing when travelling . Light and robust . Holds my phone perfectly in landscape or portrait . If your ' phone is powered from the bottom , you may struggle to get enough room to fit in a power cable whilst the ' phone is on the stand . I had the problem with one device and solved it with a right - angle adaptor . Now onto my 3rd ' phone with this gizmo and I still like it .
5 #### I own the HTC HD2 and was looking for an armband that would work for this phone . This one works great . The holes at the bottom do n't line up perfectly but it stretches enough so that plugging the headphones is not a problem . I use it with the Motorola wireless bluetooth headphones that I purchased on Amazon and that combination works great . I would highly recommend this product .
4 #### Easily put it onto my guitar . Looks and feels great .
5 #### ... About a simple product that does exactly what it is advertised to do and includes one of the extras you need but typically do n't have ....
5 #### The best strings on the market ! Have a great feel and great tone . Makes me to play more .
5 #### Sounds great . It 's hard to beat for the price . I use for on film sets for professional audio monitoring . The only thing I do n't like is the leather coating starts to flake and peel off after a year or two . I wish it was made of a higher quality .
5 #### I 've played guitar for 14 years and these are the best acoustic strings you can get . They last longer , are easier on your fingers , and are all around great . Worth the couple of extra bucks .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Belkin - F3U133 - 16 - USB-2 - 0 - A - B - Cable-16 - Feet / dp / B00004Z5PY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Belkin F3U133 - 16 USB 2.0 A / B Cable ( 16 Feet)</a>&nbsp;I did buy this USB por my second printer , and it 's working very well , the shipping was so fast and I highly recommend this product , actually I am in one month trial with amazon prime , but definately I am very happy with the service and I recommend to everyone who buys a lot from this site . I 'm gon na keep it for 1 year . Thank you so much AMAZON ! ! !
4 #### I own 4 Gibsons and 3 Fenders . And this guitar . I 've played this against MIM Fender Teles and IMO , this guitar sounds better , even with just the stock pups . No , seriously . My guitar guy says the same thing . I put Ernie Ball 9s on mine and it plays really good . I do n't care where it 's made nor what it costs , it is a great guitar for the money . Very solid build and save for a few rough fret edges it came in great shape . A tele with some distortion is one of life 's great sounds IMO . Recommended . Cheers
3 #### Well ... it plays perfectly , but the once clear , white on blue lettering rubs right off . Body 's natural oils ... rub whatever paint they use . I 'm considering buying a perm marker in a bright color and drawing them on again . Yes , the gold side is embossed , so it wo n't rub off , but it 's the blue on white that a person looks to for quickly identifying notes . Long - term , it 's more about the pitches being stable / etc . , but I 'm disappointed that only after three uses , the lettering is rubbing off . Put a better finish on these things ... coat it with something non - toxic , but non - reactive with oils / acids from people 's fingers since that 's what we 'll be using when we hold the things . Other than storage at home , the soft pouch is useless .
5 #### Great replacement for the H730 . Works as advertised . Clear and comfortable .
4 #### Ca n't say how long it will last but I sure like having it around whenever I need it . I am always working on small engine stuff so it will get used up eventually .
5 #### This is a durable cord that has served my needs . 10 - feet was exactly what I needed . Hopefully I wo n't buy too many of these in my lifetime LOL
4 #### This key helps to press keys mas rapidly of the common thing
3 #### If you are an person on the go try this . it works okay to charge phone if need an little charge , and always need extra batteries
5 #### This is the holster to buy IF you want a holster that can be clipped to your waist band , pants pocket or anything else ( even a purse)- it is a very easy process to remove and reinsert your BB from the holster - the built in magnet will put your BB to sleep mode . Holster is perfect fit for the BB Curve ( 8330 ) . Clip rotates and is big enough to grab to release the holster from your belt ( hopefully , unlike other reviews posted here , the holster clip will not fall apart - so far it appears to be sturdy and is not showing any signs of breaking apart after one week of use - my wife has a red holster with zero signs of falling apart after 6 weeks of use ) . I previously tried the " Body Glove Clip - On " - this was a good case which adds a lot of protection for the BB , however , I found the clip on the Body Glove to be too small and therefor a major pain whenever I attempted to reattach my phone back to the swiveling detacheable clip ( the clip was attached to my belt)-this was why I quit using this . A good case would be a combination of the two - the Body Glove Case with the clip from the holster .
5 #### I use this on my headlight lenses about every 6 - 12 months - polishes them right up ... and , I have found other good uses for it too ( since basically it 's just a really - really mild rubbing compound ) - ie : I use it to polish up my fiberglass boat 's gelcoat , etc . ( do not use on paint - like your car 's clearcoat )
5 #### Son started playing digital piano but still practicing and needed one for him so our neighbor wo n't be bothered . It just arrived and he used it right away . And yes its for digital piano . I have a photo to compare the plugs ... the gray is for smart phones and the black is the yamaha
4 #### The binoculars were well constructed and suited my 10 year old grandson . He is very happy with the product . Good purchase !
4 #### Had a few issues with connecting kickdown linkage on a ' 69 Mustang
5 #### I 've had to buy more than a few reeds for a beginning oboe player . The price is reasonable for this reed , and so far it has lasted .
2 #### This headset is very uncomfortable , and does not get as good a battery life as the Motorola 's or Jabra 's . Spend an extra $ 20 or so and get something you 'll use more than twice . This is really disappointing as Plantronics makes really good wired headsets .
4 #### It works , but you fumble getting the weights to stay while you fumble with the arm counter weight . It gets a 4 star because it is very accurate .
5 #### We use this in our shop to attach metal heat tags to remanufactured engines and cylinder heads . It works perfectly for that purpose , much to the dismay of the customers that try to say " I never overheated it . " It 's cheap insurance that has saved us thousands in undeserved warranty claims .
4 #### I like these strings on my Seagull . They are n't too bright , but could be a bit bassier . I 'm still trying new strings looking for the right sound for me , latest I 've gotten are the coated Martins . They are also a tad thin sounding . I had some strings at one time that were more full sounding , ca n't remember what they were ! So , I 'm searching . If you like the sound of these , they are well made . It 's a matter of taste .
5 #### I 've been using the Macally mCup for several months ; what a terrific accessory ! Surprisingly well made , it comes with two rubberized " arms " with three slots on each side to hold devices of different widths . No tools necessary . The heavy - duty goose neck will not sag out of position , the head swivels to different horizontal / vertical click settings , and a quick push or pull will pop the phone in and out of the holder . I 'm especially pleased with the clever base unit . If you turn the knob on the base , it expands or shrinks to snugly fit any car cup . I 'm using a Droid Incredible with the thick Seidio battery in a Subaru Forrester . The mCup lets me conveniently use my phone as a GPS , MP3 player and , oh yeah , a phone . I would pay twice as much for this unit -- it 's a bargain .
5 #### great strings , for the cost even better , like most of the non treated strings , wear out is typical and the sound is alwasy excellent
4 #### Works good at a good price . Comfortable and light weight . Sound quality is good and it appears to be rugged enough for most applications
5 #### You do not have the blaupunkt radio . Which is the high end / premium that cam with some of these cars . It also at first glance seem to be incorrect size on one of the ends ( power side , NOT speaker side ) but line it up and push it together it will work .
4 #### I really like the Rio 600 . But somehow , mine came without any software ( no CD ) . When I called Customer Support , they said there were problems with the current version of Rioport Manager , and a new one would be posted to the S3 website soon . So far , it has n't been . BUT .... There is software that allows you to download files using Windows Media Player 7 , and this works fine . Windows Media Player also automatically converts MP3s to WMAs ( if you want it to , by setting the writing speed to 64mps ) . It can also transfer MP3s , but since the WMAS take up half the space and ( to my ears ) sound just as good , why not use wmas ? I can get about 14 songs on this way . Now , the second problem . The skips . My unit skipped on about 1/3 of the songs originally . But the website has a firmware update , which you download to your computer . When you run the program it updates the operating system of the Rio . The skipping problem seems to be gone , and now you can create playlists right in the player ! I 'm definitely happy about this .
5 #### I use this wheel to polish parts on my guns , it works wonders on stainless steel . My son had some surface rust on his rifle and it cleaned it right up . The only problem is when they are about a third worn down they start to shed a lot of fibers / dust . I have found that just a slight pressure works the best , work it slow and light . I also like the fact that you do not have to use any compound with it , it 's imbedded in the wheel so there is n't any goop flying off of it . Great product
5 #### Helps a lot with electrical such as trailer wiring and AC when you need to make sure it is wired correctly before doing final solder or hook - up
5 #### These binoculars look like a quality product . It 's nice and compact . For the size , I was surprised how far I could see through it . This product can be used in a number fun activities like hiking or shooting targets . It can also be a nice addition to a survival kit -- whether it 's for practical reasons or apocalypse survival . For the price , this is a great product . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I love these i m always ordering them i drop my iphone quite often and surprisingly my screen never cracks great protection !
1 #### there was no user guide and the phone looked like it was used . Did n't expect it to be that big and with very crappy ring tones .
5 #### No need to hunt for and try other brands of spark plugs for a car that came with NGK 's originally . You will not be sorry using these . They will last more than the 100 K service interval recommended in the owner 's manual . The price on Amazon was much better than could be found locally .
5 #### Exact fit for my Polaris Ranger . A lot cheaper than the Polaris filter it is the equivelant for . Got four so I have filters for several more oil changes .
4 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Garmin - Bicycle - Mount - for - eTrex - and - Summit-010 - 10267 - 00 / dp / B00004VX15 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Garmin Bicycle Mount for eTrex and Summit ( 010 - 10267 - 00)</a > At first , I thought it was all good . Then while on a ride I noticed the Etrex rattling in the mount . Upon close inspection , it was not tight as the original back . Plus the original back is coated with rubberized material . Which makes it a fairly water tight and snug fit . The replacement back is just plastic . NO rubberized coating , and thus no water proofing and no tight fit . Needless to say I was very disappointed in the quality of the product . I had to use ' plastic ' black tape around the opening to stop the rattle . But there is no protection from water . I do n't understand why the inside of the back was not designed to have either a gasket or rubberizing to protect it from water . But that being said . It is still the only option for mounting it to the handle bar of a bike . And that job , is well done . Good heavy duty mounting , with lots of extra rubber spacers .
5 #### Its very good product . I recommend . Product by excellent quality and exceptional durability . No fail and no problem . No more comment . Thanks .
5 #### I very well pleased with item and it works very well . I have told many of my friends about it .
5 #### I ve had mine for 4 years . Nice extreme wah sound , and the contour switch adds custom sound . 2 wahs in one . Nice feature . The auto off and auto on is nice , but it might drive some people crazy . If you do n't like the auto off feature , get a Crybaby wah . There is a slight delay when you step off this wah , but its adjustable if you dislike it . Open the wah , and adjust the delay switch inside . the instruction book shows you how to do it . You can remove the step off delay through adjustment . Nice product .
3 #### Works but its maybe worth $ 1 , its made of cheap plastic and made to look like chrome
5 #### Did not believe it till I tried them but they really do keep thier tone longer . I went with the phosphor bronze and have n't heard pinkfloyds " wish you were here " sound this good on my guitar ever . Will be a repeat coustomer for life .
5 #### Have always used Elixirs for acoustic for the past decade . They last for months and bring out a great sound .
5 #### I used two of these bulbs on my 03 GSXR 600 . The bulbs fit perfectly into the socket and have a little better light output than the ones that were in there . The price was also $ 3.00 cheaper than buying it from the local auto parts store . Yes these say made in Poland but they are authentic Hella . Hella has been established in Poland since 1993 as Hella Polska Sp . z o.o hence the reason for the made in Poland stamp . This is the cheapest H4 bulb on amazon the you can still get prime shipping on . All the other bulbs have been converted to add on items .
5 #### So smooth even rolling over big bumps / cracks . Super comfortable and really easy to move even with 240lbs resting on it . I found no need for a head pillow like others mention . Seems that would get in the way and limit where you can look . Easy assemble and really excellent hardware . The body feels like it would survive more punishment than its rider .
4 #### Heavy wire , great for high amperage installations , 12 or 24 volts
5 #### I have been through MANY MANY pair of Ernie Ball strings and this set is no exception . they 're always made right , very easy to install and last quite a while . These are the ONLY strings i ever buy anymore .
5 #### Very nice and durable . Just as advertised . Pleased with my purchase and buy from again . Fits the phone great ! ! Like a glove .
4 #### works as described , but my CD player still skips . But I think it 's just because the stereo in my car is older
3 #### I 've tried other wallet cases and none can hold a note to this one . Other cases are made mostly of a vinyl while this is a faux leather . I found its durability is far greater . The button snap is a huge advantage vs a magnetic flap .
5 #### No problems . They arrived on time and performed as expected .
5 #### Good quality , maintains the slim profile of the iPhone while still offering some protection . Could never understand the people who put those Otter Box cases on a an iPhone and triple the girth . Very easy to take on and off as well .
4 #### I ordered these to use with an electronic drum set and listen to drums overlaid with music . They are perfectly adequate for this and while not quite at the same clarity as my px100s , I 'm satisfied . They are worth 4 times the price imho .
3 #### This did not fit into the plug well in the head of a 3800 series 3 pontiac . I did get it to fit by modifying a spark plug extension ( used when plugs foul easily ) . Basically the dual use threads , larger set , hit the walls of the narrow plug well . Cutting a spark plug extension down to size and screwing this part into it allows this tool to be used .
1 #### I go through a lot of head sets and I am going through this one is going to be no different - as in I am going to send it back ! This thing is so big you might as well try to tape your phone to your ear . And behind your ear at that ! It is so big it feels ( too me ) as if someone is tugging on your ear ! It is not uncomfortable but actually painful ! Sound quality ? Maybe I have a bad one ? Static filled , not loud enough and not clear . Sometimes when the phone is in my pocket it does not work clearly . That is only 3 feet away ! Now the real downside .... I do not have a good recommendation for you but , I just ordered 5 different brands / types that I have not tried before . Someone has to make a good bluetooth headset . I will endeavor to find one .
5 #### I raise miniature horses and bought this Otterbox Defender Case for my new Blackberry Curve 8530 . The belt case with the clip I put on my car visor . I am often outdoors in all kinds of weather and needed something to protect my phone . I love that this has both a screen and a keyboard cover . This is perfect with all the dust , hair , and water that is constantly around . I would recommend this cover for people that live very active outdoor lives .
5 #### My go - to Capo . My original Kyser has lasted me 10 years . The only reason that I 'm purchasing another is so that my new guitar can have its own Capo in its case .
5 #### These rods are great to use in place of the traditional wooden drum sticks when you need to play a little quieter and not overpower the rest of the band . My only complaint is that they tend to break down and splinter too quickly .
5 #### Ordered 2 of these and both work very well . 100 % pleased 1 week into using the product . Unit connects seamlessly with each phone it was intended for . Would buy again .
1 #### OMG Bad sounding , they sound dead , got a fake set from china , yes there out there ! or maybe Elixirs sound this way going back to the greatest Sounding strings D'Addario
5 #### I 'm really pleased with this cover . It was inexpensive and fit my phone perfectly and looks nice . I 'd definitely buy this product again , and recommend it .
3 #### I 've been a fan of Mighty Bright book lights for years , but this one is not really a book light . It seems to have been designed to light music on music stands , for which it is probably excellent . As a book light , it 's pretty bottom heavy and does n't clip comfortably to your book . However the light is quite bright and falls evenly and broadly on its subject .
1 #### Shame on Hella , I have used their products for over 30 years , this set of lights are JUNK . Removed the back plate to install upgraded bulbs ( brand new out of the original box ) and the O ring seals were not in - place(floating around in the housing ) . Re - Installed the O ring seal , mounted the lights , after the first use in a rain storm the Front Lens seals let water into the lights . Think Hella needs to move their factory back to Germany or get the QC folks out of the Chinese break room .
5 #### this strap is simple and comfy . I literary have like 5 of these . they 're the only strap i can get along with .
3 #### The battery worked fine . It was delivered as promised . I 'm not getting excited . I expected it to work good . It 's only a battery .
5 #### Nice , bright sounding light gauge strings with an unwrapped G for easy bending . I use these exclusively on all of my acoustic guitars .
3 #### So far , it works . I am still waiting to see how long a life it has . The vendor though could be a little more transparent . I smelled fish when I saw the ridiculously low pricing . Then I realized at check out that they were going to take it through the backdoor with equally ridiculously high shipping and handling fees . I ended up buying one quarter the quantity I wanted ........... Well , it still came out cheaper than other places .
5 #### I ca n't not have these on my Fenders . They 're so much nicer and more comfortable than the crappy bent metal ' vintage ' style saddles that are on Fenders now .
5 #### What ca you say about batteries ? These work as expected . I bought them to replace the dead batteries in a couple of watches and they work fine . I recommend the batteries and the vendor .
2 #### Purchased the binoculars for a Grand Canyon trip . I followed the manufacturer instructions for setting up binoculars but just does n't work . The picture it 's blurry , looks like the focus can not be adjusted . Next time i will know how to buy a better pair ..... don't get cheap when u wanna purchase optics .
5 #### Used on my 1995 c1500 and it fixed my dead wipers that only would work when they want to .
3 #### Nokia 5800 is my first touch phone . The phone and features are ok ( not too good or too bad ) As I never used the touch phone before , I find it very difficult ( more distracting ) to even dial speed dial numbers when driving . The GPS works perfect even without a data plan . The only catch is the manual says to go online when connecting GPS , but do not do that . It seems that it will access data over the wireless network . The phone I got started to give very less talktime < 2hrs as opposed the spec says > 8hrs . The features are great if compared with other touch phones . The touch screen does not seem to be responsive ( may be I should not compare with iphone :-) )
5 #### When I ordered this and it was so cheap in price I did not expect too much , but just needed something to add a few electric gadgets I occasionally use when doing crafts . WOW , this thing was heavy duty even the wire , has a plug - in that goes flat to the plug so you can put behind furniture etc . Wish I had gotten more for that price . Oh has labels for VCR , TV , Stereo , etc , color coded .
5 #### First used these in 1970 . Best strings around for a deep bass sound . No buzzing and easy on fingers . Thank You . Thanks you .
5 #### An outer ply of 5mil film and an inner ply of 7.5mil film , in combination with a 2mil overtone control ring on the underside that " floats " with the head , eliminating excessive overtones and controlling sustain . Precision - drilled dry vents around the perimeter of head reduce overtones and control sustain .
3 #### this case was a lot more flimsy than what I thought it would be I had the small page right above the volume buttons break shortly after installing it on my phone .
5 #### Beautiful case and easy to remove . One of my favorite cases that I have bought from Amazon . Recommend it highly .
5 #### I 've tried other brands over the years ... but always come back to the Rico Royal 's . They just work better for me .
5 #### Just what I expected . I have had this item for over a year now and it has never given me a problem . Works every time .
5 #### Best their is and sounds great . Good Quality and it 's Fender ... all you need .
5 #### This is not only an eye catching case but also very durable and practical . Only criticism : it is easy to get the ' watermark ' or dust under the screen protector but that is a small price to pay for the protection . I also do miss access to the mute button but can work around it using settings .
5 #### Bought this wiring harness for a 2001 Ford F150 XLT extended cab pickup . I was really concerned about putting so many wires together . The package tells you which wire does what , so they were easy to match with my wiring harness that came with my radio / CD / DVD unit . I bought some heat shrink tubing and tied one wire at a time and soldered the connection . I then applied heat to the heat shrink . It was very easy doing it in this order and did n't leave me with a big wad I would have if I had used crimp on connectors . I plugged in my unit to the radio harness and then the Metra harness to my pickup . Turned my ignition on and everything worked great ! This made a hard job an easy job . I highly recommend it !
5 #### Used this on my buddy 's 2000 Honda Civic Si 's headlights that were foggy . Worked the product into the headlight and removed it before it dried . I did this four times to each headlight . I then polished each light twice and waxed each twice . The headlight looks brand new . He is pretty happy now that he no longer has to purchase new headlights . For the price when compared to a headlight " kit " that costs $ 15 - 25 , this is a no brainer .
5 #### A little tight , but fits the iPod 3 g touch perfectly
2 #### I used this on my car the other day for the first time with excitement . I ended the clean with less enthusasism :( I bought two with the hopes of using one in the house and one on the car . Will try two for the car on wash number two . Maybe that will make the job easier . Also takes a few swipes to pick up the water . Need at least a second try . I detailed the clean with a nice towel " Meguiar 's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3 " I bought two of these and should have just bought four sets in hindsight . They work as advertised and am impressed with the results . Easy to use and no streaks . These special type of absorbents all give me difficulty and have yet to find the trick or the magic chamois or absorber . This was definately not it !
5 #### The product was great for the money I would recommend and purchase again
5 #### This is a very sturdy case . I 've dropped it on pavement and it protected my phone from any damage . The belt clip is a must too . Holds the phone tight even recently while attached to my camelback when I whipped out on my mountain bike . I highly recommend the case . There is a knockoff for cheaper than the otterbox but the screen protector is poor quality . Go with otterbox .
2 #### Way too small . Not a good value . Buy a small pillow and some Velcro instead .
4 #### I ordered this to lighten the look of my 4S and it does the trick . I would recommend it to others .
5 #### I use this stuff for more than just cleaning Carbs as it leave very little residue . Love this stuff .
2 #### Takes FOREVER to cure , it 's been on for about a week now and is still tacky . It may be resistant to gasoline when it 's dried but I think that will be in the spring when it warms up .
5 #### I just got these headphones and they 're wonderful . Very light and easy to wear and the sound quality is fantastic . I like my classical music played loud . These headphones let it rock my soul . They 're super . I recommend them to anyone . Well worth the price .
5 #### I now own three pair of these , They are a bargain , as I have dozens of earbuds ( mostly in ear ) and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound . The only pair I ever " broke " was a pair that I sent through the wash TWICE ! You will spend at least 2 - 3 times their price to beat them . One audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better ( at $ 299.00 ) Again , best value given their price and performance .
3 #### I was so excited to find a USB rechargeable book light . I thought that , because of the brand , it would be a quality book light . After one week of gentle use , it stopped charging . Now I have a $ 20 book light that wo n't even turn on . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Updated : I opened it up and found that a connection within the light was not making contact . After bending this back into place , it has worked like a dream . I 'm still disappointed that it was n't made well , but it 's very nice to have a rechargeable book light .
5 #### Four ounce spray can puts lubricant where you want it . Very small so you can take almost anywhere . This is probably the best lubricant for guns and knives . I have tried so many . My second choice is Break Free CLP but it is more of a penetrant and deposit remover . Never had any negative issues in thirty years of use . I have around five of these little cans floating around the house and garage .
5 #### Firm but not super - rigid ..... works like a dream on my 2004 Silverado 2500 HD 4x4 with extended cab . Did n't even have to drill anything !
4 #### First binoculars ever bought , I would opt to get something higher although I 'm happy for now with it
4 #### ca n't beat the price , not my personal favorite string , but could n't pass up such a great deal .
5 #### Been using these for longer than a decade , and met many people who prefer minimal picks , and jazz III among them . This is the closest to playing with bare hand that I can get .
5 #### There are tricks to making the application easy . The single most effective thing is water . The cleaner/ protector mad the sealer can dry to a hard to remove substance . Dampen one of your clothes and use to remove , then quickly follow up with the dry cloth . Simple . With the sealer , same thing . This stuff works very well and I get a solid three to six months protection if desired . I love the shine , so I clean the cars bimonthly
5 #### Worked great came on time ! 07 jeep Wrangler fit right on
5 #### Worked very well to grease the wheel bearings on a trailer . Very easy to use and holds a lot of grease .
4 #### I have n't actually used these strings . I actually bought them to use ' down the road . ' Currently , I have a small supply of strings , but I wanted to add to my backstock . I have used this brand of strings before and I find these are very good bargain . I think I should have bought more .
5 #### suction mount Exelente i buy this 5yr ago and no problem only work with you 3 g , 3gsiphone or in my case ipod 2nd generation this feet good . this not extended the size is one size design . but is Exelente cuality products
5 #### Very heavy cable way better then you need picture is great
3 #### Very good quality case that is well - worth the price . One minor problem with it is that the clear plastic window that one is supposed to view the GPS screen through produces a lot of glare and scratches easily , making it hard to see through .
4 #### Looks good , feels good , and makes my mums white iPhone look stellar . This was the exact case she was looking for and it fits snugly and feels good in her hand . Excellent case for the money .
5 #### Works as described , comes in handy for changing my 12 string !
5 #### I use this product in my ford focus after changing my oil and runs get , better gas millege and runs quiet
5 #### Works flawlessly . I like the fact that my Galaxy supports carrying an extra battery ( bad apple , bad ) and that I never have to worry about running out of juice . Just pop out the dead battery and pop this one in :)
5 #### I 've used them for years , and when they break I 'll buy another .
5 #### Works well would buy again if needed . Just be sure not to over ratchet it when using it
5 #### This is a great product . My only possible complaint is that it just seems a little bit cheap on the fit and finish . Keep in mind that it does exactly what it 's supposed to and allows you to use regular headphones with your samsung phone . It is pretty durable and I 've had mine for several months now . I 'm going to buy another one just because I tend to leave things at work or at home so that I have one everywhere I go . Oh , and let me take this opportunity to say " Hey Samsung ! Put a headphone jack in your phones ! "
5 #### Looks resistant and fits perfectly in my Yamaha NTX700 . Happy with this new acquisition .
5 #### The only sticks I use . I do n't even use smaller sticks for back ups !
5 #### it comes with two pieces : for the external and internal . it fits well , and it feels thick and slick enough where light stratches wo n't penetrate it . good buy for me
5 #### This sealant works extremely well , under or not under water , does the best job of any sealant I have ever used !
4 #### This is an interesting idea . A Chinese policeman comes to the UK to look for his daughter who is in trouble . He speaks no English and has immense difficulties finding his way around and finding any information . He does not approach the police in the UK , preferring to use rather rough tactics to find his way . He has a bit more luck than could be considered probable , in both finding the people he is looking for , finding someone to translate for him , and keeping out of jail himself . He commits a few murders along the way , which do tend to not be ignored in the UK . There are some interesting human trafficking scenarios . Hopefully it is not happening but there must be some aspects of reality there . Not a novel for the teens but an interesting read with some insights into cultural assumptions and differences .
4 #### I used it for a major ding , we 'll see how it holds , if it does then 5 star rating .
5 #### Was really good I helped several people with it , until I decide to remove a tree trunk and us works perfectly , but tangled really bad on the trunk , I ca n't take it out without destroy it , now is gone , but I pull heavy trucks , suv 's , and one sport car , never had a single problem
5 #### Does the job I got it for at a stellar price . No complaints . Buying from Amazon saved me money . I would have paid a lot more had I gone to Radio Shack or Best Buy .
5 #### This is my second pair and for the price , the sound is great as is the portability .
5 #### Really like this , a relatively cheap way to pack bearings quickly and effectively , seems very durable , recommended .
3 #### Tool was awesome ! Definitely helped with the engine work I needed done . Only thing was , the tool looled like it had a gouge in it , like it was dropped before packaging . My part also would nt fit on my breaker . I had to use a hammer to pound it on all the way which was annoying ! Had to do the samething to get the thing off . Feel like the paint made it slip and could have been done better .
5 #### I swear by this thing . I can sit back and read my email and peruse the internet without having to have my hand / wrist in an awkward position . You can set it just about anywhere you want . No more sliding my hand back and forth with a mouse . I barely have to move my thumb and fingers to get this baby sliding my cursor around . The added Mouseware software is highly customizable and easy to use . If you 're a gamer you may not like using a trackball but , for everyone else this is a must . No wires to get tangled and best of all no sliding your wrist all over . The battery life is pretty darn good . They 'll last for months literally . All in all a great purchase .
5 #### I have had this product for several weeks now . I am usually pretty tough on holsters and have broken most of mine on the rotating clip due to my seat belt on my car . This one however seems to be a lot tougher that my previous holsters . I have had no issues with it in any way . I am pleased with this one and would recommend it to my friends .
5 #### Perfect . We keep them in the car and pull them out on a road trip , and do n't have to worry about forgetting them when we go to theatre . Highly recommend
5 #### I mean , what can I say when you read the back of the pack and see from the Eagles to Pennywise , to almost everyone under the sun uses Ernie Ball man ! I like to put these bad boys on my acoustics as well , it gives them a jangly vibe I ca n't explain but love nonetheless . Quit mess ng around an out these in your axe and get back to playing already ! pack is sealed shut with 3 individual sets vacumm sealed inside that so when you use one set , the other 2 will still be as fresh as the day they were made !
5 #### I have been a fan of very few drumhead brands and styles . The Evans G2 make my drums sing . The tone is perfect and the mid - range attack that they produce has allowed me to use them with the multiple bands that I play in . I need versatility as I am playing in 5 bands with music variety from big band to rock , pop , and country . Highly recommended all around !
5 #### This saves so much time for getting strap on and off . Great design . I love it . Worth the money and is built well .
4 #### I 've been using my Jabra headset for a couple of weeks and have been very pleased with it . I bought it primarily for use while driving . It 's very comfortable to wear . It has performed extremely well in the car . At times , I 've used it at home . The range of the headset is quite good , but I get more static in my apartment . From time to time , I lose connection with my phone . I suspect that it 's more a problem with my phone than with the headset ... I only wish that the phone would come with a charger for the car as this is where I ( and perhaps most people ) will use the headset . In any case , I can highly recommend the Jabra headset .
3 #### My phone the LG G3 does not fit where the phone should fit . The tablet area is a nice size . I want to return it . Though I have to pay 6$. So I might as well just take the loss . Which is a lesson learned .
5 #### Fits my 02 Wrangler perfect and like the fact that it 's stiff enough where it does n't crumple like some other brands do .
5 #### It work as described no problems . Keep in mind it is 2.0 so expect 2.0 results . Good price .
3 #### Bought this phone to use as a business phone - just for calls and messages . It lasted about 6 months .
5 #### I use these and some other percussion sticks when we get together with the grandkids . they love being able to be part of the music . the sound is quite good and if you can move an shake your hand , you can make music with them . they should last forever . they are durable .
5 #### For whatever it 's worth , this was a deal I could n't pass up . Graduating to a new Smart Phone from a 2003 dinosaur , blue tooth was a new and exciting option for my phone . When I saw the price of this blue tooth headset , I had to buy it regardless of even one negative review . My daily Starbucks order is more than this ! After receiving the Motorola H270 , I connected the device effortlessly to my Smart Phone and began calling people to check it out . Many of my callers could not detect that I was talking on a blue tooth device ... and I even moved the phone around to test the connection . Overall , it 's quality is excellent and I ended up purchasing a couple more for Christmas gifts ! Like I mentioned , it was like buying a round of coffees at Starbucks ... all three purchases ! Great value ! Great buy !
5 #### The DrumDial Tuner is simply amazing . Easy to use , beautifully made and makes tuning my drum heads easier than ever . It 's fairly weighty ( lots of metal and I think it 's glass ) has adjustable memory markers to keep track of your set numbers , can be adjusted back to zero , it 's easy to read and very sensitive . Comes with a spacer but it 's really not necessary , you just place the Drum Dial a half inch from the tension rods / tuning lugs and turn your drum key until you get to your desired tension number ( perhaps a bit under your desired number as everything goes up with each successive lug being tightened . ) It works on batter and resonant / snare side heads for snares , toms and bass drums . Amazing tool . Saves so much time .
5 #### Purchased my first one in the late 90 's still using it today .
3 #### I bought these during a special Amazon sale at half price . They arrived quickly and in perfect condition . I use these at night when I watch TV or movies in bed . Last night was my first try with them . I am very pleased with the quality of these headphones , but like a few others have noted in their reviews , after about an hour I found them uncomfortable . I replaced another pair of Sony headphones that I 've had for over 5 years and those were never uncomfortable .
3 #### I could n't tell any difference , I just added it to boost my ATF since I could n't afford a full synthetic this service .
5 #### The bag is perfect . Just as described . It will hold the camera and two lens . And few battery 's just as described .
5 #### I have a 3rd generation ( 2007 - 2014 ) Expedition , and there are 2 cigarette lighters in the dash - one below the A / C controls , and another PowerPort on the side . I decided to replace the cigarette lighter , and this was a direct fit in the existing hole . I pulled the fuse , pulled the dash trim(check YouTube for a video ) , snipped off the factory cigarette lighter harness , connected black to negative and green to positive ( with crimping sleeves from AutoZone ) and it was done , works great with an iPhone . The green LED is bright when looking right at it , but off - angle , it 's barely noticable . I left the square bracket off , obviously , and it looks very factory and neat - much better than a cheap USB adapter stuck in the cigarette lighter , which I did n't have a lot of luck with .
4 #### These strings have a great sound . They are good enough for an amateur to use on stage . Beginners as well as the intermediate violin musician should like these strings for the sound and the playability of these strings . These strings also hold the tuning very well .
1 #### This is a total waste of your money .... put it in , vcr cuts off . Over and over . Pay a little more and get a better one .
5 #### I intend to use these for my future truck but for now i use them on my jeep that 's maybe 3 tons ...
4 #### Ca n't beat the price but the weight is way too light to use comfortably without dropping it . It is a good value though .
5 #### ... as promised . New seller came thru as promised . I have an iPhone that I gave up a well loved RAZR for . Now the RAZR is my backup / motorcycle riding phone . Thank you .
5 #### These cables are just what I hoped they would be . They work well on my electric and my acoustic . Happy guy here Thanks
5 #### great price for tool when you have to grease wheel bearings on cars or trailers
4 #### I purchased this trunk organizer as a Christmas gift for a friend to use in his 2004 Ford f150 . My friend seems to really like his organizer and is happy with it as a substitute for a similar unit that I use in my 2010 Ford F150 . I personally like my unknown brand organizer because mine has two dividers that separate the cargo organizer into three bins for storage . Both units fold easily to be put away behind or under the rear seat in an extended cab pickup . My friend likes that his organizer has a zippered cover while my unit does not have that feature .
5 #### Very nice screen protector . Easy to install . Comes with everything you need to install it right the first time . Would buy this product again .
5 #### Did n't realize how badly I needed these until I installed them
5 #### i love this addon for my EDC pack .. it fits perfect and works great ! ! Keeps my emergency phone held in place perfectly !
5 #### I was initially skeptical about any product claiming to produce a cleaner , clearer headlight lens with almost no work . I have tried other similar products and found them to be a waste of time and money . But my wife has been complaining about her headlights for a year so I thought I would take a chance with Meguiars and found , to my surprise , that this product actually works . Before I used Meguiars , her high beams would shine little more than her low beams . After Meguiars , the high beams were bright , and her low beams were back to original specs . All this on a 10year old car that had the original lens . Great Product .
5 #### I like that it retracts and stays right at the length that you want it to . I would suggest it to others .
5 #### Fits good , don't know how long they will last in the sun all the time
5 #### I use these on my Martin Backpacker , because it requires extra light string and I ca n't seem to keep from breaking strings . I do n't to go broke using premium coated strings if they 're just going to break , so I stick with these guys . They sound nice enough until one or two break , then it 's time for a new set anyway . For a daily " workhorse " type of string , for a guy who just sits around on the porch strumming and picking little ditties , these are great strings . If you 're doing gigs and playing live ? maybe you want to upgrade , I do n't know . I happen to think that how you play the guitar matters a good deal more than what strings are on it .
5 #### Perfect addition to the motorhome cockpit and it matches ! ! !
5 #### Pros : Great sound Clear , crisp , and bass is perfect not over saturated to the point where you ca nt hear the music . Cheap for its quality Build is solid and not very plasticy like others Not tight on the head nor does it fall off from being too loose Cons : I have encountered none
5 #### I purchased this on a recent road trip when I left my mobile phone 's OEM AC charger behind . While there is not much obvious difference ( other than price ) between replacement AC chargers , the iGo AC adapter / charger for mobile electronics , the iGO has unique flexibility that make it worth considering over others : -First are the interchangeable charging tips . Buy a single charger , and it accommodates a variety of swappable charger form factors ( I also purchased charging tips or an iPod Nano and a Bluetooth headset ) . -<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Add - an - iGo - Power - Splitter / dp / B002BKW1U4 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Add an iGo Power Splitter</a > Splitter , and you get the flexibility of being able to charge two devices at the same time .
1 #### The LG enV touch is an awful phone . The accessories work but it 's just such an awful phone , everything that goes with it deserves a one star rating .
5 #### As you well know Panasonic is still wanted in Reading making up the best headphones at a minimal price out there and these do them Justice . Sound quality good . You can still get a good set of headphones without paying $ 200
4 #### I bought them for a concert I was attending , they worked pretty good , I was impressed that I could still see pretty clear at the distance I was . Now I use them for birdwatch at my backyard and I like them a lot . I can see very clearly at the birds . I recommend them 100 % .
4 #### This was a great opportunity to save money . Luckily I know and IT person who helped me install it . I 'm not saying that a person could n't install it if he had to .. it just helps to know somebody who has done it before . Not the greatest instructions and you need a tiny screw driver which was not included . Anyways , I would definately recommend this to anybody needing to replace a screen on an Ipod . My daughter 's screen had a crack in it and only showed half the screen .
2 #### I found this product very clumsy , I 'm sorry but did n't help me !
2 #### I did not factor in my stars cause I miss my auto hubs though . One star cause they work , and one cause they are easy to install . Take one off cause Warn wants me to deal with my issues . two cause my issue makes me need a tool to lock one of them in and its all scratched up now . And third star off cause they are both hard to turn ! I might have had better luck if I paid less . Watch out , they have some bad ones floating around and selling them online is a great way for a slimeball to wash his / her hands . But hey , they work . I just feel like I was had . Everyone should get what they paid for . I paid extra and got less . BS !
5 #### Fits both my camera and my 72 mm filters , so does everything I want it to , and it 's * super thin * which makes it ideal for my needs .
3 #### Good strings , but a little to bright for my liking .
4 #### This item was a little bulky for long term use , but was great for day travel when I did n't ha e a charging cord . Took my iPhone 4 from 20 % charge to 80 % charge in about an hour . Great for the price ....
5 #### I 've used this one time and it did an excellent job . Really does pull water and for auto cleaning leaves a spot free finish .
2 #### The case I purchased from here was so thin and just kept cracking all around the edges . It was a pretty design but i feel like it was n't made correctly since it just fell apart .
5 #### Perfect for my 48re Ram 3500 trans pan . No leaking and easy to install . Just do n't over torque the nut or you 'll warp the silicon washer .
5 #### Great capo ! does what its suppose to and it looks nice !
5 #### Works fine for 1/3 the cost of the Factory Tool . Unless your a Pro Honda Tech and want to prop up you ego , go for this China copy . It 's gon na spend 99 % of its life in your box hiding anyway . Trust me .
5 #### This is a great tool . I work on so many cars that the hood supports have gone bad and wo n't support the hood . Out comes the Lisle Hood Prop and all is good . Another use for this tool is when the factory hood prop is in your way of getting into the engine compartment you can let down the factory prop rod and use the Lisle Hood Prop off to one side out of your way . Ever need to check the brake lights on a vehicle ? The Lisle Hood prop works great . Just put one end down on the brake pedal and extend the other end to the steering wheel and there you have it a prop rod as a brake pedal depressor . Now you do n't have to grab someone to eyeball the brake lights for you anymore . Need the hood to open further than the stock hood prop ? Use the Lisle Hood Prop and extend it to its full length and you now have more underhood access . It 's a tool I use everyday and worth every penny
4 #### Great product . I have problems with my elbows being bent to hold a phone up for more than a few minutes so I started using a headset quite a few years ago . The only complaint I have about this headset is there is no volume control on the headset itself but other than that its a great headset .
4 #### Harder than described to install . Runs a little small . I did get it on and I do like it . Hope it last a long time ! ! !
4 #### I have been using the HS850 for the better part of 2008 and have found it to be a competent little unit . It pairs quite nicely with my Motorola i880 that was assigned by my employer . I find the volume level to be good , though not outstanding . I can hear the other party quite clearly and have had no complaints going in the other direction . The HS850 that I got from Amazon came with a charger and minimal instructions , but I had no issues . After being plugged in for one overnight cycle it was ready to go . The fact that the mike boom also acts as an on / off switch is great , as it tends to conserve battery life . Are there better units on the market ? Most likely . But I feel that I 've gotten some decent value out of this handy headset from Motorola .
5 #### I am 72 and wanted JUST a good phone but felt I was not ready for a " senior " phone and definitely did not want a smart phone . My son had had one of these when they first came out and loved it so when I saw this one I jumped at it . It is a super phone ... great reception , well made , takes photos ( not great but good enough for wallpaper ) , and does not have all the junk that I did NOT want . I am thrilled with it ... if what you want is just a great phone then go for it ! It also has darn good battery life . Before I put my sim card in it I had transferred all my contacts to the sim card and presto when the sim card went in all my contacts where there . By the way the phone sent to me was definitely new and not refurbished . Thanks Amazon and Motorola .
5 #### This is your basic , black electric guitar cable but it works great . So far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great ! Nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough . If problems arise later with this cable , I will update this review , but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable .
5 #### Single piece adapter with replaceable " O"ring . Minimizes the chance of leaks , unlike some of the other units on the market . I also use this for the R-134 refrigeration tanks that have the 1/4 " male flare fitting . These tanks are the ones that I get from the refrigeration supply house that used in the household / commercial appliance industry . This allows me to use either tank , whether they are from the refrigeration supply house or the auto parts store . This way I can shop by price and stock up without worry of the tank not being compatible with my refrigeration manifold gauge set !
5 #### I immediately fell in love with this mouse the first time I used it . The contours fit perfectly into your hand , whether being left or right - handed . There are 4 programmable buttons , as well as the fifth button in the scroll wheel . The scroll wheel can be programmed as well . This mouse can be used with a USB or serial / ps2 connection . The convenience , which should I choose ? USB of course , but for those of you who do n't have a USB equipped computer , do n't fret . The optical mouse are superb these days , since they do not require a good surface to be used on . Wheel mice are horrible now , how can I go back to a mouse with a dinky wheel ? ! I have a desk with a crack in the center , which a wheeled mouse would studder as I roll it over the crack . Not with this optical mouse , it does n't even flinch when I roll it over the crack ! I highly recommend this mouse to anyone who is skeptical about an optical mouse .
5 #### It 's all there . At least as good quality as the original . I 'm happy .
5 #### works like every other power strip i have got from them only one has had a problem that is one of the green product versions . its great , cheap and has good spacing for the plugs
4 #### Subject says it : Installed easily , quickly , and looks great on 2003 f150 . During the install , I realized I had to " shove " the plastic screws into the hood ( they were n't moving when I tried to screw them in ) . This seemed to work on my vehicle without damaging the installation hardware which was plastic .
4 #### hope it holds up and other reviews look good , why even buy a high end one when they sound like this .
4 #### If you are having a problem with your OBD 1 or OBD 2 car you should buy this . It will read your trouble codes and give you more info on sensors , fluid temperture and other engine data for your car . You can reset your Trouble codes . Its is easy to use but wish there was a way to print the info out or to store the data in the scanner .
5 #### This is a pretty good value at four bucks ; slightly cheaper than the hardware store and far more convenient if you can wait a few days . Shipping was quick . This is a pretty versatile size - you can always connect two together to make a longer one , as I did recently to rig some pulleys to my ladder to create an overengineered turkey frying apparatus . They 're rated to 75lbs , which makes them plenty strong for strapping furniture to the wall ( just need some brackets or eye screws mounted into a stud ) , and it 's far cheaper than the baby proofing products intended to do the same thing . One tip : they can be tough to fasten in tight spaces ( like behind a cabinet ) , but using a pair of needle nose pliers in each hand makes it easy to feed one end into the other and tighten it right down .
5 #### Do your research people , this thing is the best for drying your car . It helps so much when washing your own car . Do n't use rags that will drag dirt & hold onto rocks to scratch your paint . I ca n't go with out this thing and I truly stand by it . Highly recommend Very easy to use and saves you time Fast and easy shipping Love it
5 #### Holds my acoustic 6 string great . Up and out of the reach of a baby just learning to walk , wife also things it looks attractive on the wall as an art piece . Quality product at a good price .
5 #### after breaking my phone screen twice in 2 weeks it was time to properly protect it . this works like a charm . as well when i got it it was only $ 20
4 #### Easy to install and the TV is still on the wall after three weeks ! I consider this a good value for the money
5 #### Well , it 's genuine PIAA so you know the quality and authenticity of what you 're buying ... The service was quick ; absolutely no problems . I would buy these again .
5 #### Great high quality grease gun . No problems with leakage so far but have only used a few times . Will see how it holds up compared to my old gun . Like the one piece cap and handle .
5 #### Works well for what these are . There 's of course some distortion but not bad . My daughter has used this for a couple of months with no problem . I thought the thin cord may break easily but it has n't .
5 #### Great item . Very well made . Packaged securely . Happy . Will buy again .
5 #### Changed the sound of my Epiphone profoundly . Much easier to hold chords too .
4 #### Keeping it on stock , my regulator was in need of parts not supplied in kit
4 #### very useful everytime you change your oil but I wish the opening is bigger
5 #### Just what I needed for my tv sound system ! Great price and fast shipping !
4 #### No big deal ... It 's advertised as a heavy duty clamp , but I received a box that says " Medium - Duty " . The clamp moves around a little when turning the know . It fits my mobile DJ needs . Good product .
5 #### purchased as an extension cable so I could tether my dslr to my laptop . build quality is great , works flawlessly . not too much to say except does what it needs to , and i see it as a quality buy .
5 #### I purchased one of these to split out the CAT5 cabling in my basement ; I only had one cable coming in but needed three . So far it has been working 24/7 for the past 6 months with no problems . This switch is super simple . There are no web interfaces and complicated configuration steps to go through . Do n't need them . Just plug it in , plug in your CAT5 cables and go . The hardest part of the installation was installing the screws for wall mounting it . The only thing I can complain about is the huge power supply that powers it ; I 'm pretty sure it outweighs the switch and it is large enough that if you plug it into the top socket of an outlet it will block the bottom one . Thankfully , Netgear chose to go with prongs that allow it to be inserted upside down in a socket . Additionally , they provided about 5 feet of wire to give plenty of flexibility in locating the switch and I was able to place it in an inconspicuous spot . If you need expand your home network , this little unit will do it in a snap .
5 #### Bought these for my dads car and they fit perfect like the seller said they would :)
5 #### I use it to run to my router and keep my family happy haha thank you for selling this item to me
5 #### Perfect ! Long lasting and great feel . They retain that beautiful acoustic brightness we all love when we change our acoustic strings . Highly recommended .
4 #### Good , that 's what I need it for my digital piano connecting to my iphone 5s . I received it quick fast do n't have to wait too long .
4 #### This case is a good value for the price ; however , a Blackberry Storm will not fit into it if you have an outer skell on it . Do not order it you have a outer case on your phone .
5 #### I 've had this for several months and have used it about a dozen times . It is good for more than one full charge . Not sure if I could get two charges out of it cause I 've never needed to try . I 've used on both Android & iphones with no problems .
5 #### These strings are fantastic ! Somebody had given me a set of these strings for my guitar awhile back and I had never used them before . I 've always used just standard D'Addario strings and I do n't change strings very frequently unless they get really corroded or they break . Finally I put a set of these on and it changed the sound of my guitar completely , and definitely for the better . It was a much deeper and more full sound . These strings are fantastic ! They also last much longer than the D'Addarios I used to use . So , I got a set for my wife 's guitar and she absolutely loves them too . I definitely recommend these to anybody looking for some acoustic guitar strings .
5 #### So glad to find these here for a reasonable price . None of my local shops carry 10 - 46 with a wound third . I have a ' 69 SG Special that has a non - adjustable bridge which is compensated to intonate a wound rather than plain third so these are essential .
5 #### This is made in the good old USA . I recommend it . Change this on a regular basis and it will surely help keep you from major issues later .
4 #### I bought this as a gift for my dad . It was a good product . Easy to put on and I do feel that it protects the phone pretty well ( he dropped it a few times already ) and the phone seems to be okay still .
4 #### I use Lexol 1013 Leather Conditioner on the leather seats of all of my automobiles . Some professional detailers will tell you that you do n't need a conditioner as long as you do a thorough and effective cleaning of the leather on a regular basis , which I believe , but I like the effect that the conditioner has on the freshly cleaned leather . It is also a good product as it is easy to remove when cleaning the seats the next time . It does a great job and does n't form a layer that makes it hard for the cleaner that I use to penetrate the leather the next time I clean the seats . It does n't leave a harsh smell and I am confident using the product long term based on Lexol 's fine reputation and long history in the industry .
5 #### These are so wonderful to have in the car in the winter . After getting one of these in another color ( but the same brand ) , I decided to pick up a second blanket for my kids to use too while traveling . Here in Minnesota it gets extremely cold and everyone is always fighting over where to have the thermostat set at . By having some of these travel electric blankets in the car , everyone can keep as warm as they want to . This blanket works just as well as my other one and gets just as warm , just as fast . It works exactly like a household electric blanket does . I was so pleased with how well they worked that I bought some as gifts for people for Christmas this year . They were a BIG it and no one knew they even made such a thing . Finally with these we can all be as warm and toasty as we want to be !
3 #### It does the job fine but its too close into the snare and sort of scrapes the rim but the company is n't to blame because i was the one who drilled the holes for it
1 #### At first I thought this was the best mount ever , one mount works with everything ... I 've now had the mount for about 3 months and it has started to leave residue on anything it touches . My hand touched it while removing the device and the residue was on my hand for hours . Product is now useless . I would n't purchase or recommend someone purchase this unless maybe they lived in a cold climate as I think it was the heat that did it in .
5 #### Mogami has never let me down , the only cables I use in my studio .
5 #### Excellent car duster , It is easy to use because of the long handle with plenty of dusting fibers to easily clean the painted surface of a vehicle . WE have a plethora of pine pollen and it cleans it with a wiz . It does n't hurt the painted surfaces in any way .
5 #### I love using this ! ! The only thing when you use it for the 1st time there will be a lot of lint that comes out , I 'm not sure if any way around that .... but after a few usage , it 's good to go ! !
1 #### I put this on the window and it popped off a few times I think because it was so new and stiff . I wanted to put it in the kitchen while washing dishes and cleaning in general to not only answer the phone but hear my music .. I was a little nervous at first but it now is fine . UP DATE pops off never got to use it but a couple of times for an hr or so , Do nt waste money or time on it
5 #### An excellent neutral tone string . I use it as my starting / base layer to get a feel for the natural sound of a new instrument . If a string sounds kind of flat , replace it with a Heliocore . If it sounds a little too bright and tinny , I like the darker timbre of the Pirastro Obligato . My current instrument likes a Zyex G and D , an Obligato A , and a Gold Label E.
5 #### I bought his a while back for my Canon A70 camera and I love it . Lots of room for extra batteries and cards , plenty of cushion to protect your camera . A good buy for me . Still holding up for years of use .
5 #### This bag has stayed intact for several years and through numerous rough journeys and inclement weather . And it 's not heavy .
5 #### I 've had one of these for years and it still continues to works great being run 24 hours a day . Just bought a second one to have an extra one as a spare or in case I need a few more ports . It 's a very reliable unit and comes at a great price .
5 #### This Micro Sd Card is fantastic . I had some fears that it would not work in my Samsung Galaxy II or my Motorolla Xoom Tablet . I ordered 2 cards and the work in both after a format from each respectively , both ssaid that they maxed out at 32 gig cards . I averaged 59.5 gigs of information after the format . I travel frequently and do n't always have the opportunity to stream from a cloud so these cards fit perfectly for the time where I ca nt get a signal on an airplane or a hotel where I ca nt get a signal either . I use them for Mp3 's , photos or video or whatever other storage that I need for documents .
5 #### I use the to split a network cable in one room so that I have 4 ports instead of just one . It works great for this . Plug and play .
5 #### Got this as a spare cable since hubby is always taking them to work & not bringing them home . It works as expected .
5 #### Great package with everything in it , if you want an emergency generator . Not something I 'd recommend if you 're putting together a solar system - but can be re - booted from the car or a set of solar panels . Convenient , neat . Do n't mess with the batteries inside - they 're big and dangerous .
5 #### I will buy another anytime soom . Be awarded ... I bought it second handed and bought a 32 gb one , got the 16 gb version . At least it included a cover . Next time I buy something second handed I will buy the smaller capacity possible . Anyways I give 5 stars cause I love the cover .
3 #### This switch is basic and it works just fine , it is a great value for the price that I paid .
3 #### Much cheaper than they look here but it works For how long we will see ......
5 #### I am not sure what product the people who are leaving negative reviews purchased but I can tell you it is not the " On - Stage SM7211 Professional Folding Orchestral Music Stand " I was concerned about the quality when I placed the order but I said too myself , for 30 bucks I will take a chance . Well I am glad I did and here is my review : Heavy duty nylon collars ( not cheap plastic like others have said ) The metal sheet tray is riveted to a metal bracket which attaches to a heavy duty nylon collar with two screw clamps , one to clamp the sheet tray bracket and the other to clamp the metal tube / post . The ( 3 ) legs are metal tubes with a heavy duty nylon center connector that has a screw clamp as well . All I can say is either ON STAGE upgraded this product in using better materials ( knobs are different then what is in the picture ) or negative reviewers are wrong ! This unit will give years of service even for a professional and I recommend it 100 percent !
5 #### OK Binoculars 101 from a science teacher : First number = magnification , so 18x , which is a LOT of magnification , more like a small telescope than the usual magnification for 50 mm binos , the second number = the diameter of the primary lenses , in millimeters , which is , 7x50 mm or 10x50 mm . 18x50 [ the most magnification made by Canon ] are exactly why the IS system works so well ; before you hit the button , 18x will be very shaky even in the best conditions . When you hit the IS , BOOM ! Its like a giant hand grabbed these and steady them . And 18x will get you really close , but at the price of a smaller Field of View aka how ' wide ' the view is . At 18X its like looking down a straw unless you have excellent optics , which Canon has . The image is excellent , some color fringing but come on we are at the limits of the optics here . Great for nature , ocean viewing , looking for birds and dolphins and The Jersey Devil ! Canon IS aka Image Stabilization is one of the best inventions in optics . I love to use Canon IS lenses . This comes at a cost , in price , and in size . They are surprisingly light .
4 #### screen works as promised and i received the screen with everything listed . keep in mind that the screen image quality is NOT OEM , however , it beats paying $ 200 to an apple store . The glass is not smooth like the orignal screen ( does not have anti - oil coating ) and it feels to be " normal glass " , compared to the original " gorilla glass " . However , its been a few months now and the screen has held up well with a couple of accidents . Note that colors are muted , but you only notice this when side by side with an original screen . Installation was not as hard as people made it out to be , but i am fairly techanically inclined . The easiest way to keep the parts / screws organized will be a piece of tape . I took a length of masking tape and double it upon itself to work like double - sided tape . ( you can write on the tape too for your own notes ) . note that this screen does NOT come with the earpiece screen . I removed the screen from the orignal screen and placed it in place before putting the phone back together . Took me about 30 minutes to do the entire swap . I 'm no longer worried about " if i break my screen again " =)
5 #### I was using a heavier headset for my daily one hour walk . I decided to get something lighter , but thinking I would lose some of the sound , especially the bass . Well , let me tell ' ya , these are by far the BEST headsets I 've ever owned , bar none . And to pay such a low price ? What a deal ! So good I 'm buying two more pairs for my granddaughters . Heck , even if they last only a couple of years , what 's a few bucks ?
5 #### This cabasa is a professional cabasa . Place very easily to shake , roll and smooth with your hand .
5 #### Terrific camera , bought it a few weeks ago , and have n't had much problem with it . I take it anywhere , definitely one of the biggest advantages is the size , it fits in my shorts or jeans pocket with ease . One advice , do buy an extra battery , it runs out really fast , especially if you use the LCD ( which I prefer over the optical viewfinder ) . One thing I wish it had is a battery indicator . Overall , terrific camera , I know there are many cameras out there that have more features than this , but I much prefer this because it is tiny and I wo n't miss any good shots because I forgot to bring it because it 's too big .
5 #### I was super happy when I first received these headphones . The quality of the construction is great ! For the price of the headphones , you are getting a steal ! It comes with a 1/8 " to 1/4 " adapter , and all contacts are gold - plated . The headphones can fold in for easier storage , and the cable is super long , just in case you use it to listen on a sofa(away from your stereo system ) . I am happy on making this purchase for this headphones , and I am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound quality .
5 #### Been using these for my whole career . They work as intended and you get two in the pack !
5 #### The moment I hooked up this antenna my reception improved , I really like it , and highly recommend it , fast shipment too
5 #### Purchased these strings after having tried Blue Steel strings on my son 's acoustic guitar . He prefers the Elixir strings over the Blue Steel strings . He says they last a lot longer and sound better , too .
5 #### I like Lee Oskars . I have only been playing harp for a little more than a year , but I have tried many different brands / makes . Of all the harps I have , I keep finding myself reaching for my Lee Oskars when I play . I like the fact that I can get replacement reed plates and save some money compared to buying a whole new harp . I know people have their own favorite harps . Mine happen to be the Lee Oskars for now .
5 #### what can i say , i can be a homer for Canon , but shoot canon , buy canon . i 'm a canon guy .
4 #### Installed very easily and was afforable . Did nt run into any issue with fitment and worked flawlessly without any issues to this day .
5 #### These are hard to find in stores so I was pleased to get them and move ahead with my filing and office work . Easy to refit into the label maker and they do last for ages . I 'll be back next year or the year after for another packet !
5 #### I love good headphones and most of mine are Sennheisers . However , this KOSS matches well with what I was used to with Sennheiser ( PX100);in portability ( laptop , smarttphone , etc ) ... and probably always has ! . So why did I buy KOSS . Well , I read the reviews and decided that anytime you can buy a product that has a following like these do , and last longer than most headsets do ... and you can send them back and get them repaired for a peanuts ... and they sound as good as Sennheisers ... well need I say more ?
5 #### Got the three pack screen protector for my blackberry 8310 ( even though it says its for 8330 , entire 8300 series should be able to fit it ) , and I am loving it . First of all , I got pack of three for 2.99 ( incl . shipping ) and the quality is great . And secondly , its virtually invisible . I highly recommend this particular product for anyone who owns any blackberry of 8300 series .
5 #### I have n't had it for very long but what can I say , it 's a K&N. I 've used them in the past . Great filters !
5 #### Good price for a quality product with prompt delivery . Will buy from them again .
5 #### I 've used this product on a previous touch screen phone i had . I LOVE it . Anti - fingerprint protection . It does n't give your display the same brilliance as other screen protectors , but you definitely do n't have smudges all of your screen . Will buy for my next cell phone a few years from now .
4 #### First , the sound emanating from these headphones is simply wonderful . They are not boomy , but have clean and tight bass as well as crisp highs , and everything in between sounds equally as nice . The cord coils nicely and does n't tangle , entering the left side of the headset and with a very nice strain relief at the plug on the other end . The " funky mechanics " that I refer to are related to collapsing the headset and the adjustment of the headband . The headband adjustment will not maintain position and slips while putting on or taking off the headphones . I also find myself being ( overly ? ) careful when collapsing / expanding the headphones , but maybe that 's just my paranoia considering the cost . The sound quality is without par in any headphones I have ever had and I would definitely buy another pair IF these do n't fall apart mechanically within the next couple of years .
5 #### My mother in law was so worried she would have to give up her LG Flip phone when her battery stopped taking a charge . She went to a Verizon store & they told her they do n't make the replacement batteries anymore & tried to sell her a new phone ! Talk about taking advantage of someone ! Luckily she called me so I could help her out . I did a quick check on Amazon & found these batteries , they were so inexpensive I ordered her 2 of them . She is so happy now . Her phone lasts for 3 - 4 days on a charge again !
4 #### I have been using these in my cars for many years . My complaint is that they do n't seem to last more than a few years . I would n't mind if they were just a little louder also . Some have had the beeper fail , some the bulb . In any event I really like having that extra attention getter when backing out of parking space .
5 #### This radio is the best of its type for the money . The Sangean 505 gives you SSB and a nice fine - tuning knob , but it is considerably more expensive , and also quite a big larger . If all you want is a good , small , AM / FM , basic shortwave radio with a speaker and memory , you ca n't beat this . I find its reception to be quite good , on all 3 bands . As far as battery use , it works very smoothly with rechargables . It has a 3 - segment battery indicator that displays when you first turn it on . When only 1 segment is lit , it means you are getting toward the end ( maybe about 1 hour left ) . At that point , you can charge a second set of batteries and install them when it finally dies . You can also just disregard the battery indicator and wait for it to die , and then charge the second set . As soon as the battery power gets too low , the radio shuts off , but still retains the time and memory station settings . It can run in this low - power mode for hours . In my case , I had 4 nicads in it that died , and it took me 6 hours to charge 4 NiMHs that I use as the 2nd set . The radio 's time and memory settings were still intact when I finally installed the NiMHs ( you have 3 minutes to make the actual switch ) . Very nice !
5 #### these are the best . they rarely break and the string gauges are balanced and comfortable . also , i 'm a fan of worn in strings.they still sound great after a month of playing . ernie ball slinky 's sound great when you first put them on but would break after 2 gigs . i played them for 10 years . then i switched to daddario for 2 . they did n't do much for me in the end . they felt kinda generic . then i moved on to BOOMERS and they BOOM . long lasting , built tough , and they sound great from the minute you put them on til ... i guess til you feel like putting new ones on , because they wo n't break ! ( GHS BOOMERS 11 - 50 )
5 #### Finally spent the money on a nice creeper , and it has been worth it . My greatest compliment is no pinch points and it does n't tip when you lay down or get up . Would highly recommend ! !
5 #### I found these in a box recently , the ear foam cushions were dissolved . Cursing the " cheap " materials , and why oh why do they make the cushions self destruct after some period of time . Then I looked up replacement cushions , which they make ..... I was shocked to find I bought these in 2002 . 13 years is a lot for anything to last now a days . Considering I used these in traveling , and with everything in traveling , they were not treated with kid gloves . The sound quality of these were good , I bought the replacement foam ( made by Koss ) just because it seemed like the right thing to do after cursing them . It says here that Amazon still sells them . I find that hard to believe given their cost compared to what you can buy now a days . But what you buy now will not be around in 13 years . So I have to rate them high just for the longevity . I doubt anyone will read this , but here it is .
4 #### Could use better DIY instructions and a cover plate over the compartment . I used it to install a Boss Audio 508UAB radio in a 2004 Honda Civic EX sedan .
2 #### This is listed to work for my 2001 E350 but it did not work , the plug in my van is different so be careful you check your vehicle before ordering this plug .
5 #### This item works perfectly for what I need it to do . It allows me to connect a Bluetooth mouse to my galaxy tab 4 as well as my external hard drive without any problems . I would recommend this product for any micro usb to usb connections
4 #### Wow , I ordered on a Sunday AM and the product arrived before 8 PM ! I had -- returned elsewhere -- a Jensen cassette player that was a real disappointment . This Panasonic is head and shoulders above that tinny - sounding one . And , boy , did I luck out : This sells for $ 215 on Amazon , but they had a used ( returned ) one for $ 50 total and it works great ! But I 'm looking for a suitable exterior mic for even better quality sound and to reach farther into a " chorus " of singers . Love it ! Oops , just discovered that the microphone input does not work . I used a mic that was working on a similar machine . This was a used / returned item and , apparently , neither thoroughly checked out nor fully / honestly disclosed by the person who returned it : Maybe that is why it was listed as " good " instead of " very good"--thus , I lowered its rating to a B / four stars . I give two stars to the person who returned the item without fully / honestly disclosing this defect , had it been known .
3 #### For the price , who can resist ? It offers the zoom you need at an affordable price . Yes at 300 mm the optics are a little iffy and image stabilization would be a plus , but you get what you pay for . I got this lens new for $ 105 so I 'm not one to complain about its optical performance . I get the zoom I need and I 'm content . I 'll find ways to work out the hand - held shakiness at 300 mm by making sure I can have a fast shutter speed . Obviously you ca n't correct it 's optical quality , so what I recommend ; get the lens now if you need the zoom and sell it when you 're ready to buy a better telephoto zoom . If you do n't need the zoom now ; keep saving for a higher quality lens .
5 #### This may not work for you if you have a thick screen protector ( especially those made of glass ) . I 've had this for almost 2 years now and have dropped my 4S dozens of times . All is good !
5 #### Great stand for the money . Have 3 more on my home kit . For gigging , I 'd recommend a more heavy duty stand , but for a kit that does n't this stand is the perfect boom or straight stand for the job .
5 #### It is important to change the fuel filter at the recommended intervals . If you think you are saving money by not changing it , wait until not changing it causes your fuel injection system to crash . $ $ $ $ $ ! WOW ! !
4 #### I like the color coding of the power strip and it 's a better strip than most cheap strips found in regular retail stores . Cords are good quality . I prefer Monster cables to cheaper makes and models .
2 #### I have an iPhone 4 from Verizon , and I do n't know if is any different from the one from ATnT physically , but the lock button is on the top of the phone on the right side . This cover does not have a hole for the lock button , and is presses it down so your phone is constantly asking you to power off . It is generally an extremely cute cover and I 'm sad that I wo n't be able to use it .
5 #### this is a great little phone , I gave to my fam for a gift cause i have the newer model ... great on battery life , well longer than the iphone 4 and 5 but the battery is still low .. it is just longer than the other two . great shipping time I like
5 #### If you plan on using this make sure there 's no wind or do this indoors with ventilation .
4 #### I did n't read the reviews before buying this pedal and so I was unaware of the always - on vs always off issues that people are having with some keyboards . Luckily , the pedal works perfectly with my MIDI controller , which is an old Roland PC-180A.
5 #### I have had nothing but love for my phones , i am not a person who has to be tether to the interanet 27 - 7 , i love the key pad and love that it is unlocked , screw you cincinnati bell with your high cell phone costs
5 #### Fit nice , easy to install . Bought for 1999 ford f 150
5 #### When I 'm traveling down life 's highway on a dark and stormy night , I do n't want to worry about if my radio will work or not . I chose this radio because I wanted a cheaper option that would be reliable and last for years . So far , after about a year of use -- it 's still working great ! Uniden has always been a great brand in the CB community , with performance probably a tad bit higher than the Cobras , etc . Although this model DOES NOT have an SWF meter , it 's small size was my main requirement -- so I used a portable SWF meter ( also purchased from Amazon ) to tune the radio and my Firestik antenna . No issues at all , and the truckers tell me they can hear me loud and clear when I 'm traveling down life 's highway !
4 #### Seems working but not 100 % sure it solved the problem . Half bottle goes to the engine through vacuum pipe , half pours directly to the tank . got some white smog out of the exhaustion pipe . I thought I felt the engine running smoother than before but not significantly . May do the same procedure again then I 'm afraid it is going to clog up catalytic converter . Need to research more
5 #### You will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back , and that you ca n't get them in your ears fast enough ... Koss obviously made great improvements to the foam . THE FOAM IS NOW SLOW RECOVERY , meaning you can get it into your ear . This alleviates the only real downside to the product .
5 #### I 'm a photographer , and a few months ago I was wondering how come binoculars do n't have the same image stabilization that camera lenses do . Duh ! So I did a search , and was startled to find that the same company that makes my camera lenses , Canon , also makes Image Stabilized binoculars . Wow . What a difference . Not only can I now see my subject without jitters , but I find it much easier to focus accurately when the image is n't jumping all over the place . Initially it 's a little awkward getting used to holding down the IS button with one hand while focusing with the other , but once you get used to it it 's not a problem . The only down - side is that , if you hand your binoculars off to a guest , you have to explain how to use them to full advantage . I expect that , for several thousand dollars , you could get a better image quality ; I would not find this optical instrument acceptable for photography . As binoculars , however , it 's superb . Also , I do n't believe that , without the IS , I could even pick out the very slight fringing around the subject .
5 #### This item took a long time to get but is light weight and bright .
5 #### This is great to use when you traveling or when your iPhone is low on power but you ca n't be near an outlet . I think that the flashlight is superfluous , but the rest of the device is fantastic !
5 #### This music stand is a very heavy , well made stand . Well worth the money !
5 #### Pin is strong and works just as it should be . Highly recommended . Just make sure to keep in a place easy to find so you wo n't lose it .
5 #### Hello , I think I paid about seven dollars for this cable . At Staples , they did n't have ten foot ones , so I would have had to buy two short ones for about $ 20 each . And it 's a Belkin , probably the best in the market . Thank you Amazon , Bill Moore
5 #### Very sturdy , and exactly as pictured . Best of all many thanks for the lightning shipping ! ! ! !
4 #### Bought this in 2011 . Prime usage is for long interstate drives to monitor traffic . I drive an 800 mile one way trip about 8 times a year . A major traffic jam is frequent . This enables me to listen and communicate with the truckers on the nature of the jam , how long it will take to get around , good alternate routes .
3 #### Kind of bulky for a silverado 1500 . I cut mine and glued two pieces to my motorcycle lift .
1 #### Terrible it came with many scratches to the screen , and after an hour of using it the screen became very distorted . I normally do n't tell people not to buy something but trust me save your money and get some thing else .
5 #### Any competent drummer should be able to play with any pair of sticks , but we can also tell the difference between them . These are basically the 5B with an extra half inch in length . I 've got a short wingspan , so every little bit helps . It 's easy to rock out on these sticks , but they are n't so beefy as to make one instinctively want to smash . Good stuff . Good sticks . Good company .
1 #### you get what you pay for .... you pay cheap because it is cheap .... the leather texture is some sort of flimsy ( not to mention ) thin covering that peeled off simply trying to put this on my belt . its a basic pouch , flap , magnet design . To add insult to injury the magnet is n't even a strong one . do n't know how many times my phone fell out of the case from actions as simple as getting into my truck and having it bump into the seat .
5 #### I like it a lot i used it few times and it 's great
4 #### Thought I was buying a higher grade of Fuji but it is plain . Still Fuji is good and you ca n't buy it across the counter anymore so I am just glad to have it .
5 #### I use my Motorola 2 - way Radios when I do Road Rallies in my Mini Cooper . Being able to leave the radio in the cup holder and have the microphone / speaker clipped to my seatbelt puts the sound where I need it and makes it safer and more convenient to communicate with others . Sound quality inbound and outbound is crystal clear and loud enough to hear over the engine , radio and open windows . Can not imagine using the radios without the additional microphone
4 #### WORKS LIKE EXPECTED . MANUFACTURE WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THE WARRANTY . HAD TO REPLACE .
4 #### This is my first Bluetooth headset so I was n't quite sure what to expect . The Samsung came with detachable earhooks and earbuds meant that I could conform it pretty well to fit my left ear . I am not sure if other Bluetooth headsets come with this sort of customizable option , but for me , the Samsung fits pretty flawlessly after some trial and error . Call quality on my end is good , but not amazing . I find it pretty easy to adjust the volume , which is nice . Call quality for the person on the other end of the phone call varies . I live in a city , and when walking through high traffic areas , or during a windy day , the caller on the other end has trouble hearing me . It 's definitely not perfect , but for the price , it works well . It is sleek in design and nice - looking ( or as nice as a headset can look , really ) . I definitely appreciate having another hand free to carry groceries !
5 #### Nice sticks as always , exactly what you 'd expect from a reputable company like Vic Firth .
5 #### Best product for the money , works perfectly and you ca n't get it any cheaper than here . Set it and forget it , never moves .
5 #### I really like the size / shape and ease of use of this external battery . I 've purchased 5 previous external battery packs , and this one is my favorite . It even has a built in flashlight and laser pointer . Really easy to charge and use and the small profile is perfect for travel .
5 #### its a great place to set my phone to charge and I can see my alarm on my phone , very nice
5 #### I m an amateur at the acoustic , I love these strings . They feel great and sound great , and with the nanoweb coating , they last FOREVER ! I ve stuck with elixirs for years , and will continue to :)
5 #### This canon bag is great . It fits the camera very well and stores all the memory cards / batteries you could ever want . In terms of durability , I 've had no issues with the bag breaking , ripping , wearing out , or anything like that . It seems like very durable material . Do n't know if it 's water proof or resistant , I 've never gotten it wet ( and have no plans to get this or my camera anywhere near water ) yeah that 's about it . It 's a camera bag . If you have any questions , I can answer them .
5 #### These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever used . Very comfortable and work great !
3 #### Decent picks cheap here on amazon . Downside , when i got my package the box wazthe size of a shoebox Nd only 8 picks inside . Amazon refunded my order since these were on backorder . So customer service took care of it . Beware , hopefully you get all 12 when you buy this .
5 #### This is an excellent phone . Great reception , great sound , the speakerphone works , the speech recognition works ( even in a car , even with my young son 's voice ) . Also pairs easily with Bluetooth headsets . I ca n't speak for the camera or the browser or most of the other functions . Sorry , I do n't use them .
5 #### Very good product just as described . You will definitely need the pin wrench tool . Instructions were good except beware one or both of the support brackets will often times be frozen and possibly require yet another tool to complete the project ( Marine Steering Support Bracket Puller ) . Before purchasing this extra tool for $ 77 , try using a small sledge hammer and block of wood to dislodge the support brackets .
5 #### Like most people I have purchased multiple Bluetooth headsets and struggled with poor reception , I ca n't hear the caller or they ca n't hear me . This Plantronics Voyager 510 headset did n't have any of these problems . The device simply worked and I have used it for years . The headset will operate for 6 hours of talk time and 100 hours of standby time and is ideal for me to use when traveling and especially when driving . The noise canceling microphone worked well in that people could hear me but not all the background noise like wind or rain on the windshield . The earpiece is comfortable to wear and is light enough that you forget you have it on . The headset has the feature to operate with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously and the smart technology feature connects you to the proper device with a touch of a button . The headset boom swivels to fit the location that is best for you and even folds into a small form for easy storage . The head set will operate up to 33 feet from your Bluetooth device so if your phone is in your briefcase or in the back seat of the car you can still take calls . The unit also features Adaptive Frequency Hopping to find a free channel to avoid interference from other WIFI / WLAN sources . I have tried about 10 Bluetooth devices over the years and this one was simply the one that performed the best .
5 #### Works great on gas hoses . Make sure to wipe off excess as it never completely dries .
5 #### Does a good job . No issues thus far . Read the priming guide . I suspect a lot of the ' issues ' people have are because they are n't paying attention to recommendations . The tip does ' hold tightly ' but I had no real issue removing it . I do not look on this as a negative . Make sure you tighten the tip onto the hose well . It come separately , and initially , I did not tighten it as well as I needed .
5 #### The clear case found in the stores is over 20 bucks and is just that , no clip or anything . I got this for my wife and she loves it , especially the fact that it has a clip . Hands down worth every penny .
5 #### Exceeded the use for what I needed .... Very good cord for the price .... The " 5e " is for extra heavy duty wire gauge . Hooks up in a snap and does n't come out of the plug unless you need it to .... The blue color is just a visual factor for cord ID , witch is good when you have lots of cords together ..... The end plug is made with very good quality .... Thanks for sending it to me the way you did , I received it one day before the promised date ...
5 #### I tend to drop picks from time to time and it 's nice to have them at the ready when the time arises . This was a basket filler when I needed to get to $ 25 for my free shipping one day but I find it very useful and use it every time I play . Do n't know why I waited so long to get one ..
1 #### Collee students should not have to buy these , we have smartphones for a reeason .
5 #### Works great , uses easy to find AAA batteries , love the blue color , would definitely buy again , great gift for the readers you know too .
5 #### Great strings ! ! I stick to this brand . Great quality and great price !
5 #### Just got my N8 and i 'm very happy . The features on this phone are wonderful . The touchscreen works like a gem and with all the apps that are available for download you will never be bored .
5 #### Great Quality ! Perfect Fit ! Installed in less than 5 minutes on my 1998 S10 .
4 #### My work is , for the most part , data entry . As so , I listen to my Ipod for nearly 8 hours each day while I work . I was using the ear buds that came with the player , but wanted to get a set of headphones that had better range , but were not too expensive . After doing my research on the net , I found these Porta Pro headphones . All i can say is Wow ! Incredible sound , hits on both highs and lows . They are also comfortable to wear , and if you wear them a little looser than one would normally wear them , you forget you have them on . Add to this the lifetime warranty .... get a pair ! Highly recommended !
2 #### If you use this stuff make sure you cover the paint around your top . I did not find it to repel the ran as I expected . I have a small top and will not use this product again .
1 #### These do not work well . You can not see the mirror portion and it is very difficult to apply . I would not try a product similar to this again in the future .
5 #### Sturdy product . Well built and works well on standard speaker tripods . You might need to add thickness to the mounting spot by applying black tape . I mounted my Swarm5FX below a Chauvet 4Bar and it looks awesome !
5 #### I bought this card for a 3D camcordar , wich demands FAST access . It delievers . And I 'm using also on a canon DLR 20.6mp , which does need fast access too . Nothing to complain at all .
4 #### They are large enough to cover and are quite thick . Used on a pickup had to trim alittle , but I knew that . Highly recommend
4 #### Heavily built , has stood the test of time and torture .
5 #### LOVE this product . It protects your screen and does n't impede the sensitivity of the touch screen . It 's a little more difficult to put on but once it 's there it 's fantastic . It you ever have any problems the company it very easy to work with . These covers have a lifetime guarantee . All you need to do is register your purchase and if you ever have an issue with your cover just contact them and they will send a replacement all it will cost you is shipping . YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT .
5 #### Bought three of these to detect motion around the deck and pool area and activate several flood lights and wall sconce units simultaneously . The instructions say this has to be wired to a switched circuit , but I have no idea why . Worked fine coming right off a live circuit . Coverage is probably a little less than 180d but it worked well for me . The instructions do n't cover this ... If you want to add multiple sensors to a single ( or multiple lights ) simply get some 14/3+G wire and wire it up like you would a 3 way switch ( or get an electrician to do it ) . I love the idea that we 've got such broad motion detection coverage from the three sensors and all the lighting works simultaneously . Little more complicated ( and expensive ) wiring job , but much better for me than having individual units that work independently .
5 #### I originally bought the wireless remote . But it ended up not working for my camera . So I got this instead . It works perfectly .
5 #### I used this to refurbish a caliper hole in a 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan knuckle . It felt pretty solid and the Caravan stopped well for the first few months . Since the Caravan has been stolen I ca n't talk about long - term performance .
3 #### It added noise to the recording and was extremely difficult to remove . The sound ' warming ' effect was noticeable but the noise it added was worse .
5 #### K&N great product to get a few extra hp on the acceleration . Part came in on time and was packaged well . Great buy .
5 #### I love the sound of these mufflers . Talk about throaty ! I have them on a 72 Ford p / u with a 390 ... it 's almost too loud ! lol
5 #### Fantastic Product . Keep in mind , this is a glaze , not a compound of polish . When you read " Swirl Mark remover " , they are not referring to swirl marks from a carwash or anything like that , they are referring to swirl marks from a buffer after polishing . You need to use polish before this product ! ! ! Minimum Process for this product should be : 1 . Clay Bar 2 . Polish 3 . This Product 4 . Wax
5 #### These are the best cables out there , the switch is awesome and lasts a long time . I have another one that is twelve years old and functions like new . nice job Planet Waves .
5 #### Fast shipping Great service . Would recommend all the way . Thank you
1 #### This purchase was very disappointing . It did n't fit the phone and I hate that I ca n't send it back to China . It 's still nice however
4 #### This Motorola Roadster 2 purchased through Amazon works as described . Some callers or people that I call , have asked if I was on a different phone . When asked what makes them think that , their reply was , I sound different , sounds like I 'm talking through a two foot long piece of 2 inch pvc pipe . These callers / contacts are some of the more perticular people I speek with on a regular basis . I have used two other signal to fm car radio before with out satisfaction . I was somewhat excited that Motorola had a better idea . I 'm thinking the problem is not with the manufacter , but is with the fact there are just no truly empty frequencies anymore . ( large cities - small towns ) My only reason to not rate this item at 5 stars is the limited use of signal to fm radio . Produst works well for handsfree communicating .
4 #### Dunlop 44P100 1.0 mm Nylon Standard Guitar ... -- yes , as one who changes Picks for tone and feel , this is a cross between wood , and bone or antler as I use it . I use the Round Corner and at an angle and seek a softer chime with some attack . And the thickness is purely for grip for me and only somewhat effects tone in how I use it . Thinner would give more attack , --with how " i " strum . So , for this price ... and me needing them everywhere , I do n't think anyone will go wrong trying them , living with them for a while .
5 #### What can I say ? Easy to tune , great sound , affordable . These are just great . I have n't compared them to any Remo products yet , but I ca n't imagine any other drum head in existence being much better than these . Whether you 're after a metal sound or more of a tonal kit , these heads will get you to where you 're going .
5 #### This product was over expected than i thought . It was the best among the best . I did n't regret at all .
5 #### This is a game changer when it comes to changing oil . Worked flawlessly after only 30 pumps , amazing time saver .
5 #### Works great to flush systems out with ... Glad I picked it up .
3 #### I picked this unit up in addition to one of their closed oil change pans . Overall , this does what it is made to do : Hold Oil ! Transferring it to another container can be a pain , but for the price , it gets the job done .
5 #### I have exclusively used D'Addario strings since I discovered them back in the 80 's
1 #### When zipped too tight , or on hard corners they snap in half . Great price , unfortunately the plastic is poor quality .
5 #### It 's hard to even play a new guitar now without putting these on first ... Quick and easy to install and amazing to use at practice or gigs !
5 #### I was lured into trying these a while ago by the implication these string would offer punchy depth , but with a light of brightness as well . Turns out , it was true . Been using them ever since .
4 #### the coating on this strings make it a bit harder to play for me , kinda slippery . also the sound is a little more muted than other strings i 've used . not good for finger style of playing
5 #### Purchased this item for a flight from NM to Florida so that I could use and charge my devices while on the plane . Worked great and I have used it numerous times afterwards . Great compact design and works great with both tablets as well as smart phones .
4 #### Made well for a noc - off , but would n't fit my daughters arm . It wounldn't adjust that small . I had to take it to a taylor . Works great now , but cost me $ 8.00 for the repair .
5 #### I ca n't find a compelling reason to recommend a higher priced model than this one . Sound and picture as rich as can be . Remote features are excellent , allowing for more tricks than you 'll use . Chose this after too many negative reviews of low price Sony models ( I 'm sure everything is fixed , but I was n't going to take a chance over the holidays ) . Was n't a Toshiba fan before this purchase ( simple Sony prejudice ) but now I 'm willing to spend the big bucks on one of their large TV 's . You 'll enjoy this player and its price .
5 #### Metra is the # 1 choice for all my installs . I have been installing for 30 years and tried all the brands available for install accessories . Metra is the best I 've ever used .
4 #### almost too strong ; hard to operate on a thick neck ; however built very well ; looks good ; good value ; maybe will loosen up after use
5 #### If you want to restore the new tire look , this is the stuff . Easy to use . If you have curb scrapes just stiff brush the tire with car soap and water , dry tire and apply . This does not give you that glaring shine nor is it formulated to . The tires look as new when done . Great product .
4 #### I like these , they sound good , are priced reasonable , block out all other sound . My only complaint is that I ca nt find the soft replacement ear buds . I have purchased ones that are said to be replacements but they seem harder & are not as easy to roll . Think I will need to buy a new pair in order to get the soft ones .
5 #### I used to buy cables like this to bring a USB jack from my docked laptop out onto my desk where I could easily plug in a flash drive . I found that the very low cost cables used smaller gauge wires which affected their ability to provide power to the flash drive . In fact , the flash drive would not work at all in that case . This is a still inexpensive , but higher quality cable that does the job . If you are sure you wo n't need to transfer power with your extension cable , say between an AC powered external hard drive , and a laptop , then try the cheaper cables . Otherwise , you need not search for anything besides what you 've found here .
4 #### Excellent service , product shipped pretty quickly and was packaged well so everything arrived intact . My only disappointment is that since I 'm not an experienced relaxer buyer , ( this was only my second purchase ) I did n't realize the set was not complete . The package came with only Steps 2 and 4 of the process . The other steps should either be included in the package or buyers should be advised that they still need to get Step 1 ( scalp protector ) and Step 3 ( post relaxing conditioner ) . It really is an inconvenience not being able to use right away . Other that everything was excellent .
4 #### I ordered this product for my phone . It was fairly easy to put on , but if you handle it much it does not stick well . You must be careful not to touch the sticky part of the product or then it will not adhere to the phone . I found that the portion around the keypad did not adhere well but then that could well have been my inept application . I admit to touching the sticky part .
5 #### Have not used yet . Never had any problems with K&N products .
5 #### D'Addario strings are , in my opinion , the best strings on the market today . They stay in tune and maintain their tone under a plethora of conditions that would , in my experience , leave other strings less than . I have tried ever string , ever gimmick ( deep freeze ) out there and always came back to D'Addario . What makes the 110Ws special or different is that the G or 3rd string is wound which I find easier to do pull - offs , especially multiple pull - offs . D'Addario are and have been the only strings I have used for years .
5 #### The white Wiremold C110 1 - channel CordMate Kit is perfect for hiding a power cord . It looks very neat and is almost invisible on an off - white wall . I ran mine along the top of a baseboard and then up the corner of the walls . The glue under the peel off label is sufficient to hold both vertical and horizontal runs in place .
5 #### Used to clean my CD player in the factory BOSE stereo in my 2004 Corvette WORKED better than expected . The reason I said better than expected is I had already tried 3 other brands / types of cd player cleaners NONE of them worked . The Allsop CD - drive cleaner worked and I recommend before you buy any other cleaner you try this one . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### These cables work great just like they should . They are flexible and seat properly in the connector jacks .
4 #### I used this tool to install under drive pulleys . I tried numerous other methods to remove my crankshaft pulley to no avail . This tool did what a 750lbft impact wrench could not ! The tool is descent quality and seems well built . It made a seemingly impossible job possible . I used it on a later model k series engine by the way .
4 #### It suits my desktop recording needs perfectly . I would definitely order other cables made by Hosa . All in all a very good cable .
5 #### Not much to say on this one . It works just like all metra kits and harnesses . Pro tip for DIYers . You can visit modifiedlife.com and search for your car . They have detailed wiring diagrams to match your factory audio wires to this one .
5 #### This product came from the seller as advertised and on time . The product works exceptionally well with both our iPhone 3 G and iPhone 4 ( which now requires a case to prevent antenna blocking ) . I bought two and they work just as I needed to dock my iPhones to PCs .
4 #### I almost NEVER do without my Ernies - they shine sonically and feel perfect longer than any strings I use - and I am a string eating machine .
4 #### Did n't work right out of the box , so I returned it for refund . UPDATE : After I had returned this horn I found that there was a problem with the wiring harness I was testing it on . The horn PROBABLY was OK , so I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars . Sorry for the misinformation .
5 #### Folks let me be honest , i ran through several loops till i put the money on this adapter ! 1 . i tried several in car radio wave adapters in car radio listing to my iPod video ( all of them are crap ! ) i wasted 70bucks ) 2 . I tried several no Brand cassette adapters ( crap ! i wasted like 20 bucks on no name version ) I say if u are an audiophile in your car and your iPod is a must everyday , get this Maxell adapter ! its the only one i found to work fantastically on a lexus GS300 and a Honda and a Merc and Toyota factory installed players . This stuff i think has improved over the years . I do n't hear any hissing even during classical performances !
5 #### I have bought a iGo universal car charger several years ago and have been buying new tips instead of the whole charger and I have never had a bad tip or have the charger go bad . iGo makes high quality chargers and tips , highly recommended !
5 #### Great mini greese gun . This lives permanntly on my boat for occasional re - greasing of the steering parts and pins for the outboard . Compact size makes it easy to get into tight places .
3 #### Its a lot cheaper call me lazy . I got this to cover a dead outlet from the kids messing with the wires that were exposed .
5 #### will fit on a 2015 Mazda Cx5 , sure looks good .- ) ) )
5 #### I love this product . I t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast , so y do n't have to life it over your head . Well worth the price .
4 #### These were easy enough to install . I used a hacksaw to cut them ( easily ) and a file to file the frayed edges and they look great . I did have them fall down off the wall once or twice so far , but after pressing them back on they seem to be holding up okay . No regrets . If I need some more in the future I 'll probably buy another set .
3 #### This lens is a popular entry level zoom . For the money you get a pretty big zoom range and ok quality in good light . For a little more you can get the EF 100 - 300 f/4.5 - 5.6 . The 100 - 300 features ring - type USM which allows full - time manual focus -- that means you can adjust the focus manually without switching to manual mode . Also the focus is quicker and quieter without rotating or extending the front element so the use of circular polarizers is easier . If you can afford the extra money , I would recommend the 100 - 300 as a budget telephoto zoom . If not , this one is ok but not good .
5 #### When I lived in Sweden , about 50 % of the population had these headphones . They were extremely popular . Now I know why ! The sound quality on these things is amazing , comparable to $ 50 + headphones . The only headphones I have listened to so far that have better sound quality are some more expensive Sennheiser headsets . The bass is really booming , and there is crisp treble and pretty nice midrange . They are extremely portable too . I can fit them in the pockets of my shorts when folded up . Pretty durable cable too , and it does n't twist . I highly recommend these !
5 #### I am a constant reader so having a book lamp is important and I really like this one . Not heavy so its perfect for paper backs and hardbacks . The level of light given off is awesome too . Buying as gifts .
3 #### Just ok . I play more with a pick than with fingers and find that with these they sound better when playing just fingers . The bottom sounds lacking and the stings seem a bit on the thick side . I prefer a true lightweight and these seem more medium weight . They do seem to have less squeaking than the stings they did replace .
5 #### Cleans my bed cover pretty good , looks like new after 3 years of neglect !
4 #### Started towing a travel trailer and required mirrors that could see past the trailer . These have worked well for 4 years and roughly 10,000 miles . The first time attaching them the angled portion that fits over the weather strip of the window would either catch or scrap against the window as it was raised . I bent each " tab " a little more and they work fine . After the first mirror adjustment they stay in place even after opening and closing the doors many times . After a day of rain one moved while raising the window , the web strap will stretch a little when wet .
5 #### I had the MDR - V6s in the early 1990s ... loved them but for some dumb reason replaced them with MDR - V600s . I was never happy with the V600s and now 20 years later just replaced them with the MDR - V6 . Right out of the box ... instant clarity , deep accurate bass , an articulate musical sound . Not sure what the V6 has that makes it so good .
5 #### Drove 2200 miles towing a 31 foot camper with these mirrors , great visibility and rock solid . Highly recommended .
5 #### Price these at guitar center and you will buy from amazon .
5 #### G2 , G1 and EC2 's are the only heads I put on my kits . These resonate for days on floor drums , rich sound , durable , greatfor live and recording .
5 #### Spitballs are the best :) it was fun to blow the sponges through the horn . They went through with ease . worth it for the minor cleaning they provide .
5 #### This works great what I have been looking for love it .
5 #### I can sit comfortably on my bed without disturbing anyone . I was thinking about getting wireless headphones but this was cheaper and a better solution .
5 #### Great product , nice desing and good price . Great product , nice desing and good price . Great product , nice desing and good price .
5 #### Great product for underwater application on boats.used it to install new drain plug .
5 #### It is Gibson . Perfect fit and color for my Gibson Les Paul 60 's Tribute as expected . Love the amber color over gold ... much richer looking on tobacco sunburst .
5 #### Love it , very sturdy , holds phone in place even on rough roads .
5 #### These are not Thule brand , but fit Thule and work fine . I had a problem ( turned out to be user error ) and Aaron form the company took my call and was very helpful . I bought an 8 lock set , all keyed ot the same kaey and they sent me 8 keys so i have plenty of spares .
2 #### What a shock I had when I started reading this . None of the reviews mentioned that this was filled with erotica .
3 #### where is the vss located ? want more info . on steering system ? not enough wiring diagrams on more important systems !
5 #### Fit my spare tire nice and snug . My spare was not a looker and this cover hides it very well and looks great .
1 #### Even on the package it states that it is made for eTrex Vista and it is designed by Garmin . Is it possible they do n't know their own product ? Some one should pay for this , Ah I forgot that is me ..... & nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Garmin - Bicycle - Mount - for - eTrex - and - Summit-010 - 10267 - 00 / dp / B00004VX15 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Garmin Bicycle Mount for eTrex and Summit ( 010 - 10267 - 00)</a >
5 #### The Audio - Technica ATH - M20 Professional Studio Monitor Stereo Headphones are just what I needed in my studio . They have great ear pads and stay comfortable even after hours of use . They have great sound and reproduce the music with all the lows and highs intac . Great product for the money and it did come with a 1/4 " adapter plug and a long spiral cable as indicated . Get one today ! ! ! !
1 #### Monster stakes out a claim as being the best in audio equipment . But this surge protector does not live up to the brand name . After a year or two of use , only two of the six outlets work . When I began to have the problem and contacted Monster , I found myself on hold forever again and again and was provided with no helpful solution to my problem or easy way to have the device replaced . I have other no - name brand surge protectors that have been rocking strong since the 1980s . This one has been a disappointment . The only reason I 'm on Amazon today is that I 'm shopping to REPLACE this one .
5 #### Been using this cable to connect my ps3 to ubuntu pc to share internet for a year or so now , no complaints .
4 #### First off , this will work as advertised . But the quality of the signal is lacking . I get static on every frequency . Aside from that , this works on the iPod Touch 2 g
4 #### Pros : - Sound is decent for its price - Very compact when folded and placed in case ; great for traveling . Cons : - No noise cancellation - When adjusting , band gets separated causing hair to get stuck in the band ; quite painful . Notes : - To adjust without worrying about hair , it 's best to adjust it to the maximum length and then place it on your head and push the sides of the metal bands together until it fits .
5 #### Purchased with maxcraft 500 piece assortment of rivets for some small home projects . This rivet tool works really well and is extremely durable . The swivel head is simply amazing , I 'm not sure how I ever managed without it .
5 #### Order these for my daughter ... she never complains about the quality . Package always arrives on time .
5 #### This works . It 's a hunk of steel , very beefy . Took me 2 minutes to install . This fixed all the rattle and sway on my cargo flat .
1 #### Thought it d be worthwhile to upgrade cables , but I do n't see a difference . Not a positive one anyways . I have this hooked into a nice 47 " 120hz Vizio and I see no better screen than I got from the standard cables with the Wii set to widescreen . The Wii is n't capable of better than 480 , so do n't expect miracles .
2 #### Received a damaged steering wheel . Even the stitching is coming out on a new product . How is this possible ?
5 #### RECEIVED 7 - 28 - 17 OIL CAN GOLDEN ROD 707 FLEX SPOUT MADE IN THE U.S.A
5 #### I 've used many of these switches in the past . Never a problem , they always just work .
5 #### Finally had to change the strings on my new guitar and so finally had cause to use my new string winder . Performed it 's function perfectly . My wife always used to nag me about cutting the left over strings on the head of my guitar . So now at least she wo n't nag me anymore about that ! :) Peg puller , string cutter and the peg winder all work perfectly .
3 #### As far as the audio quality is concerned , I 'm well satisfied with this headset . I use it almost continuously when I 'm working in my office . The head band , however , is not very well made . It uses a friction mechanism that does not hold it in position so unless you can use it fully extended it may not work well for you .
5 #### This is an excellent , easy playing mouthpiece for classical saxophone playing . Even though this is the largest opening for this model ( AL5 ) , it 's still relative small compared to other mouthpieces , and required a jump up to a stronger reed ( Hemke 3 ) . But even with that , it plays great . I have purchased and played many mouthpieces in the last few years ( Vandoren , Selmer , Meyer , Rico , and Otto Link ) and can say that this is the best playing of the bunch . Very even throughout the entire range , with excellent altissimo response . Have played it on both Selmer Mark VI and newer AS42 , and sounds good on both .
2 #### It 's ok . Not great . For it to work the car has to be completely cool . If you try to use it when the car has been in the sun , the brush smears wax or something like that and it 's hard to get it off the finish . Along with that , it spreads lint all over the car , and you have to get a cloth , to try and wipe it off . I am not a fan of the duster . If you want to clean your car , get a cloth and some detail spray . It works better and you will be happier with the results . The cal duster is too much effort .
5 #### Just as advertised . Arrived quickly . Seems to have fixed the tracking problem on a very old VCR with many hours use .
3 #### Product comes as described and performs well . I have n't had it very long , so I do n't know how long it 'll last . I question it 's durability because it feels pretty cheap and is entirely plastic . I also doubt that it 's designed to take any damage , because it 's a poorly designed product . The cable hangs down from the bottom of the light and makes it really tacky . There 's no way for the cable through the back without taking it apart(which i 'd rather not do yet ) The plate over it that makes the dodge logo is also pretty cheap . You could probably replicate this product yourself with a cheap brake light from walmart($5 to $ 15 ) , A dodge stencil(or sticker ) , and black spray paint . Although everything I 've said has been negative thus far , I do n't regret the purchase , it just did n't make my expectations . Pros ; It 's bright Cons ; Made of plastic and the Wire hangs from the bottom of the light . Summary ; bad enough not to buy again , but not bad enough to return
5 #### This cord is great . Works well and is plenty long enough to suit my needs . No problems with this item .
5 #### Great sounding head ! No muffling required . Creates the perfect balance between open and muffled .
2 #### I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing . The reeds are fairly consistent , and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds ( teacher , student , school , parent ... ) . The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed , as long as they are not pushed in too far . However , the number 2 is reed is quite soft in my opinion . I have always started my middle school students on 2 1/2s , and have had plenty of success . I would have students try making sound on a 2 1/2 first and then go down only if students really struggle making a sound .
1 #### DO NOT BUY . This thing has absolutely no effect on squirrels or crickets . All it does is produce blue light .
5 #### I love these strings . I do n't think my guitars have ever sounded this good . Highly recommended . I 'm using them on a full body acoustic , as well as an Ovation .
4 #### Come covered in a sticky corrosion inhibitor . Brake cleaner removes . Otherwise works like other lock on chucks of similar design .
5 #### Got this for an event , use it all the time . Has a bit of weight to it , but no problems with anything else .
5 #### I have been using this product for twenty years and keep one in each car . " Do n't leave home without one ! "
5 #### I got this because my wife saw my other charger but did n't want a bulk one so i ordered the IMP52D and she loved it ! great to carry on purse or in a pocket . It ususally charges 2 times my Blackberry torch and it also charges my playbook(only once ) and the same amount of charges for the iphone . Also like the fact that has Flash Light and Laser beam , good for those who have dogs or cats lol . For Blackberry users like me you might consider buy a retractable usb cable because the Cable that comes with it wo n't charge Blackberry Torch neither the Playbook , so that was only the issue i had , but apparently this was made for iphone , so iphone and android users , you guys wo n't have the same issues i had . Another thing that i want to point out , the unit does n't come with the power adapter . so use the one that comes with your phone .
3 #### I bought the brother tape titler machine - very good . It is easier than Avery Labels , I ordered the tape brother TZ131 , I thought it was black on white like the sample roll , it is black on clear . I did n't open it . I would really like to just swap the tape for black on white , but it is a problem dealing with internet exchange purchases , It seems such a hassle . I just put it one side . It sour one .
5 #### Been using it to protect my Droid X. Much cheaper here than at a Verizon Store . This skin also keeps the Droid X from slipping on some surfaces . Easy to take off and put on . The cutouts are in the right places . Power , Camera and Volume button are not exposed , but I 've had no issues with that . This dash mount http://www.amazon.com/Heininger-1040-CommuteMate-Black-NavCup/dp/B001XCBDU0 holds the Droid X with this skin on .
5 #### Great wax . Recently had my car painted and this wax goes on easy , wipes off easy and leaves the paint with a super deep shine .
5 #### Super easy to apply . I 've cleaned / oiled my filter three times now and I 've never once had performance issues / check engine lights come on from over / under oiling it . The squeeze oil just sits on my garage shelf as I 'm too afraid to use it and over oil the filter , lol .
5 #### Somewhere , somebody made too many of these and they are still trying to sell them . That 's not necessarily a bad thing , because there 's the saying , " They do n't make them like they used to . " And this is one of those ones they used to make . It will probably outlive me . Only thing is , as you can see in the picture , the connectors are not very low - profile . If that 's what you 're looking for then this is n't your cable . Otherwise , the sturdy form - factor is something you will appreciate .
5 #### Great product ! Arrived quickly and product is just as it was advertised . Very satisfied .
4 #### When I was on Amazon looking for straps for my acoustic guitar , all of them seemed overdone or too simple . That was until I saw this beauty . I 've had this strap for over two weeks and I love it . It 's comfortable and it feels sturdy and secure . The white lightning bolt is what makes this strap shine . While other designs were too simple for me or simply nonexistent , this lightning bolt was just a near perfect fit . I just ca n't give it that fifth star because I have n't been able to experience it 's durability .
5 #### Never used before but with a small roller went on cam cover fine ... id buy again
5 #### Fit my 01 Ram 2500 perfectly . I even used a set of dikes to cut off the extra tabs and little shipping support pieces since I did n't have a dremel . Worked without an issue and looks good !
5 #### This case is beautiful . The soft feel is a plus because it helps with grip on the phone . Looks great on white iphone or a black iphone . It was a perfect fit , no looseness . The cutout on the apple logo on the back is flush dead in the center . The only con that I see is that the screen is n't protected by the case if you were to lay the phone screen face down . Do be aware of that mishap . But overall it is a pretty cheap durable case . My dad has it on his phone now since I upgraded to a iphone 4 . If you do decide to get this case Enjoy it . It will without a doubt look great on your phone . ENJOY ! !
4 #### The cable sold here by the NYC Amazon merchant is the exact same cable ( same length ) as the one that comes with the Bold 9700 at a fraction of the price compared to your nearby electronics & office supplies store .
3 #### bought it to replace old similar phone for bro who does n't want fancy smartphone . It 's a lot lighter and simple to use compared to newer phones .
5 #### I was n't convinced these were the best bulbs until I compared him to what was originally on the car . They are far brighter and it just seems to make the car feel safer .
5 #### Before I found this Velbon , I bought a Manfrotto tripod kit for almost 3x the cost . I wish I had found this tripod first . This Velbon is every bit as smooth and sturdy as the Manfrotto . I mean it is really smooth , both up and down and side - to - side . Bobby T.
5 #### I got this for my grandson who love this mini wood conga . As a conga player this little bad boy is the real deal . No scrimping on the hardware or the construction . This is not a toy , it 's a real drum !
5 #### heavy beast , well built . It 'll outlast the amp that I use it with .
5 #### Unbeliveable ( until you hear them ) quality for the price ! I 'm a musician but not much of an audiophile , tho I 'd wager my hearing is slightly above average . The amount of richness ( esp base ) was surprising - i could n't believe my laptop ( usually very sub - par sound ) and Rio Karma ( as compared to the Sennheiser MX300 earbuds ) could output such quality tones . My brother recommended these ( he has perfect pitch and much better ears than me ) , as he uses these during his commute instead of his Grado SR 125 's which were getting beat up and are n't nearly as comfortable as the Koss PortaPros . Though obviously not anywhere as ' elite ' as Grados or Beyers , I find it impressive that these are an adequate replacement for his Grado 's . Additionally , the tension adjustment is a really nice feature , and the cushioning arrangement works great for people who wear glasses . Additionally , they look really snazzy with the metallic blue accents .
5 #### I was kind of weary about ordering this due to some of the negative reviews , but so far it is perfect ! I 've used this with and without a screen protector ( The Steinheil Crystal ) and there is no difference ; it slides in easily and securely either way . The screen is also fully functional , which is a huge plus . I gave a 5 on comfort ; the only thing that is NOT comfortable is the fact that the phone is huge ( and as a female , I have fairly small arms ) this is obviously no fault of the armband . In fact , the Tune Belt does a fantastic job of making a massive phone as comfortable as possible . As far as protecting the phone from sweat , I ca n't imagine if you 're dripping buckets none will get through . I personally try to stick to exercising in the cooler parts of the day anyway , so it 's not an issue for me . If you 're out at the hottest part of the day and naturally sweaty , I would proceed with caution .
5 #### These are well made and look great too . Fast shipping also
5 #### I bought this compression pedal to give my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that . When playing hammer - ons and pull - offs , sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking , but not when using this pedal . It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound . Works great if used correctly . Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that louder / softer sound . I use this with a Gibson Les Paul , and Washburn Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals . It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion .
5 #### These feel nice in your hands and have a great tension in the handle . Since these are metal , do n't use them with nonstick or enamel cookware . I use these only for handling meat , such as chicken breast , drumsticks , etc . They are especially useful when you try to grab thin strips of bacon ( especially if you 're used to using a bacon press to make bacon very flat ) . The build quality seems up there and I suspect these will last many years . I own three pairs of tongs , and all are Kuhn Rikon . The other tongs are the 11 inch " Kuhn Rikon Silicone Tongs " ( which have the same shape as these ) and the " Kuhn Rikon 12 - Inch Silicone Tongs " ( which have an angled grabbing end . You can search for these on amazon by using what I wrote in quotations as your search . Keep in mind , that although the design is from Europe , these tongs are manufactured in China . I would buy this again and also feel comfortable giving this as a small gift to someone .
3 #### Let 's be clear , this is for ACOUSTIC guitars . It does n't say so on the listing , but it holds much too hard for an electric .
5 #### Great stuff ...... a must have if you have a K&N filter .
3 #### works but take too long to charge thanks to one of the reviews i found out how use it .. no manual included
5 #### 5 years of abuse and they 're still going strong . Ca n't argue with that . After a bunch of disappointments with Monster Cables and other brands , I 've switched over all my daily - use cables over the years to Planet Waves cables , and I 'm pretty happy with the way things are going . Have n't had one go on me yet .
4 #### This is cool and all , but I was a little upset when I found out I could buy it at the dollar store for about half the price .
5 #### These are great sticks but they do n't seem to be lasting as long as they used to
4 #### Helpful tool but you can use a coat hanger just as easily .
5 #### I have two of these in mounted permanently . Mounted one to my electric start backup electric generator and the other is mounted to the battery case of a deep cycle backup battery . Carefree chargers . Recommended .
5 #### This is one of those products that I do n't know anything about . It works great and it did n't cost much . I do n't know what else to say . I doubt you would need to pay more for one of these items .
5 #### It holds my blackberry curve prefectly , even with the protective skin on ! Rotates and stays .
5 #### After a year+ with Sennheiser 's HD 595s and a few days with these , I can tell you confidently that these have improved sound . They are a bit more neutral and more extended , with tighter , stronger bass as well as better defined highs . But I 'm not sure they were worth the money , given that I already had a pretty good set of cans in the HD 595 . They are discernably better ( even w/o burn - in ) but the comparative listening I 've done indicates that the 595s are well within the " same league . " Had I had the good sense to test both before buying either one , I would have spent the extra $ $ on these . The imaging ( location of instruments and voices ) is notably better ( though the 595 is very good ) , and the dynamic range seems to be modestly better ( tighter and stronger bass ) . But since I already own the 595s , I 'm not quite sure about whether to indulge myself by keeping these headphones or sending them back . I 'm darned sure that , if I did n't already own the 595s , I 'd be keeping them happily .
5 #### Awesome Name Brand Strap at a GREAT PRICE . I Received it so fast ! I was excited to take it out of the package , and it did not disappoint me . Ernie Ball Makes Great Straps as well as strings . ALSO I SLIT THE THREADS ABOVE THE ERNIE BALL LOGO AND VOILA ! MADE ME A PICK HOLDER POCKET ! ! ! COOOOOOL ! Did n't have to pay extra for one of those fancy pick - pocket straps .
5 #### I bought this to replace the dying battery in my 2008 BMW R1200RT . Short of a having to cut a few pieces of closed cell foam to take up the space of the smaller battery , installation was a breeze . With 100 more CCA than the OEM battery , it really spins the bike over when cold . All in all , I am very happy with this battery and will see how it does in the long run , but from what others have said , most get really great service from them .
5 #### Good improvement over the generic brand one my second - hand Marantz came with . Very easy to install and comes with a lot of extra hardware to fit a bunch of different tone arms .
5 #### These binoculars are great . Good magnification , nice compact size and includes a carrying case . What more could you ask for in an inexpensive pair of pocket binoculars ? I can easily see distant license plates , they work great at sporting events / large concerts , and I have to assume they 'd be great for bird watching and the like . 10/10
5 #### I have been buying headphones for years now , looking for just the right one . It has been a long journey , but I am finally here . The last pair I owned was a pair of Stax electrostatics that was so uncomfortable I could only wear them for half an hour at a time . ( It does n't matter how good headphones sound if they hurt you . ) The HD 600 is the last headphone I 'll buy . It does exactly what I want with precision , grace and charm , and I can comfortably wear them all day long . Anything above this gets so far past the point of diminishing returns that it would become embarrassing and financially foolish for me to go there . I am running these with a classic Pioneer Elite integrated amp that has a very nice headphone section . The first sign for me of a good set of cans is when I keep taking them off to check if my main speakers are playing . These are like that ... I 'm listening late at night and I think I must be disturbing people because the soundstage is expansive and the sound so sweet and full on these things .
5 #### Nice wiremold . It looks good and does the job by hiding any wires . I have mine in the living room and it looks good .
4 #### Easy on my fingers - have a bright sound that mellows out nicely after a few hours of play .
5 #### Great quality and spot on color match , shipped very fast !
5 #### I purchased this lens a few days ago and have taken many action shots of birds and airplanes already and am very please . I was concerned by some of the reviews complaining about the lens being slow to focus . I did not find this to be a problem , however , it does on occasion decide to run the focus all the way one direction and then come back to the proper point . Some people complained that it randomly decided what to focus on . To those people I say , READ YOUR CAMERA 's MANUAL ! There is an option to select what point in your view your camera 's auto focus will focus on and this is NOT a flaw of the Lens ! When I left my Canon Rebel XS in Full Automatic mode , it decides on the point . Put it in a more manual mode , pick the point you want it to focus on , and it works fine . See page 102 of the Canon EOS manual . Bottom line , if you are stepping up from a point and shoot or do n't want to spend $ 500-$2000 on a lens , this is a great buy .
5 #### Only used this one time so far , but my filter was very dirty and caked up . So far looks like I will get about 2 uses out of this package . For the price , I think that is reasonable .
5 #### Great custom fit for the very odd shaped Wrangler wind shield .
5 #### It is what it is , an inexpensive and compact stand . It wo n't replace a good stand and is n't nearly as safe for the instrument since it does n't cradle the neck , but is handy to store in the back of the amp in case you forget your real stand . Built as good as you can make it to be so light .
2 #### too " hard ' of plastic used , not flexible enough but better than no cover at all . note fill with dielectric grease
5 #### Not much to say about a cable , but it works like you 'd expect . Three feet is short , but just what you need in some situations ( between a router and wireless access point in my case ) .
2 #### The case did not withstand a lovers quarrel . It cracked immediately upon impact to the ground ; does not fully cover the iPhone . No shield protection
5 #### got it , installed it , and working as it should , NETGEAR is an excellent product when you get a working unit .
5 #### I use it as my radio on my motorcycle . Works great for that . I see others complaining about FM reception , but it 's only slightly worse the radio on my car - which is not to say my car has a bad radio ( it 's a 2013 ) , but that given this thing does n't have an antenna , it does an amazing job inspite of that .
1 #### This battery will not hold up in the Rotax Kart . I bought 2 batteries and neither lasted for over 30 minutes . Both failed such that the voltage dropped to " 0 " volts under any kind of load and neither battery would take a charge . This battery is junk for the Rotax application .
5 #### Cost under $ 4.00 shipped and works just as good as HDMI 6'length I paid $ 25.00 at Best Buy . No complaints here . Now I have a 10 ' so I can connect to the TV and still reach my lazyboy .
5 #### Sound quality is very good ; much better than I expected .
5 #### Does exactly what it was designed to do . I have owned one of these Wesbar harnesses before , so I had no worries about getting another one . Would recommend .
5 #### easy to use . conceals wires great . did n't try to paint it . the adhesive it strong and the tubes snap close firmly .
2 #### Thought about giving a 1 , but went up to a 2 because I might have picked the wrong size , wanted to give the benefit of doubt . Got for a Maserati Quattraporte , based off of the description dimensions I thought there would be plenty of room . However , this cover only fit about 3/4 the car , and that is being generous . I kept pulling on one end , then the opposite end would pop off , very frustrating . This is after several attempts to get the cover to secure to something . It was too slippery and kept sliding off onto the ground . I could not get a bite on the car for it to secure to , no mirror pockets or anything to latch on to the car . Is there a shortage on fabric ?
2 #### winder keeps coming unscrewed . Does n't fit tuners very well on Squier strat , keeps coming of while winding . Cutters work well .
3 #### Love the item good to have but went out in one month . ...
5 #### Ca n't beat the price ! works fine on my equipment ( used on commercial and residential ) that use 50:1 ratio . The oil is dark color , making notable if you add oil in your fuel jog or not . Not like other brands that you can barely can notice the difference . Highly recommended .
5 #### Of all my cases this is the one that I have on my phone right now I love , love , love it fits great so pretty and femine
3 #### This could be a 5 star rating but the product is labeled wrong in the description section . This only fits jeeps up to 2003 . I returned it and ordered the correct fit . Sturdy build and good buy if it actually fits .
5 #### I forgot to switch awning to extend and broke my other cord . This one was easy to install and works perfect .
5 #### So many of us have too much free time these days . We spend it re - designing the wheel . Well if you 're an electronics hobbiest , you 'll need some main leads to piggy - back components together . These double alligator leads do the trick . This is a set of 10 - 14 " double ended leads rated to 600V on 20AWG wire . They have small jaw alligator clips pefect for fitting in tight spaces and even hitting individual components on bread board . Not much more I can say about them other than they work and I like them .
5 #### I do n't like ear buds as I 'm constantly having to adjust them . These headphones are great . The sound quality is excellent , and it is probably louder than the badly fitting earbuds that came with my MP3 player . The headband when set in its lowest position is still a bit high for my head , as I keep my hair short . Anyone with more depth of hair will have plenty of adjustment . It 's not enough to put me off them . I recommend them as great value . I 'm ordering more of them to keep around for when I break them or lose them .
2 #### Remained waterproof through shallow dives of about 12 - 15 feet . Picture quality not as good as hoped , grainy . Shutter seemed to trip too easily and lost about half of the pictures to nothingness .
5 #### This radio has worked very well and it just what I needed . Small and easy to mount in my Jeep .
5 #### This is simply the best case money can buy . See one yourself before you buy any other . You will see that the thick rubber material covers the ENTIRE phone through out , not just on the back , and the raised edges along the screen provide a thick cushioniong and depth of protection , should your phone be dropped on this side . ( while still not hindering any typing or screen space ) Some other cases , like ones with " rigid interior skeleton " surrounded by " some rubber " ? That is pointless for the protection of dropping a phone . That rigid skeleton would only be beneficial for protection against slolwly applied even pressure , like if you were to put ur phone in a vice and slowly tighten it . This is not the application of protection you need . You want cushion and spring so that when the phone drops , the case will absorb as much of that velocity as possible , providing the phone a soft landing . That is exactly what this case does , and I have not found one that 's better made .
5 #### bought this map for my office -- to mark the places i visited with pins . i framed the map and used a foam backboard to hold the pins . the frame and backboard were pretty inexpensive and did n't take very long to assemble . the only downside is that the names of the cities are pretty small -- and depending what types of pins you use -- the pin may cover up the city . i have no complaints . glad i bought map .
5 #### Great book for a fraction of the cost of the factory book . I always try to repair my 2007 GTI myself if at all possible because the VW dealer is SO EXPENSIVE ! !
5 #### Cable was delivered promptly , product was as described . Used it to connect a second computer to a router ... connections worked with no problems . Connector ends appear to be sturdy enough that I have no concerns about connecting and disconnecting this cable over time . Considering the price , this is a good value .
5 #### This is a heavy duty strap . I use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar does n't fall . It is a very comfy strap and prolly would n't break if you had a knife to it . It 's the best strap money can buy .
5 #### They 're tiny sponges that hold water and fit the D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Humidifier < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/D - Addario - Acoustic - Guitar - Humidifier / dp / B0002D0COE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Humidifier</a>&nbsp;perfectly . In that regard they do precisely what they are designed to do .
4 #### Very secure , just a little awkward to snap and unsnap .
5 #### Got this for my 2011 VW Jetta Sportswagen .. IT WORK GREAT TO PROTECT AND CLEAN THE SYNTHETIC LEATHER ... GOOD PRICR COMPARES TO LOCAL shops ...
5 #### I 've had several , this is the best . Good seller , great device , easy to set up and use .
5 #### Awsome sound with outstanding playability . I did not know that quality strings could make such a difference in how a guitar sounds .
1 #### i ordered this battery and waited several weeks before i was brave enough to install it ..... i watched the video many times and decided i was ready ..... after i was done it came on but it started restarting over and over ... battery would say 20 % then 80 % just crazy stuff .... i charged it for 12 hours from 2 % and it said 67 % so i gathered it was a defective battery after i backed up my phone and restored it and it still did the same thing ... i went back to my very weak original battery and its fine again .... this battery is just that ... CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!also it keep going off so much it took hours to catch it stay on long enough to sync with itunes ..... you can use your own judgement
4 #### The item is smaller than expected . but it is what I wanted . This is one ocasion that the pic is deceiving . If you are looking for one I would get it again . The price was right .
5 #### Some of the best feeling strings out there . These strings also bring out a good sound on the guitar too .
3 #### These are great for walking , or other low - impact activities . However , they were really not about to stay put on my head when I was running at the gym . I spent much of that workout fiddling with them before I finally gave up . Great sound quality and easy to use though ; I 'll keep them for use around the house or at the office :)
5 #### New desk allowed better placement of printer , but it was farther from computer . This long cable allowed the connection to be completed but still hiding the cable behind things . Works as advertised . 16 feet of length has NO degradation of service .
5 #### These headphones lasted about 6 years before finally breaking down . It was an excellent purchase . Good sound quality and were comfortable . Good for a casual listener , not so good for an audiophile .
5 #### Like all Logitech products it 's first class , works well and it 's well made . I wanted to get a ball mouse for my XP pro 64 operating system , the drivers are not 64 bit just yet but the generic drivers in XP pro 64 run it just fine . I also have a Logitech S510 wireless keyboard and I was hoping that the ball mouse could be sustituted for the cordless mouse that came with it . It can not , the S510 keyboard / mouse receiver will not accept the ball mouse signal , so I have two receivers in order to use the ball mouse . That 's not the best situation but still ok with me .
5 #### I buy Elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now . They last the longest and hold the brightest and clearest tone of any string I 've ever used . The nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference . They take several months to wear out ( as opposed to the weeks other major brands last ) . They may cost a bit more than the competition , but if you try them and love them as much as I do , you 'll never use anything else again .
3 #### Very rich sound for the price . Have owned this product for several years and the sound is spot on but the earpads flaked badly and fall off repeatedly which is a pain in the ass to deal with . See many similar complaints .
5 #### I got my Iphone 4 Bumper case through the Iphone 4 Free Case Program . This is a great product . It is not a simple band , but has buttons on it which cover the actual iphone buttons , and make them easier to press . All holes are also perfectly alligned , and this case actually keeps the look of the iPhone . It would have been better though if it came with screen protectors , but still , it is great .
5 #### No problems with this product ... I recommend it because in my experience works good and the product was completly new .
5 #### Seems to be made of good quality , 3 m auto tape is holding strong . My sunroof is much quieter with this on . 2002 4runner
2 #### The keyboard itself is great . Keys are nice to type on . Love the shortcut keys . Backlight is great for typing in the dark . But the major problem is that the cutout for the camera and flash causes the flash to create a haze in all photos you take with the flash on . If that did n't happen then I would 've kept it . Sending it back to Amazon now .
5 #### Very VERY snug fit , but you squeeze that sucker in there and its not going anywhere .. cool case
5 #### The cable is indeed an OEM data cable . There is no fancy packaging but it just works .
5 #### I mostly use my capo for " Drop D " tuning , and they 're the best . They say I need seven more words .
5 #### Easiest application of these things yet . Always buy multi - pacs in case of mistakes . First attempt was piece of cake . And for a tad over 3 bucks ( w / shipping ) how can you go wrong ?
5 #### They r a good price and it works a win win situation . People have no problem hearing me or I them .
1 #### my phone fell on a soft surface and this little gadget broke my screen even though my phone was in a case and had a glass protector ...
5 #### It is hard to find a video cleaner . This was cheap and now I can watch my VHS movies again . The only thing is that I wish that the included wet solution was bigger .
5 #### This is a great , cheap product that protects the phone well without adding bulk . I have dropped my phone quite a few times over these last 5 months and this product seems to save the day a lot . Very happy with my purchase
5 #### Love these , Light weight , excellant high , mid and low ouput . good frequency response . No fatigue . Never realized quality of the Sony MDR - V6 until you buy them . Oh ! these are refurbished a steal ! ! Look new , sound super ! ! Happy , Happy customer
5 #### I used this with a Tricam ACC-1F Hitch Mounted Aluminum Cargo Carrier , First I mounted it per the instructions and the cargo carrier would still pivot left and right with almost no effort . I found I had to actually reverse the bottom plate so that the lip hooked over the lip of the Curt Hitch receiver . Takes a good bit of effort now to make it pivot . Seems to be good quality parts - recommend .
5 #### There is nothing else to say about this mic . So I will only add that it arrived flawless and safe .
4 #### I was looking for a pair of headphones that had great sound quality and that did n't cut out all ambient noise . These delivered in all aspects and won me over with their vintage appeal . The sound is bright , crisp , undistorted and they are also very comfortable while wearing eyeglasses . I was tempted by Vintage cans like the Sennheiser HD414s but the used prices are a little hard to justify when compared to the Koss PortaPros . The HD414s also need a powerful amp for them to shine and I 'm just plugging into my Mac and iPod most of the time . The Koss PortaPros are the ultimate in retro chic and for the price you 'd be hard - pressed to find another set that rivals their sound quality and design .
5 #### Love this stuff , definitely use this if you 're a hardcore guitar player .
1 #### I purchased the Maxell VP-100 from Amazon and it arrived promptly . However it DID NOT WORK at all . I placed it into my VCR and ... nothing ! ! ! It will not operate in play , FF or rewind . It appeared to be jammed . So I figured I just got a defective one . I used Amazon 's return service ( which was great and very easy to use ! ) to get a replacement . Unfortunately , the replacement did not work either . It is jammed just like the first one . This ia a awful product and I am suprised that it carries the Maxell name . Two strikes and you are out , this product is NOT RECOMMENDED at all ! I found it strange that the label on the VHS cassette is a very generic looking black and white . I will return it again , but this time I will try another brand ! NOT RECOMMENDED at all ! UPDATE : I just found out I can no longer return this second defective product unless I pay shipping because my window ( one month ? ) has expired . I do n't use my VCR much so I let this sit for a while . It 's not worth the cost to ship it back , so it 's going in the trash .
5 #### Works fine ... no assembly instructions with it so takes a few minutes to figure out how to assemble . Seems very sturdy and I 've been using it alot
4 #### This is a wonderful organizer for all the rechargable items in your life . I have 2 phones , bluetooth headset , my digital camera , & my handheld organizer in my organizer ; always ready to go and in one spot so I do n't have to remember which room they 're charging in . The brown faux leather looks really nice and blends in with my furniture so it 's not an eyesore .
5 #### These are amazing I can berly tell they are on my iPhone they are invisible and great for the price
5 #### Never mind that I used a Belkin RJ45F / RJ45F Straight Cat5 Rated Modular Coupler . I have several short cables and this adds flexibility and range . Used these couplers for years .
1 #### This is a rugged case , but you will not be able to sync / charge using a docking stand . The screen cover is designed poorly and trapped air makes it difficult to see the icons . There is another popular case that is just as strong and will allow you to dock eaasy . The belt clip will not hold the iPhone . You should be aware that the phone could fall out without your knowledge if you are in a noisy area or in my case a grassy area with a light wind . I had no idea the phone fell until I turned around and walked back the way I came .
5 #### Perfect to protect your hard wood floors . The sticky material does an excellent job and keeps them in place . Definitely recommend these things .
5 #### Great strings if you like them light . Improves your speed across the fret board and makes that F bar chord feel like you 're barely touching the strings . And yes , you can bend these pretty easy , too . Just remember that lighter strings means less sustain and less dynamic range . As for the XL brand , these strings are real steel , rarely break , and have a very smooth , silky finish and feel . Excellent tone as well .
5 #### Excellent Bought these or my 11 year old granddaughter : I remember how frustrating it was in School Band Class to split or break a Reed and not have a replacement Reed availableis why i got her a box of Strength 1 1/2 Reeds also a box of Strength 2 ReedsShould last her thru the 6th grade .
5 #### My husband loves this case and will not take it off of his phone even when he answer his phone calls
5 #### Beautiful , glossy , fits perfect , worth every penny . Made my iphone look new :) I just wish they were available in multiple colors .
5 #### I got mine a couple of days ago , great sound across the spectum , no feedback that I could create with my little amp . I would definatly recomend this pick - up
5 #### Strings are so subjective and perform so differently depending on the instrument , I have a hard time reviewing them . I have them on an older MIM P bass and am quickly falling in love with them . I tried GHS flats on this bass previously- about all I can say is meh ( too rough - they feel more like half rounds , just not the right tone on this particular instrument ) . I 've got another P bass ( fretless ) with Labella Jamerson 's on it ( which are still my favorite flats ) , but these are a close second . Add to that they 're half the price of the Labella 's , and we 've got an easy winner . They 're silky smooth , and probably more versatile than the Labella 's as there 's plenty of top end for a wide variety of styles and music . My tone knob has never been more useful !
5 #### I used it on a small machine screw for my turn signal switch . Holds great ! I do n't have to worry about snapping the screw when i remove it again . Could not find it in any stores . Went to amazon and found it Thanks !
5 #### This is my second purchase of this lock . The original was part of the pop - up I sold . It was perfect and worked solidly . This one looks exactly the same and I know will work flawlessly as well .
5 #### I use these for professional cable installs and they 're the kind of quality I was hoping for . I 'll be buying more .
5 #### This is some really good basic film . The colors are good and the price is nice too . I use these a lot because they are affordable and the results always come out pretty good .
5 #### Best sound ever for my videos and Google+ hangouts . No background noise . Very high quality . Exceeded my expectations dramatically . Excellent product .
5 #### I got tired of paying for the dealer or manufacturer 's over pricing on my ATV oil filter so I did some cross referencing and found this one for my Arctic Cat ATV . This Fram does n't have the capacity ( about a third smaller ) but it fits perfectly and using Fram so many years , I very much trust the performance I 'll get out of it and it 's practically half the dealer cost . I 'm sure Fram has a bigger capacity that 'll fit but I 'm not that concerned as I can change these nearly twice for one of the others . But again , I would n't say this is a worthy trade - off unless I trusted Fram as I do .
5 #### I put this pedal between a vintage Rhodes electric piano and my current practice amp . The tremolo effect is nice and can be adjusted to give the Rhodes a bit more " life " in its sound . However , after what seemed like a short time , I noticed that I had a lot of amplifier hiss with the pedal turned off and the output volume had gotten really low . The battery was almost used up by this point . The good news is that after I connected a 9 V power supply to the pedal , the hiss went away and it was back to working really well with good output volume . A power pack is pretty much mandatory with this pedal . A 9 V battery has way too short a lifetime to be useful . Apart from that , I 'm really pleased with the sound for such an inexpensive pedal .
5 #### If you want to get that 1,000,000 mile guarantee out of your K&N filter you need this kit .
5 #### This is my first time to use these strings . I was interested in them because I play my acoustic sporadically so my strings do n't wear out , so much as they age out . I usually have to change them for the sake of tone , not because of physical wear or stretch . As such , the idea of a coated string was appealling . So far , I 'm happy with them . The tone was nice and bright , and has been consistent over the few months I 've had them on . As a bonus , you do n't seem to get that metallic smell on your fingers that some strings leave .
5 #### I needed a few small cases to store various items - radios , batteries , and such . I found both these and the Pelican Micro cases . While Pelican is the gold standard for the larger cases , only the OtterBox cases have the quality I expected in this size . The plastic seems to be more resistant to scratching and cracking , the bottom and top of the case actually ' seal ' together , and the top and bottom are both padded to protect the contents from shock , whereas the pelican case only has rubber padding on the bottom half . The hinge opens to slightly over 180 degrees , but it is loose , so where you can open the Pelican lid half way and it will stay , the lid on this case will fall to either full open or full closed . The latches are a little tighter than the pelican case , especially to open , which is a good thing . The protrusions on the top and bottom do not stack . The lanyard , while it has n't broken yet , seems like the first part that will fail . All in all , this seems to be a rugged storage and organizational tool .
5 #### Works great easy to set up and easy to read
2 #### I searched for a data cable based on my phone model ( LG900 G ) and this is the cable that was suggested . Works fine as a charging cable but does n't work as a data cable . I 'm sure it might work on other listed models just fine , but if you have the LG900 G it probably wo n't work .
1 #### Very flimsy , the white cover is all faded and come part on surface ... I wanted a RFEAL one and could n't get one just these cheap knock offs . NOT worth the money !
5 #### Need more space for my Galaxy S4 so this has been great for the month I 've had it . No issues so far , and lots of quick access space .
1 #### I though this was the case with the molded sides , but this has soft sides . Saxophones are too delicate to put in a case with flexible sides . I did n't realize it until too late to return and do n't want to sell it and contribute to the detriment of someone else 's horn . Very disappointed with description of this case . Stuck with two underwhelming soft cases and keeping MY horn it its original box .
5 #### After having replaced my 250 3 times at the verizon store I asked to be given the 250V instead of a 4th 250 , they did and so far so good , I think Jabra knew the 250 had some defects , each 250 i had died ( stopped pairing ) in about 2 months , the 250V seems to have no problems and works much better with my Motorola V710 . The fit is great , and the sound is good , could use better noise cancellation , but oh well , maybe in a future model . But overall , I like the 250V. I recommend it to anyone . Just roll your windows up if your driving , or you wo n't be heard by the other end of your call .
4 #### Very easy to install . Just follow the Video . Lets in a nice breeze while keeping the rain out . * * * * Make sure you push it all the way up in the window track . If not it could damage your internal window controls . I did n't and had to spend $ 60 on a new window kit($380 at Ford dealership ) . Not the products fault , but my own so no deduction in points .
5 #### It is very easy to use ! My drum tuning has never been this easy ... I can even tune my drums with all the noise around , guaranteed to get the right tune everytime ! Highly recommended !
4 #### This was a simple , inexpensive way to increase internet connectivity for a smart TV and gaming system . We only had one ethernet connection and the location was such that the TV 's internal wifi connection was just way too slow . Bought this , plugged - in the cables and that was it- much quicker video streaming and the ability to have two devices connected to our one ethernet outlet .
5 #### Fits like a glove on the Class C 2002 Dynamax Carri - go Ford E450 . Makes it seem more roomy inside due to not having to hang an interior curtain . Seems to keep it cooler inside and will keep the sun from fading the interior . Great investment - I Love it .
5 #### After trying the d'addario uncoated strings of the same gauge , I remember why I switched to elixirs many years ago . These are much more consistent in tone and the balance and overall feel is perfect . I play a Taylor 614ce and I restring with elixirs about once a month to keep my sound really pristine .
1 #### After a couple of months with this headset I have to give it a bad review . It does not perform well with my iPhone and often callers say my speech sounds all warbled and scratchy . Further , it 's uncomfortable to wear and feels heavy behind my ear . I also can not wear my sunglasses with it . I get much better mic quality either holding my iPhone up to my ear without a headset , or using the wired one that came with it . I regret my purchase of this Plantronics .
5 #### The buds have a very good sound . they have a decent range . They are very comfortable to wear . the cord on the buds could be a little longer but other than that they are good . They are very light , so you reall do n't feel them around your neck . if they could play the ringtones i have set for my contacts they would be awesome .
5 #### Do not listen to other reviewers , screws that this came with are concrete only , there are no wood or dry wall screws . You will ! ! ! ! need a stud finder ! ! ! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate , so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud . Sturdy , good looking . There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need .
2 #### This case is a very simple sleeve - simply a vinyl pocket to slip your Curve into . The big feature is that it has a magnet in it so that when you slip your Curve into the pocket , it locks the keys so that you can not accidentally call anyone . Not sure why anyone would want to buy this item - it is a barely functional holder of the blackberry , and has no belt loops or any features that one would expect from phone holder . Besides , this comes with most of the Curves . While it works , there is no real reason to buy this item . Save your money for a real holster .
5 #### I bought this mic to record EVERYTHING , drums , guitars , bass , and vocals . So far with guitar and drums it ca n't be beat ! For the price this mic sounds outstanding . So for anyone who was unsure of its ability to pic up all the highs , lows , and mids of a drum set it does just fine !
5 #### I use and reuse these sponges but wanted a couple extra just in case . I need to rinse them in the dishwasher every couple of weeks to keep them clean , or I also rinse them out with antibacterial soap . When I first started using them I noticed a smell from my guitar after about two weeks - it was the sponge smelling foul . I cleaned it and no more problem . I have also tried dipping them in distilled water with a small amount of scent , like Fa - breeze , or a lavender scent . It makes the guitar and case smell nice .
5 #### Got ta have it if you beat the hell out of you bass drum , sounds great ..
4 #### short life but I play games and rarely shut it off so some of it is my fault ...
5 #### The Canon Angle Finder C was a life ( or more accurately a back ) saver for me . I 've used it for astrophotography so far and whereas before where I would have to lie on the ground and twist into a human pretzel to see through the viewfinder I can now get a clear view in relative comfort and greater dignity . The viewfinder has two magnification settings , the greater magnification is helpful for focusing . The image through the angle finder is crystal clear . The angle finder also pivots so you can move it to a more comfortable position ( it is still 45 degrees but it moves perpendicular to the lens ) . The build quality is top notch . It comes with a storage pouch . I use it with an EOS 40D.
5 #### Great price fast shipping fits my phone great love the belt clip
4 #### A fun size amp with a nice small room sound and perfect if one is lacking in space to practice . It 's one of the Amps best feature ; its ' Fun size . It takes little to no space at all and if it 's late just plug in a pair of headphones and play . The only critique is the " clean " vs " overdrive " which is considerably louder , ( as I know it should ) , I just wish the clean had as much volume and power . It is n't loaded with a whole lot of features just straight forward plug in guitar and play . It really is a nice practice Amp and the Price is right on this Amp .
5 #### I got this on the road after I left my other headset at home . This is very comfortable compared to the cheaper model I had been using , and very solid on your head . The microphone is very good quality . Definitely recommend this for anybody needing a headset mic .
5 #### I 'm not going to mention names , but I have ordered five different cases for my iPhone 4 and they were all junk compared to this one . What a great case and very easy to install . Also came with two screen protectors that are better than the $ 18 for three I bought at Best Buy . I do n't often write reviews , but this case is so nice and I went through so much junk to find it I just had to write a review . Save time and money and just buy this case , you wo n't be disappointed . Phil in WI
5 #### Well made and sturdy . Just what I was looking for in an assist handle .
5 #### Really basic , but great price and a year later it is still perfect . It protects the phone and that is all I really care about .
5 #### Always the Best set of strings for all of my electric guitars . Ca n't get any better than this .
3 #### I initially posted a review about this product when I received it . It has been four months since then . The screen protector does protect my phone from scratches and dirt . It was $ 8 . I love that . On the other hand , the smudges show on the cheap material and i find that quite annoying . I ca n't decide if I should remove the screen protector . I would not suggest this to a friend . Spend your money on something that is actually worth it !
5 #### Worked like a charm once I got the mounting brackets off the motor . Spray everything with liquid wrench or the like for several days before you plan to start work and a 2 jaw gear puller and a butane micro torch come in handy . Plan on half a day or so to do the job with bleeding the system and all . Keep in mind , this is a good time to flush the old fluid out of the lines and so you may want to order 2 or 3 qts . of seastar fluid at the same time . Yes it 's more expensive than transmission fluid but it 's better for your system and the seastar stuff wo n't void your warranty
5 #### Good product and a great rate ! I love the sillcon case better then rubber , plug and i do recommend it to my friends !
5 #### When I added two new servers to my server rack , I was faced with the choice of adding a new fixed capacity UPS for the new servers or replace my older inadequate UPS system with something more capable and expandable . I purchased the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Tripp - Lite - APS750 - 750W-12V - DC - to - AC - Inverter - with - Automatic - Line - to - Battery-20 - Amp - Charger / dp / B0007PGAG6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Tripp Lite APS750 750W 12V DC to AC Inverter with Automatic Line - to - Battery 20 - Amp Charger</a>&nbsp;back in 2010 for use in my camper and have been very pleased with its quality and performance so I decided to purchase it 's bigger cousin , the APS2012 2000W inverter for my server room . Along with the APS2012 2000W , I purchased two&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Optima - Batteries-8052 - 161 - D31M - BlueTop - Dual - Purpose - Battery / dp / B00099DW6G / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Optima Batteries 8052 - 161 D31 M BlueTop Dual Purpose Battery</a > s to string in parallel .

FBL-300 300 Amp Fuse Class T with Block</a>&nbsp;in - line fuse , I now have the perfect expandable UPS system . In testing , I found the above combination of two batteries in parallel with the APS2012 2000W , I can power my four servers , routers , switches , and digital phone system for up to 2 and a half to three hours in a power failure . To increase the run time , I need only to add additional batteries . For now , this configuration works very well for my needs .
5 #### These work good . Have bought another one to put on a new bass . I initially put them on with some thin double stick tape to make sure it 's where I want them .
5 #### This is one of the most sound investments I 've ever made . A few times since I 've had the power pack it has saved me from being without a phone . It charges electronic devices ( my new iPhone 5 in particular ) about twice the speed of a normal charger . It 's lightweight and so small it fits into a cup holder , purse , pocket , glove box , almost anywhere you can think of . Because it 's USB you can charge any cell phone and many other electronics . It charges my new iPhone from empty to full 2 + times before needing its own recharge . One of the things I really love about this is I can have it at home for whenever a need a super - fast charge or it 's affordable to even have a second so I can just leave it in my glove box for an emergency . When I bought this two of the features I did n't know it had was a laser pointer , great for teaching and a super - bright and flashlight , again great for that emergency . The charger itself is super easy to re - charge , you can charge it via an electrical outlet and you can also charge it using your computer 's USB . Looks like I have most of my Christmas shopping done just buying a few more of these .
2 #### We got these for the kids to take to camp . The pictures turned out blurry and grainy . Not worth it , especially now that digital cameras are so available .
5 #### I love it ! The looks and feel is awesome , and the price is right too . I will recommend this product to all my friends .
3 #### This model Bluetooth headset is ok with clear sound . I prefer the model 510 as it is a bit more comfortable .
5 #### Comments have said that it is loud . On high it does make some noise but I can still sleep with it on . If you are looking for a descent fan at this price BUY it . Turn it to medium speed and it is pretty good . I run two 6 volt batteries in our fifth wheel and the battery draw is virtually nil . I feel it was worth the investment . The unit is solid and it will move some air .
5 #### Great bottle to have in your trunk . Use it for those times when you just get a car wash and you park in a garage for a few days and magically through time and space a bird dropping get on your car . Sprayed a few times and wiped off with a micro fiber cloth . Looks great .
5 #### I really like this tool for my guitar . I travel a lot , and it helps while toning and clipping strings
3 #### It took forever to receive these pens . I actually forgot I had ordered them because it took more than a month to recieve them . Great price but hope you do n't need the product soon !
5 #### I purchased this , so I could wire it into the original lines and add more power options to my car . My stock assembly stayed in place and continued to work , but what I did was tap the wires into the original so I could add a USB car charger to my car hidden away behind the dash . I then ran an iPod cable underneath my radio so my iPhone would charge seamlessly in my car . It worked perfectly and the price was wonderful .
1 #### The phone ca n't charge and the Sims card do n't work
4 #### This case is not an Epiphone LP fake cheap case . Although it is made in China , it is exactly the case that you would buy or with your Epiphone LP guitar at any retail guitar store , at a price of $ 99 and up ! Do n't get me wrong , there were a couple of small rubs on the bottom of the case , but this will also most likely happen the first couple of times I transport my guitar in the car . For the lower Amazon price , you ca n't go wrong ! I give it four stars due to not being perfect , plus there should be more than one key as others have also stated . Most likely I will never lock the case . If someone wants it , most likely they will take case and all .
5 #### Works as expected just wish it had a 6 foot cord .
2 #### I did my research and understand other brands that use silicon are bad etc . etc ..... Lexol is suppose to be all natural , but I wo n't use this stuff again . I used it on a pair of cowboy boots and despite the label saying that it 's a ' Non - Darkening Formula ' it did darken them substantially ... I also tried it on my Dainese motorcycle jacket and it left it feeling tacky and sticky ... glad I stopped there , I 'm sure I would have been more annoyed if I used it on my car seats .... I wo n't be using this product again . ... going to try Mother 's Reflections one - step leather cleaner / conditioner .... I'll update later ....
5 #### Great product as advertised an original OEM part . Works great . I used this on both my cars and have not had any issued with it . Will recommend this .
4 #### Works great . But mine came with only a Japanese language manual ; no English . But you can download the English manual online .
5 #### If you buy this product and use it you will buy nothing else . It works great and does n't leave a greasy grimy film .
5 #### I 've used a few of these for GPS ' and ECU Tuners , and they work great ! You ca n't find a slimmer mounting solution then this . It gives you the choice to use VHB tape to mount to your device and then either VHB or a vent mount to use on your vehicle . Gives you enough for two applications , in case you move the device to multiple vehicles . It 's strong , I 've never had the adhesive try to come off on it 's own or shift ( been about a year since my first use ) . I was able to remove one of them from my dashboard and it came up fine - at least no lasting residue or noticeable mark ( use fish line to separate , then something like goo - gone to clean up ) . All in all for the price and quality you really ca n't beat it .
5 #### I have 2 cordless TrackMan Wheels & 2 corded versions . I ca n't stand to use a computer that is not eqiped with one . It makes so much more sense to to simply use my thumb to navigate rather than having to keep picking up the mouse and moving it to get to whereever it is you are trying to go and ran out of mousepad before you could get there . The TrackMan is very sensible and reliable . Why they do n't quit making mice and make more of these is beyond me . The people who do n't like trackballs have just never really used a trackball . They must be same people that have made American cars cushy and buy iPods .
4 #### Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well , no issues . Would purchase again .
4 #### Very nice , smooth , no sharp edges , not much bigger than the picks it 's holding ( it holds about 10 of my favorite thin Mel Bay picks ) ... the only issue is , the spring clip that pushes the picks to the top , is a little too strong , and was warping my thin picks , but I just put one very stiff pick at the bottom of the pile , and it 's fine . Addendum : After a few years , I needed some more of these ... the new ones are exactly the same , except they 've redesigned the shape of the spring , and I no longer need to protect the picks on the bottom of the pile from warping . Addendum 2 : Lost one , gave a few away , bottom line is I needed more , so I just went to the product description and added half a dozen to my cart . The latest batch are not the new design that I mentioned above , they are the old ones that warp my thin picks . I wo n't bad mouth the vendor who sent me the old style , but I will say the new design in my previous order where " Sold by : Brook Mays " ... it matters who you order from .
5 #### Fit my 2004 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer 5.4 L perfectly .
5 #### If you are a serious drummer , you have to have these on your bass drum ! ! Period ! They not only provide more of a bass " thump " but they also preserve your bass drum head . A MUST have !
5 #### Fits my Ibanez bass perfectly . I like the way it folds up so I can put it in my case . Feels very sturdy . Would definitely recommend it .
3 #### This little charger is portable and functional . It works when you need it . I 'm not sure how sturdy it will be for long term use but great to throw in your pocket when you 're out for the day without access to a wall charger .
4 #### Works , but the way it 's designed , it 's hard to get the tv perfectly level . Bugged me too bad so we replaced with much smaller tv and it works fine
5 #### I purchased my Blackbeery 2 weeks ago and it was very obvious that I needed a better case than what came with it . I researched many different cases and decided that this was the ticket . It arrived promptly and I immediately put it to use . The first thing that I noticed was how rugged it was . The entire set up is worthy of the extra money spend . I have piece of mind knowing that my Blackberry is well protected and it is fully functional with this case . Excellent product .
5 #### unbelievable sonic quality , never thought a headphone could sound so good .
5 #### Nice construction . Not compatible with my iPad 3 like advertised . The iPhone side of connector broke on my last cable after 1 year of almost daily use . This should last another year before I get iPhone 5 .
3 #### These things are very cheap . As in , " look at them wrong and they are likely to break " cheap . But , they do what they are supposed to , and I 'm not afraid of losing one . I got 3 for $ 0.89 and I would n't have paid more .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Mogami Cables and connectors . I use my Mogami cables for patching between wireless receivers and my mixing board . " 0 " failure rate with moderate to heavy use .
5 #### ... and still going strong and sounding great . Must be the ultimate bargain in headphones .
4 #### So far it has worked just like the charger that came with my galaxy s4 . I ordered some aftermarket wire which tore , so spend the extra dollar and go with OEM
5 #### I use this on a regular bases . I find that it really helps in keeping strings in great shape for along time . This is a must have for someone with a guitar collection and does not want to change strings all the time .
3 #### Nothing to write home to mom about here . you get what you pay for . you basic set of chinese made touch screen stylus pens . they did n't work great , but did n't work bad either .
4 #### Have had this unit for about 3 years . no problems .
2 #### Cheap plastic with a mirror finish . Doubt it will last out the season .
5 #### Have an 86 MIK strat and this was a big improvement .
5 #### The beautifully amber Gibson switch cover helps me to look like I know what I am doing , why are you read a review for this thing ? Theft break fro the genius Gibson case every once in a while so just do n't go back to cream .
1 #### I had a Boss NS-2 and it works much better then M135 . I use strat with CS-3 and overdrive . The NS-2 totally cut out the hiss and noise . But this only cut out a little hiss , even I turned everything to the top .
2 #### Better off buying an authentic charger . Packaging was great . Temporary fix , but best to spend a little more for better quality .
3 #### " The FastWipe may leave fine scratches on the surface of the disc . This will not affect the performance of the disc " ( statement on the back of FastWipe packaging ) . I use these for DVD rentals . For CD cleaning , I use Phoenix and microfiber cloths/100 % cotton handkerchiefs . Any CD / DVD - care product that tells you not to wipe in a circular pattern is a suspect product , in my opinion . If the product does not in any way mar the surface of the disc , it should n't matter how you wipe . The reason you 're supposed to wipe a CD / DVD from center to edge in a straight line is that , should you create a scratch , the CD / DVD laser has little trouble correcting for a single blip . CD / DVD lasers , like the cartridge needle of a turntable , read discs in a circular pattern , but from inside out ( unlike the needle of a cartridge , which reads from the outer edge of a record toward the center ) . If you wipe in a circular pattern and you create a scratch , the laser may not be able to correct for the extended misreading the scratch could create .
5 #### These are solid and bright enough . Well worth the price . I plan on buying more for my other jeeps . Just remember to use a relay for the power and the switch to trigger the relay .
5 #### I keep a lot of stuff in here . Nicely made and holds everything I need . Canon 60D , 2 lens , 2 GoPros , Flash , Hoods , etc .
5 #### Upton recommends the Dampit . I 'll take their word for it . I ordered and received the Dampit brand - no problems with a substitute humidifier . I got what I ordered . LISTEN : Test this out before you go sticking it in your bass ( or any other stringed instrument ) . Find out just how much water will leak out if you do n't properly wring out the humidifier . I tested it and was surprised that it started dripping after a few minutes . My fault . I had n't wrung it out enough . Check out the Upton YouTube video on what happens if your humidifier leaks into the bass .
5 #### I love the color coding this protector has . I should have bought this power protector much sooner . I highly recommend it . AA++
1 #### the 1/4 jack plug is a bit narrow . I purchased two of these to connect my studio monitors to my mixer .. I have a large range of 1/4 cables and have never had a problem but the diameter of the 1/4 plug on these cables is simply to small .... they are not a tight fit into the socket and the sound can cut in / out . of course .. i had already thrown away the packaging ........... sigh
2 #### These are of china - quality and are thin with a tip that requires pressure . That I do not like and do n't want to press on my iPad so rarely use them . Work ok on phone as they have small head .
5 #### Top quality cable with Blackberry logo . Structurally sound cables and good quality . I bought 4 and have n't had any problems with them .
3 #### Definitely not a high end tool . But it does work .
5 #### I bought this to go with the new Rebel I bought . EXCELLENT lens , makes the camera look and feel and best of all , take photos like a much higher - end camera . Highly recommend !
4 #### Looks good and easy to attached to bango without scratching it as many straps may do .
3 #### It has trouble tuning in stations without static . It also is top heavy and does not stand up well .
2 #### Its a great fit for the ear , but it does not last long , I had a lot of complaints , people would ask me to take it off so they could here me , it also picked up a lot of back ground noise .
4 #### For really works like a mirror .. Nice , perfect for some one how need a mirror .
5 #### easy set up and great to have hard wire ports for more items that need to be hooked up to router
5 #### Found it on amazon at a great price . blew the local parts dealers away for the same product . Fit perfectly .
4 #### I purchased this because I had a good experience with its predecessor ( the 655 ) but I hated wearing an earpiece while in the car . The Discovery 665 has a wonderful car charger / holder that allows you to dock the headset conveniently in the charger until a call arrives - at that point you simply pull the 665 out of the charger and it connects the call as you are swiftly inserting the headset into your ear . It also seems to perform better in screening out wind noise than the 655 . After the call is ended just hang up by removing the 665 from your ear and inserting it into the car charger / holder . This is a big improvement over the 655 and suits my purposes ( not wearing a headset until a call arrives ) very well .
5 #### Well they work ! Easy to put on . Might not fit some ends that are not rounded . ( to bulky to slide in )
5 #### I have several different bags BUT this is the best one yet . I now have four bags for each of my helmets and use them to rotate between winter and summer helmets .Easy to use and zippers are fast and non - stick . You never have to worry about scratchs on helmet surface with the extra thick fleece padding . Great item .
1 #### These are not made to be used everyday with a phone that gets lots of use . It will work for a while then once the wire gets bent it will split .
4 #### This case is the most colorful cases i purchased and looks great on the iphone - the feel is not sticky either so it slips in the purse phone holder easily .
5 #### I was looking for a good capo that will last . This one had good ratings so I had high hopes . I wanted to make sure it worked with my acoustic because the other one I bought prior to this was n't very strong so some of the strings would buzz . This one clamps hard and works all along the neck on my acoustic . Very happy with it . Been using it regularly for about 7 months . No complaints .
5 #### I highly recommend buying this item . I went threw several expensive items from the sprint store 1 item had a 1 year warrenty that was the USB cord and when I brought it to them they said no cause it had physical damage which was the end piece that came off they said from pullin on it well you have to pull on it to get it out of the phone dumbasses . ANYWAYS sorry as I was saying I ordered these 3 items for next to nothing and they all have a tighter fit then sprint crap which stops them from falling out of the phone and all work great . IT 'S A BUY BUY BUY .
5 #### I have a few other Levys straps and the material differs . My best strap is a Levy and it has leather padding as well . This strap does not have this . It is vinyl and feels much like a duffel bag strap to the touch . Zoom in on the pic and you will get an idea of the texture . That said I bought this strap fully aware of this so I am rating it in context . What I really wanted was a strap that matches my lovely Kiesel(Carvin ) CS3 I had option 50'd in a two tone blue and this strap is a nice compliment to that . It 's quite attractive with its mouse blue uniform with gold trim . I love the selection of straps Levys has and they are all good quality and surprisingly comfortable even in styles such as this .
5 #### Really easy to apply . Worked the first time I hooked it up .
5 #### This is exactly what I needed . It was easy to mount and supports my 40 inch TV ( 26 lbs ) without any issue . I have n't tested the extension brackets , but the rest of the device is very solid . I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight , and it 's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly ( you 'll need a few tools ) . If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot , this might not be the best choice , but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then . My favorite part is the small base . I did n't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV , and this met my needs without eating all my money . Keep in mind that you 'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device . I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws . Speaking of which , I 've mounted two TVs on this , and the box included screws which fit both ( in addition to many more ) . However , you may need a few more washers .
5 #### Really good strings . I bought two sets for my twin sons . The cellos sound better than ever . Loud and warm is the best way to describe it . Much better than the D'Addario Prelude strings they had earlier . Both of the boys agreed that these are easier on the fingers and they can play faster . The strings are very responsive . Two thumbs up !
5 #### I have had a variety of Sony Headphones ( and others over the years - Sennheiser , Nady , Panasonic , Pioneer , etc . ) including the MDR V-700 , V-300 , V-7506 and others . These MDR - V900 Monitors though are the best ! I use them for monitoring music , movies , and most importantly , I use them when playing my Bass Guitar at church . They have a great " boot'en " bottom - end as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproduction ... they simply kick ! I paid much more for them than that advertized on Amazon right now and I am considering buying other pairs for my drummer , sound technician , and guitarist for our church group . My opinion is you ca n't go wrong with these babies !
5 #### I am very satisfied with my purchase , the headphones was all that I expected it to be , keep up the good work .
4 #### Four stars only because by ordering from Amazon , it came slightly bowed , or upraised in the center . I sent the first back but the replacement was just like it . Since the reissue guards have an extra pickguard screw right in the middle , its no biggie and its lying flat on my project bass just fine . Fit around the neck and against control plate was good . Do n't take a chance on an off brand , buy this for a guaranteed fit .
5 #### When I started out playing guitar , I was drawn to Elixir Strings from the recommendation of a friend . I used Elixirs exclusively for about 3 years , but after breaking what seemed like the 1000th " G " string , I started looking elsewhere . Another guitar playing friend pointed me to D'Addario EXPs & they are the only strings to touch my acoustic in the last 10 years . In the time I 've been playing EXPs , I 've only broken 1 string - a " B " string during a vigorous playing session . I usually change strings monthly , but I 've had their tone stay true for as long as 3 months on older / other guitars . Guitar tone is very subjective , so the best I can do is encourage you to try them & see if you like 'em .
1 #### Do n't waist your money . The cord is very short and does not respond well with speakers
5 #### Love these strings on my Martin DMXE Electric Acoustic . Bright sound , and man do they last !
4 #### Product works and function fine . I used it more for listening to talk radio . It does a fair job when listening to music , Very outstanding price for cheaper headset .
3 #### bought a bunch of these . Kind of hit and miss . Some worked well for charging and some do n't . Spend more and get better cables next time .
3 #### Used to flush one contaminated system using shop air . The quality of construction of the bottle and hose is good . The blower nozzle started leaking at the end of one use . I do n't believe the rubber seal is resistant to the flush chemical and the seal in the spray nozzle is n't replaceable . It 's a cheap tool and does the job but do n't plan on using it frequently . You will also need a pressure regulator to use this tool .
4 #### Great product . It holds up to the abuse it endures during my exercise routine . My iPhone 4s fits perfectly although I have to take it out of the case . Would recommend it to avid runners !
1 #### It worked but took over a month to receive ..
2 #### For the high price of 200 . Both Broke One usb charge plate broke off .... wo n't charge the other just fell apart the rubber its made out of wo n't last wires exposed broken I bought a wired head set for 2 dollars Giving 2 stars because plantronics replaced both headsets .
1 #### I purchased this last week here at Amazon through CCMAAccessories . However , this unit does n't charge . I plugged it in using the provided adapter and charging indicator light goes on red ( for a brief instant ) and then turns green ( again for a brief instant ) and then goes blank . The headset does n't get charged and I ca nt use it . I tried the provided USB cable with my computer - but again the same result . In this day and age - I expect electronics to work out of the box . I know I can return it - and I will - but the hassle is just too much . Now when I search for ' dead Jabra bt500 ' on google - I see many similar complaints about it not working out of the box .
5 #### I agree that this is the best shower radio . I have been through ( 3 ) other radios , all bad . This unit is true 100 % digitial , great reception , good sound quality , and easy to use .
1 #### Crap . Wires not soldered to clips . Clips Pull off easy
5 #### I have a Verizon iPhone 4 . I 've only installed one of the 3 screen protectors but it fit perfectly . Installation was easy , the price was right , and I 'm glad to have a couple of spares . Having a back protector is probably unnecessary for me since a case always covers the back of my phone , but I put it on anyway . I used the included cloth to help with installation but I have an old " card " from an Invisible Shield product I bought in the past and I used that to help too . I find having a hard object to press out the bubbles is a little more practical than a cloth - for me anyway . Update 5/2012 - This is a still a good screen protector for the price , but I found myself wiping finger prints off the screen more often than I remembered with my prior screen saver . I 'd forgotten that I previously used&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/SGP - iPhone-4 - Screen - Protector - Steinheil - Ultra - Series - Ultra - Oleophobic / dp / B003SQP986 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">SGP iPhone 4 Screen Protector Steinheil Ultra Series [ Ultra Oleophobic</a > ] on my phone . There was still a second one in the package so I took off the front screen of the protector in this review and replaced it with the spare . I 'm much happier , but be advised , the SGP is in a different price class .
5 #### Good price for this little case and seems to be made well enough to hold up for awhile . Would purchase again .
1 #### I pulled 30 inches of vacuum for 30 minutes on my Chevrolet s-10 pickup . I installed Cliplight 's ss pro 946 kit per instructions . My s-10 's ac blew ice cold at first ( 38 degrees ) for like 3 weeks ( same as last year ) , then I noticed the ac 's not as cold . Now it 's lucky to get to 70 degrees . It 's obviously leaking . $ 85 wasted ( 3 cans 134a synthetic and ss pro kit ) . The ss pro 946 kit is supposed to seal any existing and new leaks . A lot of great reviews but I do not think I will use again as SS Pro did NOT fix my trucks problem . A heads up : the red and blue tamper proof caps are NOT included in the kit any longer . You get the 1.5 oz . can of sealer , installation hose / tap and label in the box .
2 #### Did n't fit like it said it would fit . was to small .
5 #### works great , great price . note that this does not charge the phone , you still need a charger .
5 #### amazing i will never buy another brand again . soaked up the water in seconds .
5 #### This is a well made economical tripod . While best suited to a video camera it worked well for my DSLR as well .
4 #### These are doing just fine . Glad I got the pair instead of a single hand roller , as I needed exactly the small end of the big tips , and the big end of the small tips . Using on valves for a 4.0L V8 .
5 #### This product is idiot - proof to install and even easier to use . Quality of hardware and software has been well thought out and works effortless . Highlt suggest it to people with digital cameras for uploading files onto your P.C. This product appears as a new drive on your P.C. and interfaces as one . You do n't need luck to use this item , just enjoy it ! !
5 #### This was the cheapest price I have seen . The pictures came out great and it was just as described .
5 #### I 've used these strings for years , also always suggest them to everyone I know that has guitars . Long as they are around or in business I probably always will . color coded for accessibility and durable for me even know they are super lights but perfect .. if you have a six string buy these ... ca n't go wrong
4 #### The only reason I did n't give this 5 starts is because I 'm having a problem finding a place to hang it . NOT a product problem , it 's an issue with me and my vehicle ( I do n't want to block vents by attaching this to the passenger area in front . Also note mine came with a webbed , adjustable strap - not the string setup in the picture .
4 #### I really like these but the do n't sit on the back of the neck just right . They are a good headphone though .
3 #### Looks awesome and seems tough but the AC cable grommet coming out of the chassis can come loose after several shows ( this has happened on 2 of our 8 units ) . The outlets themselves have a little bit of rock / wiggle to them but it does n't affect use . Price is great .
5 #### Have used these before in other vehicles , Almost as good as a European headlamp .
2 #### These were okay when I first bought them ( several months ago ) . I was n't looking for any special quality or anything , just good basic headphones for running and working out . These are now broken . Basically I 'll say after one month , maybe month and a half , the earphone sides became loose and broke off the hinges that secure them . Realistically I wo n't give it 1 star because they were cheap and served those 30 - 40 days fair enough .
5 #### I highly recommend this product . Shooting with a less expensive zoom lens at 300X with a tripod , this time , everything came out crystal clear . Out of 300 shots I only had 1 a little with motion blur due to people moving very fast on - stage .
5 #### This cover fits my Virus&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Keyboard / dp / B000HKC7CM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Keyboard</a>&nbsp;and Korg Z1 perfectly . Even with a netbook and a desktop&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Evolver / dp / B0002GLCTU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Evolver</a>&nbsp;sitting on the Virus , the cover fits comfortably . When your keyboard is in use , the cover easily packs down into a tiny bundle ( no stuff - sack included , but a big zip - lock bag would probably do if necessary ) . I 'd like to see a smaller size for use with drum machines and other table - top boxes . Note that this does n't fit larger 76 - key keyboards like the Yamaha EX5 without extreme stretching . Although another reviewer said that it works well with the 76 - key Motif , I 'm a little skeptical .
3 #### This capo is certainly cool .. Sadly , mine seems to be wrapped with the scraps and is mostly just blue . Kiser Capos always wear out on me eventually . Until they do , they are still my trusted favorite . Mine in particular is just flawed .. Still gets me great compliments
4 #### Not flimsy , works well . Not much to say , it was what I expected .
5 #### Got these to compliment another pair of jack stands I own . Certain vehicle services require elevating the whole car , and these did quite well . Not too heavy to carry but solid in construction .
2 #### First , the product image is outdated and shows a different tool . Second , when I opened the amazon box , the tool was separate from the manufacturer 's packaging , which means I may have received a used tool . Lastly , the hook piece is not aligned perfectly with the handle . Overall , I 'm not overly pleased . The tool will work fine , but the shipping and quality of the tool is not first rate .
4 #### Worked as expected . Powered phone and other mini usb devices . Do not have any complaints . Saves time when on the go.j
3 #### not very stable vibrates a lot and comes loose easily
5 #### I own a few of these . They are good solid microsd cards , and work in most devices , even ones that say they only support up to 32 GB cards . Sadly , one I bought ended up having an issue , where it was stuck in read only mode . I could access and copy the data off it no problem , but could make no changes at all . For example , no deleting of data ( the files / directories would appear to be deleted , and then revert back ) , no new data ( would disappear ) , and the drive could not be formatted ( would error out ) . Trying to run repair utilities on it would also fail . The great thing about Sandisk , and why I use their cards almost exclusively , is that I was able to go online and fill out a warranty claim , and in less than 48 hours they sent me a postage paid mailing label to return the faulty card to them for a replacement . While the prices for sandisk microsd cards are often among the cheapest anyway , it 's worth paying a bit more to buy from a company that stands by their products 100 % and makes things so easy and quick for their customers who do happen to experience a rare problem . I 'm a loyal sandisk customer , and Sandisk is loyal to their customers who trust them with their data storage needs .
3 #### I bought these and i end up losing most of them before i need them again . the glass for the phone is already strong . just put it on smoothly and carefully and you 'll be set .
5 #### Used these covers to cover some 5.5inch off - road lights and these worked out great . They fit really snug and have n't faded in the slightest . Would definitely recommend these .
2 #### I bought it july 2014 and august 2015 it quit . Still looks new if that means anything . Guess we buy something cheap we just take our chances . Its a 50 year old car and it sits more than goes but speedometer was broke and was using tack to gage speed . Not the end of the world .... Robert
5 #### These strings are great to the touch . Gentle on the fingers and present a wonderful sound quality . I 've had no problems at all .
5 #### Heavy Duty , the real deal . Easy to use . Great for the library if you need to go to your car for something .
2 #### Sent 'em back - thank you Amazon ! - there was about a quarter turn of backlash in the focusing mechanism , and the eyepiece focusing mechanism on the right eyepiece did n't have sufficient range to focus that side in sync with the main focus .
5 #### HOSA Cables are as much a part of my music as the sounds themselves . I 've used these cables for years and they 've always performed 100 % . This particular cable is your basic MIDI to MIDI cable which I use to connect my synth to my audio interface and it works like a charm !
5 #### Best battery I 've had on my motorcycle . long lasting and started my bike every time for 7 years .
5 #### I bought a used copy of this lens and am extremely happy with it . I also have a 24 - 105 mm f4 kit lens and can say that duplication of the focal length was a little concerning ... however ... as far as shooting macro , you just ca n't get the same results with the tele - zoom ... the 100 mm macro gives razor - sharp results . Works great for portraits too if you 're a casual portrait shooter . If you 're worried about the IS on the " L " version being lacking on this lens ... consider that you 're likely shooting bugs and flowers etc and that outdoor lighting is pretty strong ... you 'll have pretty quick shutter speeds . It seems sharpest at about f8 or so ( like many lenses ) . If you shoot dimly lit stuff - get a ring light . A cheap one is probably fine unless you 're doing product photography or something like that , in which case , you 're probably getting paid and can spend the extra $ $ for a pro - quality ring flash . Just my 2 cents . I think it 's a great lens and a great addition to a kit if you already have a good long zoom , a good mid / wide zoom and a wide open prime like a 50 f1.8 or f1.4 or the 40 mm pancake , which is another bargain lens that you ca n't really go wrong buying .
5 #### I bought this to use on the road when driving my big truck . The noise cancelling works great . Whoever I am talking to hears nothing but me on the phone . It is light and comfortable to wear . My only complaint if any is that the mic tends to pull the hair on my face if I have n't shaved in a couple of days .
5 #### Otterbox is always ordered the same day I get my new phone . " .. do n't leave home without it . "
5 #### Work great with my TV at night so that I do n't have wait up my roommate .
4 #### Works great . The only change I 'd make would be to use a heavier gauge cable , but this one works fine .
1 #### The sound is horrible ... people say I sound like I am in a muffled tunnel . And I bought two , to have in case the BT ran down .... poor me ..... And my Plantronics 620 works like cr*p too . No noise cancellation worth a d*mn ... forget about using it when driving a car .... I am trying to find a new one ...
4 #### Good air fanning but somewhat noisy . Maybe I 'm spoiled by almost silent AC fans .
1 #### Cheap price , but the screen protectors were far too long for the Evo . Everything else I ordered fit the Evo , but not this . Not sure if the wrong item was shipped or what , but was not worth returning them .
4 #### works well as expected , item volume increases and decreases at will ,
1 #### The case I received is NOT as it was pictured on Amazon . I purchase it ONLY because I wanted exactly what was pictured . The case I received has an elastic band stiched into the leather side straps . This will fail over time and the cell phone will fall out . Do n't waste your time and money ordering what is pictured . That is not what you will receive .
4 #### Good value for the cost . The cans that come in the K&N kits are smaller and the cleaner out lasts the spray oil .
5 #### Awesome strap . Good quality and it makes me look like a pro with the grommets . And most of all , it 's very inexpensive .
5 #### have a hyundai with it built in on drivers side , works great for blind spots so i added this on another car and its great , ,
5 #### Simple - and works . This is just some HEAVY DUTY muscle to eliminate hitch slop . Drove through long expanses of North Dakota without incident . Kept my truck 's cargo tray absolutely stable regardless of terrain .
5 #### The Belkin 7 foot Cat 5e Cable works just as advertised . I use it as part of my power line home network and it delivers the data quickly . One of the best features of this cable is the jacks themselves . I 'm used to the crappy connecters that have a tendency to break , this is not an issue with the robust plastic sleeves on this cable . I highly recommend this product .
4 #### Ordered this on June 30th , and it arrived on July 19th . This was well before the estimated time of August 12th . When i ordered this i did not realize it was coming from China until my ordered went through . I gave it 4 stars because they feel a little cheap . I was under the impression they would be aluminum , they are plastic and very light . Either way they work great and only cost me a total of $ 1.35 including shipping . Ca nt complain !
5 #### I do n't go no where without my case ..... Love it ... I recommend this product to purchase on Amazon .... so so handy ... Thank you
4 #### It looks like what I wanted and have used in the past . Other chocks like this have kept my trailer from rolling .
4 #### This is my go - to film for unexpected lighting conditions . I like it 's consistency and I feel comfortable with its grain . Basically , I 've been shooting this film for a long time and it served me well .
5 #### Taylor Guitars ships their guitars with these strings . They know what they are doing . Great tone and long lasting . These are the ONLY strings I use for acoustic guitars . I have 3 Taylors and a J-160E - they all sound great with these strings . Note : I like the tone on the 80/20 Bronze better than the Phosphor Bronze - but that is just a personal preference . The 80/20 sound more like a traditional sound to me , but you ca n't go wrong either way .
4 #### The image is a little deceptive - it also comes with an additional vinyl protectant spray . The cleaner does a great job , and the microfiber towel is high quality ( it does shed ) . The brush could be better - the bristle hairs come off with each use . Otherwise , I highly recommend the product .
1 #### This was poor quality . There 's a version of a mirrored protector found on Amazon that offers a mirrored front and back for the phone which is much better .
4 #### yeah ... it 's a little more plastic than I would like ... but it 's OKay for the price . I DO like they fact that this 1 lights up for both braking AND lights .
5 #### This is actually the first pair of binoculars I 've purchased . We always had a pair when I was a kid when we would go on hiking trips , but that 's as far as my knowledge of binoculars goes . That said , these seem like a great pair of binoculars . I decided on these based on the small size and great reviews . I can throw these in my backpack and they 're so light I probably wo n't even know that they 're there . They feel well made . The attached cord seems a bit thin , but that is n't anything I really care about . I was surprised at how inexpensive these are , yet the quality appears to be excellent . They also include a carrying pouch so that you wo n't scratch the lenses .
5 #### Thanks ! I bought the actual Jawbone Prime off of someone for 10.00 ( brand new ) but it did not have the charger . Another 11 bucks for this adapter made it 25 ( with s&h ) for brand new earpiece ! Thank you , very much !
5 #### Great product , super easy to use . I fit a flat extension cord , a thick coax cable and an ethernet cable in there . Do n't think you could fit much more , maybe you could squeeze in an HDMI cable , but probably not . Adhesive is strong enough , fit and finish on the connectors is good , what more do you want ? Easy to saw through with a coping saw . Buy more than you think you 'll need is my only advice , I totally underestimated what I needed .
4 #### I read the reviews before I bought the GoGroove . They were extremely accurate . The sound quality is good ( listening with earphones is still the best quality ) . For the price and size they are great . My son has Bose speakers which are the best . However , he was extremely impressed with the GoGroove . We will be taking it on vacation with us .
5 #### I find so many hidden treasures in the free ebooks . This one is certainly a rare jewel : mult - facited , spell - binding , and in the end , truly beautiful . Beyond that , I dare not share one strand , or the story will unravel .
5 #### Bought these years ago . Have had to replace the ear cushions once . Still gets a little uncomfortable for long periods , but I stretched out the headband a bit for that . sound quality is still amazing .
1 #### Difficult to calibrate , never saw a clear picture . ordered a smaller one which works well . Be careful ... higher cost does not mean better product .
5 #### Not much to say . Good X - over . I have had no issues with it . I am using it for PToP.
5 #### 15 ft was the length I was interested in - for use in my home music room with both electric and acoustic - electric guitars and ukuleles . THis cord is quite lightweight and resists getting twisted up . The connector swivels are smooth and firmly mounted . There is no audible interference or feedback caused , sometimes , by cheaply made cables . For the price , there is simply no good reason to not go for these general - purpose cables ,
5 #### These folding " bags " are great ! They 're actually box - shaped and make great replacements for cardboard boxes in some instances . I use them for holding lots of different things : - groceries in the back of my pickup , - my winter survival gear , - unwrapped Xmas presents , - dry goods in the pantry , - an extra sleeping bag , - clean socks and underwear . The bags feature external web pockets , zipping covers , and sturdy handles . I do wish the sides were a bit stiffer since I do n't need to fold them very often anyway . The lack of stiffness is the only thing that keeps these bags from being the perfect cardboard box replacement . I bought about ten of these when they were on sale a while back . I wish I had bought at at least twice as many !
4 #### A cheap way to protect your costly lights . Fits good on the hella 500 's fogs I got . You have to take the covers off the lights to use em but not biggie . Clear ones are available but I like the looks of these . They do crack and get brittle over time which is the reason I replaced the orignials in the first place .
5 #### This battery is the same as the original battery that came with my phone . Many of even the OEM batteries with the same part number are not 710mah , but something less . I tried an off brand that did n't list it 's rating and it only lasted about half as long . With a little use this battery can last three days or more , where my old one was down to about half of one day with the same use .
5 #### I bought this for my 2014 corolla and it looks great .
5 #### These increased the pressure on the nut to keep the string in the groove of the nut during intense picking of hard rock , Made the guitar sound better
3 #### A good story . This book is reasonably well written and the story is decent . What more can you ask ? I liked it .
5 #### I think that I ordered these binoculars on a Wednesday and they arrived on a Saturday . I have been very impressed with how great they work and how clear the view is . I have been using them to spot shots on my target from a high power pellet gun . I have my paper targets set out about 50 yards and can typically see my shots without a problem . It has been a great help when spotting in my new scope .
4 #### I have gone through several upgrades since my first SM58 ... upgrades to mics with smoother responses , better detail on the high end , feedback rejection , etc . And yet ... I still keep coming back to it . This mic may not be the best sounding mic in the world , but it works . I find that if it sounds bad on my voice , my technique is more to blame than the mic is . The mic consistently has some muddiness around 250 ... but if you just cut the lows , you 're good to go . I also find that the high end is n't as pristine as more expensive dynamic mics ... but that does n't bother me so much , as some of that warmth can help my voice sit better in the mix . Every qualified sound man knows exactly what to do with this mic , it 's consistent , and darn near bullet proof . You will probably loose it before breaking it . You can spend thousands trying the latest and greatest option ... or you can buy this , one of the cheapest professional mics around , stick with it , and know that you are already using something that the best of the best use to achieve great results .
5 #### Bright and well made . Good mag - believe it really is 20x
1 #### In short , I had to return this dryer because it left spots on the surface of my black car . I tried not to dry it completely so I could wipe the mineral deposit spots off , but it was unavoidable to have some parts of the car dry . The water in the San Diego area is not specially hard . Also , it is a pain dragging the dryer around the garage floor , using an extension cord . It did n't save much time , and I 'm much happier back drying my new 2011 Honda Accord with old towels . The seller contact , David Bernstein , cooperated in refunding his $ 18 ( as I recall ) shipping cost , but not the $ 32.04 UPS charge to return it . He never acknowledged that the drier is not satisfactory for use on a black car , writing , " Sorry you do n't care for the product , " and somewhat strangely , " I understand what you are saying but everyone takes some ' risk ' buying online . " His refund policy was pretty good , but I would have been happier with a more customer - friendly tone .
4 #### I am very pleased with the sound of these headphones . It is detailed and well - balanced across the frequency range . I am happy to listen for extended periods and the headphones are comfortable . I can not comment on thumping deep bass because I listen to the wrong kind of music for that . I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago but gave them to a family member . This newer pair cost much less but sound every bit as good . On sound quality alone I would give these five stars but the construction is a bit concerning . Pulling on the extenders to lower the earcups feels as if it is pulling the headband apart . The old pair extended smoothly . I do n't know if quality has gone down or I just got a wonky pair . Since I can leave the earcups extended this is not an ongoing problem but it does raise questions about overall quality . I have n't had any other similar issues so far .
5 #### It 's good my mom uses it on her phone not a scratch very resistant and durabe buy with confidence . A
3 #### Way too small for most uses on a car IMHO . If they are fully extended they do n't look safe . Do yourself right and buy a pair of 6 tons . You wo n't regret it .
5 #### A must have in ur SUV or out going trailing . It 's portable so could use as hand held camping or 12v socket while out 4x4ing
5 #### Some guitarists say that coated strings lack clarity but the Elixir strings sound just right on my Breedlove Masterclass . I also use the Elixir strings made for Taylor on my Taylor 814ce . I think these are the best strings made .
3 #### I actually got a couple of these because the price was so cheap . I knew full well I was not getting a high - end product . Having dropped the phone once , it did what I wanted it to do -- cushion the fall and protect my Pre Plus . However , it came off the phone and broke one of the tabs in the process . It still works , though ! :) Another negative is that the plastic is not colored black everywhere . I took a black permanent marker and colored the white areas on the tabs , but it was annoying . One other plus for this product is that it works with the Touchstone charger . However , the one in my truck is mounted at an angle on the dash and the magnet is not strong enough ( or the case is too thick ) to hold the phone on the charger . That really sucks , but the Seido case that is also Touchstone compatible is a lot more money , and I do n't know that works at an angle either ! Overall , it 's probably only a two - star product , but I 'll give it a third star because it works with a flat - mounted Touchstone base .
4 #### K&N air filter oil . Aerosol is better than the pump spray . Does a good job of re - oiling . READ THE LABEL ! Do n't over - oil .
1 #### buy this product again and came in very bad condition , not the tray where you put the sim , the charger does not work . I think that you should not send the phone in very poor condition . I need to solve this case soon . as for that canceled 150 dollars . to get a new computer , not in such bad shape
4 #### I 've been listening to and reading a lot of books over the past year . Often they fall short of expectations . Many are too wordy or the plot is weak or the pace is too quick or too slow . Nightfall however , is a real standout . It 's a wicked detective mystery , framed with suspense and paranormal machinations . Devils and demons , witchcraft and death spiral around the main character , Jack Nightingale . The story is rich and compelling as it follows Jacks introduction to the occult and his growing knowledge of his own cursed soul . The rich storytelling and intrigue have me hooked and I m looking forward to the next novels in the series . For those who prefer to listen rather than read , the performance of Ralph Lister as narrator , is awesome . His warm gravely tone lends a sense of mystery and thrill to the captivating prose .
3 #### Does what they said it does . Only thing is they said you do n't have to wash it every time but after drying 2 cars I put it away damp like they said and took it out a week later to wash my car ( I wash my cars a lot ) and it had a mildew smell to it . So i wash it every time .
5 #### Classic quality you expect from D'Addario . All packs came in well in order . Have had them on my LP custom and Ibanez for about 3 months now and they still ring like the day I put them on .
5 #### this rubber case kept my phone secure and looking brand new . protected it from falls and scratches .... a must have on any blackberry
5 #### Best banjo strap ever . I 'm only a 6 month beginner on the banjo , but been playing guitar for 40 years . I was first using a guitar strap which was not comfortable with the banjo , because it is a heavier instrument , and it was pulling wrong on my shoulder and neck . I read the reviews on this one , the price was right , and I 'm glad I did . Feels perfect , even though I do sit to play for now , I 'm sure doing standing performance would even be great too . Great product if you need comfort .
3 #### The clamp is very powerful so it 's a little hard to put on and it pulls the strings sharp . This is my least favorite capo but it works and you do n't break the bank when you lose them .
4 #### Nice fold out quick guide , must have for new Nikon D90 owners ! ! Saves going thru manual out in the field
4 #### Cost efficient . perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily . like it alot . will probably buy more next year ;)
4 #### I bought this for a wedding since the client wanted a retro mic . It works great and sounds really good . The only bad thing is the connection which get 's in the way of the stand connection .
5 #### love these picks but I ca nt understand why I still co not sound like Jimi ? ? ?
5 #### I have been using this charge for a few months now and I am very happy with its performance . 7000mAh is a pretty good amount of power in a small ( about the size of a deck of cards ) convenient travel size unit . I take it with me camping or any travel I do to juice up my phone or tablet . I like how it has a 1A port AND and 2.1A port for phones and tablets .
5 #### I use this more than any other item in the shop and have never regretted purchasing it a few years ago . It truly is bomb proof . So buy once and be done with it . On a side note , Amazon CS was excellent in shipping a replacement unit overnight after UPS " lost " the first one .
5 #### Wonderfully clear headphones , open ear is a great feature . Not good for pumping bass , very good for listening to the intricacies of your music and enjoying it like it were new .
2 #### Would n't hold a charge after a couple weeks of regular use
5 #### One of the standards for a trumpet player . If you 're stuck on a 5C in high school , it 's time to move up ! I did , and I 'm glad I did back then .
5 #### I first heard these Custom Shop 60s pickups in the Adam Clayton signature Jazz bass and thought they sounded amazing . I recently purchased a CIJ Fender Jaguar bass and decided to replace the stock pickups with these bad boys . The difference is night and day . They sound SO good with the active EQ . I could not recommend these pickups more . I might even pop them in my MIM Deluxe also .
5 #### I love mine , sounds amazing & the price is a must !
5 #### I 've used many different brands of strings in the last 40 years and these Super Slinky 's have always been one of my favorites . If you like to bend the strings for that special sound these are great .
5 #### This is a purchase my husband made . He 's a professional musician and is very particular when he has to restring a guitar . These are great quality and he 's given them an A+ .
3 #### The product description clearly states it fits Lenovo ThinkPad X220 , X220 t , X220s , X220i . But it most certainly does not fit my Lenovo X220 t Tablet . The picture on the site is what my keyboard looks like , but a very different item was delivered to me . It 's not even close . 11/17/13 UPDATE : contacted the seller via Amazon 's very efficient and private customer feedback system . Per their request , I sent them a picture of the computer and incorrect item to show the difference . They are sending a replacement . Very quick response . Upgrading to three stars . Will update again after new item arrives . By the way , to ensure you get the color you want , after placing the order , send a customer feedback within ten minutes telling them which color you want . It actually worked . I asked for and received yellow , just the wrong model number unfortunately .
4 #### Nice buy but all the rivets are 1/8 with various lengths . Probably my fault for not reading more carefully but I wish there were a greater variety of diameters and head sizes . 4 Stars because the rivets are good but not 5 stars for the reasons above
5 #### I really do n't know why this can not be sold in CA . But it eventually made it .
3 #### The pump worked good but just be careful pulling on the pump handle . The third or fourth time I tried to prime the pump the little round handle came right off in my hand . It did n't render the pump useless but I was a little surprised at how easily it came off .
5 #### The Trent appearance - wise & feel is much nicer than even their well - taken photos can show . It actually has some curve & differing depth to it ... giving it a sleek and sexy feel . It charges with good speed and holds a lot of additional reserve charge within it for future charging of my Iphone . The only problem I currently have with The Trent is that I somehow " misplaced it ~1 - 2 weeks ago " and though I 've searched & searched for it , so far it has all been to no avail . Guess I 'll be begging for one on Father 's Day .
4 #### I was having problems burning DVDs in my Macbook Pro SuperDrive . Bought this and did n't realize it said " not for use in laptops " until after inserting disk and it getting ejected without being recognized by the drive . BUT ... it worked ! Tried burning a DVD afterwards and it worked . I guess it spinning in the drive trying to be recognized did the trick . How 'bout that ...
1 #### Not worth the money I spent . Not the sellers fault it 's just the product is poor quality , cheap and flimsy . I do n't even use it .
4 #### Easy to install and does a great job of protecting the Droid body . I bought a separate screen protector because one is not included with this product . I recommend to keep your Droid looking new .
5 #### I ordered this for my wife , who has no integrated BT feature in her car . The set - up was easy . Out of the box , we were able to pair her iPhone in less than a minute . After a letting it fully charge , it was ready to go . The magnetic mount makes it easy to place / remove it when running in and out of the car . The magnet 's also strong that it makes it feasible to open the mic using only a 1 - finger , simple push pops it out . Based on her feedback , it 's easy to use and the speaker is loud . I 've talked to her while she 's using it and I could clearly her her . She loves it and I 'm glad I chose this product .
2 #### We use an S4 and Note 2 . The Note 2 is tight , the S4 fits fine . Sticks to the window shield fine . The method for locking and releasing is very poor . This was cheap and it will go were many cheap things go , in the garbage .
3 #### The outside screen protector would n't bend at all and would n't stick down ... therefore making the top protector completely useless even when install correctly . The inside protector works perfectly fine , but i think the outside one is really the needed one ... So 3 stars because it only half worked .
2 #### Cheap and does not hold many picks less if you use thicker ones . Hard to get picks out too .
3 #### I did n't care for their tone or feel as much as either DR Pure Blues or Thomasik Jazz Swing flats .
3 #### this is a great case i just do n't use it that much because it does nt really protect my phone from being damage
5 #### Bought to replace another that I bought for my wife a year ago and it is great . Not heavy , stand work the way it should and it fits like a glove . Gives grate stability to the slippery side of the phone and allows for one handed function .
2 #### Cable was rather cheaply made and was advertised as 6 ' yet was only 4 ' 3 " . Item was returned .
5 #### The Pork Pie thrones are fantastic ! I liked my first one so much , I bought this one so I could leave one at home with my practice set and one at our practice space with my other set . They 're a little pricey , but how much is comfort worth to you ? At our marathon rehearsal today , I was on this thing at one point for 2 1/2 hours STRAIGHT before we took a break , without ever standing up . No sore butt , no sore back , and I 'm 53 -- so that 's saying something ! If you 're on the fence about one of these , fork over the money and GET one ! Your butt and back will thank you !
5 #### Just used this mike today on a hike . Worked great and I love having my radio out of the way in a pocket on my backpack with this mike handy on my bags shoulder strap on my chest . Mike is high quality , sound is great for a mike / speaker , and I like the rotating clip on the back so the mike can be oriented in an optimal position . I 'm going to order another one for my other radio . By the way , my radio is a Motorola Talkabout T460 .
5 #### These jack stands are very high quality . Nicely made . If this is the support capability and lift requirement for you , these are the stands . Safety ' lock ' as well .
3 #### Cute case for iphone . Nice design but the case is not as colorful as pictured , and is not shiny at all . Good value for the price but it 's not my favorite cover . .
5 #### Great Item and fits on my Surco rails . Sits a little high , but not a big deal . this goes great with a safari rack .
5 #### Amazing tone , great feel . I use them on my Taylor 814 , which tends to sound pretty bright . The light - mediums help give better low - end when playing live .
5 #### I 've had my phone for about a month , and so far , I really like it . I 'm not too crazy about the absence of voice dialing , but overall , the phone is awesome . Volume is loud and clear . Controls are easy to use . Texting is a breeze . The camera should have had a flash but it 's still nice . The BEST part of all , was the price ... 1 cent ! Ya ca n't beat that .
4 #### Love the chic design , excellent cover and surface pad . Would only recommend some storage for cards/ notes , but then would compromise sleekness .
5 #### These liners will protect your vehicle carpet . They are easy to remove and clean .
4 #### Have n't had any compatibility or driver problems with it , however I have n't noticed anything special about it that makes it worth the extra price over the under [ money ] generic LAN cards that I also use on my home network . Most new computers come with onboard ethernet anyway so check your computer before you buy this to see if you actually even need it . There 's probably a plug around back ( if you bought your computer in the last 2 years ) that looks like a really big phone cord plugin - that 's for a cat-5 ( RJ-45 ) ethernet cable to plug into and that should be all that you need to connect to your router / hub / cable modem .
5 #### Easy to paint to blend in . They stick to the wall fine . Hardly noticeable if put against window molding or base .
5 #### Very easy to put together and these tops / bottoms will outlast the boards . Used with the Ramparts rubber ramp mats makes for some great looking and very functional ramps . I gave my 2x10 's a couple coats of polyurathane just to help protect the wood . You will be pleased with these !
3 #### Paid $ 45 a bottle . Meguires ultracut cheaper and worked a little better for me .
5 #### The Kyser capos are easy to use . I 've never had a tonal issue using one .
4 #### Great product , compact and clear . Earpiece is a bit stiff but everything else about it more makes up for that
5 #### Awesome This is for amazon . Change your word requirements . Do nt force nobody to comment or write a review . one word is all i need . if its bad , then still , one word is all i need . you guys make a person not wanting to wright anything .
5 #### I use it to tune all of my instruments [ and frighten animals ] Always handy and precise . Makes tuning my guitars a breeze . superior to digital tuning because you can actually feel the vibration , and not a degraded emulation of that . If you can not get down to the details of an instrument beyond the systems used to manipulate it , then you are not close enough to the instrument . That goes for the configuration on an instrument too . This fork is the foundation of much of that .
5 #### The batteries work great . I use them in my calculators and calipers .
1 #### Did nt work right out of the package on a brand new iphone 4 . Well it kind of worked if you wanted to sit there and hold the plug at an angle to make it charge .
5 #### Money well spent . This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected . I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend .
2 #### The case is loose , not fit well and broke easily without impact . I do not recommend ... wef efded edeqwd edweqd wqdwq dqwd wqq wdqwd wqd
5 #### Works fine with my Rebel XTi ( 450D ) . Easy to use , cord can be extended with a universal cable .
5 #### Easy to operate . Compact with a nice clicking , metronome type sound . Adequate packaging . Nicely priced . Very pleased so far . 5V battery not included .
5 #### What else can you say ? It 's made by DW ..... well made ... good design . My teenage drummer son loves it on his key chain .
4 #### While I like the fact that this product gives you adequate control of the volume ( up & down ) of my headphones , that do n't have their own , separate volume control , the product would have been better , if it had just a bit more volume output . But , it is a good product .
4 #### It only holds 5 heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok . The tapered design might be to make picks eject easier ? I never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to . Except . I did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars . These are good do n't get me wrong .
4 #### I liked these a lot but the only problem I did n't pay for bent ones . All three had a dent in them . I know it was n't supposed to be there because they all were in different spots .
5 #### It does his job . I needed a guitar bag to keep the guitar in my room safe from dust and " accidents " . This bag does the trick . It 's easy to carry and protects the guitar from scratches , dust and a few rain drops ( not a storm ! ) . I 'm happy with it .
5 #### bought this alongside the Naztech red & silver case . I wo n't buy anything but matte screen protectors and this one held up for 4 - 5 months of use . after that lost it 's matte feel , but it 's a good deal being that you get quite a few for a good price . would recommend & buy again if I still had the phone .
5 #### D.A. Wolfe below is absolutely incorrect . This thing does not shift at all . I have no idea what he means by he has to " baby it around corners . " This is a great mount and keeps the unit from sliding in all situations . I do off roading and it still does n't move . I have a Nuvi 360 and use it in a Tacoma . It truly rocks and is easy to remove and keep in my console with GPS still attached when not in use .
5 #### buen vendedor el producto llego en buenas condiciones , lo recomiendo muy bonito cell y tiene buen precio pueden comprar con confianza
5 #### I found that it was a steal to buy this cable at such a low price . Excellent product .
1 #### Do n't expect images like you get on your cell phone ! Pictures are grainy , soft , and unless you are in a well lit are , they come out bland . With the total cost of purchasing two of these , and developing the images , I could have bought a cheap digital sports camera with much better results . 800 asa film does n't cut it anymore .
1 #### I bought the card and took it on an international trip . I put the card into my phone and went to the site to activate it , and it said to put in 19 - 20 numbers , but there were about 30 numbers and letters on the sim card . It was worthless .
5 #### I was looking for a mini mixer so that I could plug in portable devices , I acquire first one in RadioShack , what a disappointment when I figured it out it used a battery , ( a squared one ) plus it was mono only , then I decided to go with the Behringer which came in working perfectly and in the optimal size , what I omitted is to double check if it had stereo output , the fact is no , there is no output , only mono , for mics . and others that require only that is a great working device , yet I was still in my search of a budget small sized mixer with stereo outputs , I found this in amazon and so far up to this point , it has worked great , I can have stereo output ( note : the mixer says 4 channels , but one of them is mono for a mic ) three are stereo , yet it worked great for what I needed it for .
5 #### It 's a Capo and it works well on my 6 string Acoustic . It is a bit stiff but I think in time using it it will loosen up a bit . I went with gold as I always get everything silver or black so I decided to change up a bit . Anyhow , I am enjoying it !
5 #### As always , this product works very well , lasts a long time , and is versatile . I use it on my bathroom mirror too , to keep it crystal clear during hot showers , and to repel toothbrushing splashes .
5 #### Not perfect on our first trial effort for a TV show , but close enough . We just need a bit more experience , I suspect . It supplies a need that we never expected to fill and at a really reasonable price .
5 #### This is a good clear and crisp head . the holes in it definatley increase the volume it puts out and also attract alot of people to the snare . I can not say how many times people have said to me ( Dude ! what s that crazy head you ve got on there ! )
5 #### I 've put these on the last 4 or 5 trucks I 've owned and wo n't be without them . On my Toyota Tundra I could n't even crack the window in the rain without getting water inside the cab . With these on my interior stays dry . Installation is simple and only takes 15 minutes for all 4 .
5 #### I had to buy several of these because people keep taking mine . I take mine everywhere and there 's always one in my tool box , well , people use my tool box , and the next thing I know , I 'm missing another gauge . This item is a little on the bulky side , but it quick , reliable , and it gets the job done . It 's also nice looking enough to be given as a gift so I really like these and would definitely recommend it to anyone . I 've also tested it and it 's accurate to 1 psi . Meaning , of all of these I 've owned , the most they 've ever been off was by 1 psi .
2 #### This case is too small for any phone that has ANY kind of a protective case on the iPhone . Regretibly I ordered two of them . It it has the ' Tan ' leather inside , it 's too small if you have any kind of a protective case on your phone .
3 #### ... it 's not all gravy . Verizon 's MiFi worked fine when I had it , but it proved too costly . Now I 'm using Virgin Mobile 's ( VM ) MiFi ( same device that Verizon uses : Novatel MiFi 2200 ) but you * may * get a better deal . I say " may " because my download speed with VM is pretty dismal , though with VM you get no usage caps for $ 40 month , as opposed to Verizon 's $ 60+/month with a 5 GB cap . So , be aware that Verizon is overcharging big - time but , conversely ( at least for me ) , VM 's MiFi is painfully slow . Welcome to another fine example of " You can have your cake but ca n't eat it " world of high - tech .
5 #### this came in a timely manner and was oem . It works well and filled the need I had for a replacement battery .
4 #### Considering the price these look and work very well . Do not expect to get a solid metal mirror , it is made out of plastic , but for the price it works and look good .
5 #### After pricing out a multitude of other models and comparing personal comments I purchased this jack from Amazon.com . After the jack arrived I used it to lift the vintage Mustang off the ground where it stayed all night long . It 's only fair to say I have used it just a few times so far but I 'm ready to replace my other jack with another one of these .
3 #### I have had a love affair with the Olympus D490 now for 2 years . And up until very recently , I would have sung nothing but praises for this camera . ( In spite of the stupidity of having to manually open and close cover to turn camera on / off and/or view pictures ) We got along great , we went everywhere together , I had decided that this camera was the love of my life ... UNTIL ... tragedy struck . This damn bastard camera just up and gave out one day . No warning , no " dear john letter " no nothing ... just abandonment and betrayal . And things were going so well for us too ! How was I to know that complete heartbreak was right around the corner ? I do n't know if I can ever trust or love another camera again . And if I do , you can bet it 's not going to be an Olympus . For the 400.00 + I spent on this baby 2 years ago ( and yeah , i know the prices have come way down) .. I would have expected this thing to last longer than it has . In closing ... enjoy your D490 while you can ... but know in your heart that your joy is fleeting , and that like all good things in life ... the joy comes to an end and leaves you miserable and alone ( cameraless ) . Merry Freaking Christmas .
4 #### Fits my 96 Eclipse GSX perfectly , however I was disappointed it did n't have a black ground wire . Also with this harness and an aftermarket deck it does n't allow for the stock amp without Metra 70 - 7003 , but that had nothing to do with this harness , just a heads up for others with factory amps . Other than needing to route your own ground wire it 's a good harness especially for the price .
4 #### better construction than OEM , enclosed wiring not so great , be sure to have your own connectors and longer wire .
5 #### Maybe this on my steering wheel will send the theiving bastards to the next car that does n't have one . Cheaper than the deductable on your insurance .
5 #### I have been using these for a while and they work well in my opinion . After you get them applied correctly they usually last me a year or more . You should have no bubbles at all after application . The price on these is unbeatable !
4 #### Works as advertised and a good style but it is not super heavy duty . It only held up about 4 months with constant use .
5 #### Heavy duty ! This thing is definitely keeping my vinyl safe . The only step in protection above this is the road case style , and beyond that a bomb shelter . Love the carpet ! Lid comes off so it 's not in the way !
5 #### I 've been buying these headsets for several years , recommending them to friends and associates and now I 'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged . You know , people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders . These are wonderful headsets . I 've used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones . As long as you have a 2.5 mm socket , you 're in business . Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss . And the microphones are simply top - notch . I 've had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed . With regard to ordinary daily abuse , these hold up well . All in all , an excellent value . Jerry
2 #### Ugh - did n't like these strings at all . Not a good feel or tone , in my opinion . Perhaps , it 's for a certain kind of guitar player . I 'm primarily rhythm , with the occasional lick here and there and have been accustomed to coated strings . I would n't buy these again .
5 #### I bought this to go in a rack with other equipment . It serves the purpose in being able to connect all the computers in several racks using only one connection to the outside world . Especially liked the self seaking feature in that it makes no difference which port you use for upstream or downstream connections .
4 #### Is a good strong cable , I would have prefered to be slightly longer . However it does the job and is not as flimsey as several I puchased on Amazons are . I definetly reccommend it . Is a good valuefor the moneyand is hardy . KarlaC
4 #### I bought these DOT - compatible headlights to upgrade the sealed beams on my 1994 Miata : there are no instructions but installation is straightforward - the same as replacing any sealed beam . They fit well . Subjectively , low beams seem brighter and high beams significantly so . I did n't check the bulbs , but the boxes and housings were both marked , ' Made in Germany . ' Lenses are glass . NOTE : the rubber seals that came with mine were different than those pictured . Each seal had a single large hole - you push the hole down onto the bulb housing where it makes a tight seal , then plug on the connector .
1 #### Voice instructions in Chinese and instruction book written for different phone . You can barely read the fine print . Even after charging and battery charging said it was done , kept getting warning message that battery was low ! Says it has aTouchscreen ? Bluetooth ? A piece of junk . Got the LED light to come on ! ! !
4 #### Bought this for my brothers ( new to him ) truck for his birthday ( after his water pump wore out ) ... I have n't seen it nor used it ( he 's 2.5 hours away ) . Had it delivered direct to him .
5 #### I use the LiquidAUX with my Samsung Moment and it works great ! Each time I turn on the car it syncs within 10 - 15 seconds . The steering wheel attachment is not too bad if you tighten it up well ( can rotate a little if it 's loose ) . In the Moment you can select media profile and phone profile separately . Since I use a Motorola H700 headset , I only selected the media profile ; it will still stop the " radio " when a call comes in ! ! ! I use this with Slacker Radio ( streaming service ) and a small USB FM transmitter ( no longer manufactured by SIIG ) and the audio is wonderful ! It 's easy to move to a company car for long trips . I 'm very pleased with my Amazon purchase .
5 #### Super cheap cable , does a super job . Still going strong today . It 's a no brainer to buy one ! I 'll definitely purchase more ( if I have to ! ! ) Very happy
4 #### I have n't tried it yet but I 'm sure it will serve my needs .
4 #### I purchased K&N filters for my cars and this cleaner cleans filter very well . Make sure you lay filter on top of paper towels to absorb excess oil . This will keep your MAF sensor from getting dirty with K&N Oil
5 #### I bought this as a extra , so that when I change the oil I will have a new one . It look to be of great quality and I am sure it will work just fine .
5 #### The first thing I noticed about this radio was how quiet it was ! In the city there is almost always a ton of background chatter . With the squelch set just over the noise level only talk came through when there was talk that could be heard . I have n't had time to put the radio on the road but I 'm impressed so far ! It is made to move from car to car and does so easily . A magnet mount antenna and a 12V power port and you 're on the air ! Included are a " rubber ducky " antenna , alkaline battery pack , and rechargeable battery pack to turn the radio into a walky / talky . The recharge pack is the one point I 'm not sure of yet . A power pack can be plugged into the side rather than taking batteries out and putting them back in for charging . What 's not clear is which battery type can be used ( Ni - Cd or NIMH ) . Convention would be Ni - Cd . I will do an update at a later time when I find out more . ... Mark
4 #### Have lived in a null area for 7 years , receiving calls on my patio . Finally took the plunge , bought and installed Wilson DT booster . I had few options in terms of distance relationships . Installed the system right at minimum requirements for distance and geometry , BUT I CAN CALL AND TALK in my house for the first time in 7 years .
5 #### What else could you ask for in a bulb . , Unlike cheapo high wattage bulbs , the Hella product goes the distance . Just make certain your install is vibration free . Excessive vibes can shorten the useful life of any bulb . I use these in my DTRL and believe me they get plenty of notice even on really sunny days !
5 #### I purchased this high hat stand for the youth room at the church i work at to replace the cheap broken one we were using . I went with the DW 700 because of the price and the positive reviews . Various drummers , including myself play using this high hat stand several times per week . First of all , when i received the high hat stand , i could n't believe they fit it in such a small box ( a little over a foot ! ) After opening and assembling , which was fairly easy ( i have assembled many other models before and this one is very similar ) i put some high hats on it and played it for a while . The stand feels solid and similar to more expensive $ 200 + models i have played on . Pedal was comfortable and felt solid . High hats when raised by the spring sat parallel with each other and without touching . It does n't want to fall over either . I would recommend this high hat stand to anyone . Especially in a setting where the kit will be played by lots of different , unprofessional drummers and be abused . Mine is holding up well !
3 #### I feel like my expectations for bluetooth headsets are either too high or the technology is crappy . I 've bought bluetooths for 10 $ and all the way up to this one for about 30 $ and its all the same quality . This particular one just hangs on my ear so if i turn my head to quickly ( ie ; driving ) it will fall off or loosen . If you want an OK bluetooth then you can get the same quality for cheaper .
5 #### Update 03 - 04 - 2014 Everyone should have one of these . It 's come in handy so many times , especially for people whom travel a lot for business or pleasure . I love that it is a USB charger as it can be used for any such device that supports such . Would I like it to charge longer ? Who would n't ? One full cell phone charge is more than tolerable for the size / price . Original review : If you 're looking for the simplest of conveniences , look no further . This product does exactly what you need it to do which is charge your phone one full charge where you may not be able otherwise . Elegant design , simple operation . Fits comfortably in your pocket or purse . Built in LED flashlight and Laser Pointer are a plus . Great peace of mind product ! FYI , I get 1/2 a charge on my iPad from this device and a full charge on my ipod .
5 #### After years of owning a CryBaby , I 'm glad I finally got this adaptor . No more fiddling with empty batteries , just plug the stuff et voil&agrave ; !
4 #### A good cable for a reasonable price . You can spend more on cables but this will get the job done . So far no problems at all with this one .
5 #### Gibraltar is the King of the drumming world in my opinion . These may be such a small addition to your cymbal set up , but one of the most needed when it comes to the sound of the cymbals . The size is perfect . And the price is unbeatable
5 #### Works great and no problems ! As described and perfect fit for 2001 GMC Jimmy 4.3L
5 #### I had my body shop install these , they were n't the easiest to put on at home , but my truck was in the shop for paint when i ordered them anyway . They 're made very well , have n't had a single scratch or ding in my paint from rocks kicked up since they were put on
5 #### A++++ item as pictured . Does what it is supposed to do . Recommended !
5 #### I love this product to protect my kids cell phones . It works better than most of the other screen saver products I have bought .
5 #### I have absolutely no gripes with Elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings . I have been using them since the first appeared on the scene and have become my go - to brand . I 've read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage . I have yet to ever break an Elixir acoustic guitar string ( in over 10 years of playing them ) . Ca n't even imagine . The only other coated string that may be a little better is Clear Tone -- but I have had inconsistencies with them and because they cost more , I just go with Elixir and am never disappointed . I 'm not a fan of the " Polyweb " which has a much more visible thick coating . The nano - webs get it right -- they last a long time , sound great , and as far as I know do n't flake polymer dust in your kisser .
5 #### This is what you need to get for removing oxidation from your topsides .
5 #### nice mats great colors put them in at car shows would buy again
4 #### Have it in my car and use it when needed . I like the fact I can charge more than one device with it .
5 #### Somebody asked the question whether or not this is the same as the Green Gorilla Snot ? The answer is 100 % yes . Hopefully it does n't dry up like my other one does . Definitely a little bit goes a long way . It helps you hold onto your sticks if you 're a drummer .
5 #### I spent the extra tens bucks for a factory battery over the " extended same size battery " for a couple of reasons . Countless tech guys have measured those " extended " batteries and they either measured the same maH total and run time or worse . Some off brands have been known to not charge inside the phone . And we have all read about those stories of cheap and even " brand name " batteries bursting open . For me I rather spend the extra money and have the warranty and assurance that HTC will give me vs some overseas brand I may never get a response from .
5 #### I saw the mixed reviews but went ahead and took a chance on this . I am happy to report that it was in fact 3 feet and works perfectly connecting my modem to my computer . The price was great the big box store wanted $ 25 for a 6 foot cord . This is a great value for a small space and it looks just like the picture . I recommend the product .
5 #### I am very pleased with these guitar strings and would recommend to any one that I know . Thank You very much
3 #### This unit works OK . The concept is GREAT . It gets 3 stars as follows : The pump is a total pain in the butt to hold onto the bulbous tank fitting . Yes , I know I could put some jelly or lube or soap or something around the ring to help it seal better , but I should n't have to . I have seen competitors ' models that have a threaded attachment for the pump handle . The good about the current setup on this item is if the handle gets knocked around , it just falls off . If the unit had a threaded fitting , and it gets knocked around , the handle would most likely break off at the threads or worse , rending the device most likely inoperable . Also , in order to get the fluids out of several generators , air compressors , and lawnmowers , I had to remove the smaller diameter hose from this unit . It sucks just fine now using the larger diameter hose . Again , it should have worked just fine out of the box . I should not have to modify a brand new product . I like the stability of the bulbous design . I like the ability to pour the oil right back out the hole it came in once the siphon tube is removed . If I had it to do all over again , tho , I would buy something different . It DOES work , but it could be better .
1 #### I do n't like Ernie Ball strings . Period . Just my humble opinion .
5 #### Love this stuff . Applied it about five weeks ago . Sheds water like a fresh waxed new car . Brought back that deep black new look . Very happy with the results . Follow directions and Do n't apply on a windy day . Jeep wrangler soft top .
5 #### These are my favorite drum sticks ever . They are really good for developing arm / wrist strength and endurance as they are a bit heavier and bigger than what most people play with . They last a very long time and are perfect for the heavy hitter or rock player like myself ( they are n't limited to just rock though . ) You will develop muscular strength and better stick handling much quicker , in my opinion , using a thicker stick like these 2Bs . Plus Vic Firths are just the best bro . 10/10 my go to .
5 #### They say opposites attract . I 'm a gadget freak , my wife is a gadget hater , so I guess it 's true . I bought this headset because I no longer wanted to be one of those pinhead drivers who threaten the safety of everyone else by driving with their cell phone plastered to their ear . The H620 enjoys excellent battery life , is attractive , small , very light weight , and fits perfectly in my ear . I hardly know I 'm wearing it . I bought it because the package said it had special audio features , like noise cancellation and an echo inhibitor , that made it ideal for use in a moving vehicle . I must admit that when I talk with people from my car , they do n't seem to realize I 'm wearing a headset . I called my wife and said , " Honey , I 'm wearing a new wireless headset , how does my voice sound to you ? " She answered " OK , I guess - not bad at all . " Believe me , that 's VERY high praise coming from my wife . It does n't get any better than that . This thing MUST be good .
5 #### After I isolated the problem with my RV furnace to the Igniter Board , I had no trouble locating Dinosaur Electronics with a quick Google Search . Their website is crystal clear on what I needed to order and what it would fit INCLUDING a part number cross reference that included the part number off my bad board . Copied the Dino part number and nomenclature and pasted in Amazon , BOOM there it was and was eligible for Prime ! Bought it instantly . Checked prices elsewhere and no contest . Total transaction time : Less than 15 minutes . Arrived 4 days later ( over the weekend ) minute , < 5 minute install , furnace lit on first igniter cycle . FLAWLESS A+++++++ outfit even if they recommend trained installers put this board in . Highly recommended , and I 'm a card carrying curmudgeon .
5 #### The ZYEX Synthetic Core Strings , in this case for violin , have ended a long search for a dependable synthetic core string which sounds similar to strings priced three times as much , but are a medium tension . Being a medium tension string , each string will hold it 's tuning for a much longer period of time without the constant adjustment of re - tuning . With a medium tension , the string to neck pressure required to double block or vibrato is much less than the high tension strings . The ZYEX strings are ball end , colored red / white at the ball end and each is different within the peg box . Their tone is warm , smooth , and although wrapped , they are tightly bound . The A - string comes in either aluminum or silver ( for a difference in price ) . I have purchased ZYEX strings as standbys for each of my three violins for their next routine changes . I really have found nothing of fault with these strings and I have a box full of rejected , and expensive , trial sets which never made the grade .
5 #### I love these mufflers . They sound great on my big block Ford engine . It gives it a mild performance tone at idle and a nice tone when revved up . If you are wanting a performance muffler that does n't sound brash , outflows a Flowmaster and affordable , then I would recommend these for your vehicle .
5 #### still doin' it 's job just fine - what more can you axe for out of a cable ? I think the price was good too
5 #### all good , camera fits with other lenses , or with the whole thing assembled . enough amount of pockets and space . Good for taking the basic kit around
5 #### I ordered this for a lantern i bought at a salvage store , so I did n't want to spend much . I think this will work great . I received it in 3 days and it works great so far . I priced one in town and it was 21 dollars , this one was 10 . I love getting a good deal .
3 #### The slow charge port ( 1A ) blew out on this . I have no idea why but they do not make for easily changeable fuses anywhere .
5 #### I bought this charger because it was the same as the one that came with one of my phones and I liked its form factor as well as the build quality and the quality of the charge cable that came with it . Once it arrived I ordered two more because it works perfectly with all the devices I have charged with it . ( Incredible , Thunderbolt , iPhone , Optimus and two other USB devices ) . I am going to order 5 more of them for use at the company I work for .
5 #### Works great , have used for several years on a number of vehicles after my first two encounters with deer , one totaling the vehicle , the other causing much damage . I travel in a highly populated deer area daily , at all hours , with many deer standing along the side of the road . The noise causes them to stop and look . Highly recommend .
3 #### The case is durable , non - slip , and keeps the camera lens from resting on the table when the phone is face up . Unfortunately , the same non - slip feature that prevents the phone from sliding around also makes it a huge pain to get it in and out of your pockets . I ended up buying a leather pouch and using it instead .
5 #### if splitting an xlr signal ( mic or line ) is your goal and you want to do it cheaply and simply then this is perfect . there are expensive pro devices that will supposedly do this more properly and efficiently but unless you 're setting up a million dollar show or recording platinum albums this will do the trick just fine imo . note ; combining signals is a different matter all together . in that case you do want some sort of tranformer isolation device . for instance https://www.amazon.com/Whirlwind-IMCOML-IMP-Level-Combiner/dp/B0007CG5DM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1499831514&sr=8-2&keywords=whirlwind+line+combiner for line level signals . they also have amic level unit just like it . but for splitting , have no fear . your signal integrity will be fine and your devices will be safe . the 1.5 foot cable is very short but that is what I wanted . not something i need all the time but great to have in the tool chest for when I do . plan to get one more .
5 #### Fabulous ! Worth every penny ! I have my Blu - Ray , RUKO and Apple TV all connected and no loss of quality ! Excellent !
3 #### these were Christmas gifts for my daughters 6 and 8 . i have little experience with these they worked when i got them and you can not beat the price .
4 #### My particular 2006 F150 Super Crew XLT 5.4L truck requires the FG1083 , not the FG986B. The tubes are smaller diameter on this filter ( FG986B ) than the one needed for my truck . Apparently Ford was not consistent with the fuel lines and filter used during the 06 -07 time frame . The filter body is the same size . My inlet fuel line had a blue retainer clip . Reading in F150 forums there are orange clips on some trucks , maybe that is an easy tell tale sign of which filter to use on your vehicle . Blue = FG1083 , Orange = FG986B ? Amazon Customer Service was great to deal with on the return .
5 #### Fits like a normal filter . I 've used this brand of filters for 10 years now . I 've had great results . They have been a normal part in all of out cars .
5 #### This headset is so good I have bought one for me and two friends . Headset is comfortable and easy to use . Great for the price too .
5 #### This unti is used with my EF 100 mm Macro . Great lighting and also triggers my 430EXII used to back light the subject .
5 #### Works as it is a Monster cable and while this brand tends to get a negative light in some aspects ( think Beats By Dre headphones , a lot of people have them but even amateur experts stay clear ) but I 've actually had success using their XLR cords . This happens to be a good price point and I do n't see any loss in quality for the price I paid . Recommended .
5 #### Worked great . Must charge the compressor lines enough for the low limit switch to kick the compressor on if it 's low on 134a . Once the a / c compressor kicked on I ran the a / c for 15 minutes and drove around the block . I found that my compressor was leaking around the compressor shaft ( noticed red dye dripping on ground ) seal and replaced the compressor .
5 #### must warm up oil to be able to suction out easier . this makes an oil change so much easier . I recommend this product for any do - it yourselfer .
4 #### With the many types of FRS radios out there . You can expect the same range of receptions . You do not need the senseless features other radios have to offer . The Motorola FR 50 is all is needed . 14 Channels are plenty to move around if you feel you need privacy to chat with your parties . The down far of this radio like many others , it does not offer a rechargable battery and charging jack . You either buy alkines or a separate charging outlet and rechargable batteries .
3 #### I installed this in my SUV for use during my rides to work . You ca n't hold a phone while driving in Illinois anymore so I needed a good holder . I like everything about except for the button to press to make it expand . I will press it repeatedly and sometimes it does not move at all . Not sure if I got a lemon or if it is the way it works . Works well enough .
5 #### When your truck holds 42 gallons of gas and gets 10 - 12 MPG , you will need to change your filter a bit more often . I always keep one of these on hand . They could be boxed better , so if you order it with other heavy things , make sure it is n't damaged prior to install . Otherwise , if you order these by themselves , they ship just fine .
5 #### Great cleaner . Use it all the time to clean my K&N air filters on my 350z
4 #### I bought this primarily to use with Skype . It works mostly good , and it is b3etter than the H820 that I own . However , with Skype the quality drops a little bit . I am sort of satisfied with it , but I still get static sometimes . The Bluetooth connector that came with it will not connect . I had to buy a " cheap " bluetooth connector by Logitechg .
5 #### Exactly as described . The aerosol oil is so much easier to apply than the squeeze bottle . I 'll never go back .
5 #### Well , this is not a game . It is a cable assembly for the Wii game console . This review simply confirms that the cable works well with the Wii . I replaced the original composite video cable with this one and got 480p on my TV . A working non - OEM product at this price should be 5 - star .
5 #### The filter is re - cleanable with this kit . No point buying the filter if you plan to not buy the cleaning kit .
5 #### When I first started playing coated strings , it was because Elixirs were on a new guitar I 'd bought . After trying several other brands and thicknesses , I ended up going back to what the factory had selected , and that gave me the sound I liked so well when I bought the instrument in the first place . Then I bought another guitar from the same manufacturer , and it had EXPs on it . Sure enough , better , more natural sound . ( I 'd name the guitar maker , but this is about strings . ) Tried Cleartones on the instrument . No thanks . Took 'em right back off again , ( and not for the first time ; no Cleartones for me , thanks . ) The EXPs , though ... Top notch ! Now maybe they 'll make Custom Lights like Elixir does ? Having tried a LOT of strings over the past 40 years of playing , these are my favorite by far .
3 #### Not bad but field of vision is too small . Not auto focus . Get what you pay for .
5 #### This is simply put the best headphone that I 've ever own . I 've never heard anything that sound remotely as good as this headphone . I 'm hearing subtle sounds and beat from my music that I never heard before . And the price could n't be better and the cool packaging was a nice topping . My only regret is not knowing about this class of headphone sooner .
5 #### It takes a very , very long time to cure . Several days . But once it has cured it is exceptionally strong and watertight .
5 #### This is a must have if you are working on a car . If you own a car this should be your first investment whether you are going to work on it or not .
5 #### Fit perfectly on my 1999 Jeep TJ and the slot on the bottom is the perfect size to fit mine and my wife 's cell phone ! ! !
5 #### Works very well at both cleaning stubborn scuffs and at protecting . This does not leave a shiny finish , but a more realistic , matt finish .
5 #### Absolutely , without a single doubt , the single best personal audio purchase I have ever made . Give them a steady , moderate usage , 2 weeks to break in , and you will NOT EVER regret buying these .
5 #### The Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner far exceeded my expections and I will be ordering more of them from you soon . I highly recommend this seller and this product .
3 #### this is ok for sprayin primer or paint but i do n't find great for clear coat . it create bubbles in the clear . i am not a professional and it maybe i need to adjust gun properly but i was n't impress with the job it did on clear coat .
5 #### So good I had to get another one for my other vehicle !
5 #### I use this cord in my church to run from my pedalboard to my amp ( which is in a soundproof box ) . The cord is reliable and clean sounding . I like it and have used HOSA products in the past with confidence . Excellent cord . Hopefully this review will be usefull to you .
4 #### I 've had mine a little over a year now and it 's the best I 've found . I actually had to turn down the sound it is so loud . I love that you can shut it on or off by folding the boom . You can even buy a case for it that you can clip on your belt . Whenever I get tired of wearing it I just fold the boom and place it in the case on my belt . Great bluetooth Motorola ! !
4 #### I have bought many of these phones and they can not be beat for durability . The sound quality provides a nice balance between bass and treble . I have rarely had a wire failure even though I wear the phones in many different situations . I have had the plastic band break while laying on my side in bed so that the earpiece comes free . I simply duct tape the earpiece to the band so that it ca n't move but still fits my head and carry on . Wish these phones were foldable so that they would be more comfortable for a side napper .
5 #### The strings sound beautiful i have an estaban guitar known for its cheep wood and horrible sound and the strings sound wonderful on my guitar .
1 #### Plugged it in and my computer says that it is corrupted and wo n't recognize it . Waste of my money !
3 #### Bought these for Christmas , they do n't fit to head very well and tend to snap off if bumped . These are very light weight . They are still working though .
5 #### This a GREAT ! ! My old one is over 15 years old and decided to purchase a new for another car . You CAN"T beat this duster for your car or even in your home ! !
5 #### This was the first time trying Elixir strings as well as any coated strings on my acoustic guitar . Unfortunately , the top E string snapped at the head when I was tightening it for the first time but that may have been because I installed it wrong . For the first few days these sounded too bright and twangy but after a week or two it mellowed up and sound great now . I 've had no problem with them going out of tune either . The coated strings are smooth and very comfortable when sliding . I expect them to last a long time .
5 #### Looking for something to dry your car off and leave NO steaks ? This is it . I will only put this on my car after i give it a nice bath . Will not scratch your paint , even if it 's new . This universal towel is excellent just to have . Even if you have pets you can use this to speed up the drying process . Excellent product here !
5 #### Monster Cable now makes a line of quality power strips that both protect your electronic components from dangerous power surges but also provide line noise - free filtering to enhance your audio / visual experience . MP HT800 is the one I chose from this line . I like the many features of this surge protector , such as the color - coded outlets that make it a breeze to recognize the purpose of individual outlets . The outlets come pre- labeled for your components , and matching cord labels are provided for easy and logical hookup . I like the fact that the Monster Cable HT800 comes with a 8 ft . long AC power cable . So many surge protectors use only 6 foot or shorter power cables . So , this provides ample length for most hook - ups . Another great feature of the power cable is that it has a flat profile plug that is set at a right angle to provide greater flexibility for installations and allows furniture to hug the walls . The power surge protector itself has 8 outlets total , including 3 which are spaced for use with AC adapter transformers . Try to match that with generic power surge protectors ! Another quality feature is that all the contacts are 24k gold to allow maximum conductivity . There 's a lot to like in this Home Theater power surge protector and not much if anything to dislike . I would recommend this to anyone wanting a better quality surge protector for their A / V system . I hope this helps .
5 #### These strings have a beautiful warm sound . The coating makes them last longer in between sets
1 #### If I had n't brought this for the discount price I did , it would be returned . People I talk to have trouble hearing me , they say I sound like I 'm in a cave . Sometimes I have trouble hearing them . The ear loop does n't work very well if you like an ear loop . I am now looking for another BT headset . I had high hopes for this Jawbone .
5 #### Just beginning to learn guitar - the strings are very easy on the fingers !
5 #### I bought this when I was doing sound for a party where we had acoustic musicians that wanted to be mic'd . It really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin .. I will be buying more of these !
5 #### Expensive but awesome , especially the tire cleaner . I especially like that it is not corrosive and yet cleans far better than any tire cleaner I 've tried off the shelf . Overall this is a veyr high quality product but I guess you get what you pay for .
3 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . . . stabilizer the hitch to the receiver . Thought it was pricey as it 's basically a " U " bolt , a plate , 2 nuts , and 2 washers .
5 #### I was a little skeptical first , Light gauge are not really durable I thought , but those are great strings . I have this set of strings on my LP for 2 month now , play for about 2 hours daily and mainly blues ...
5 #### Works great and very satisfied with this purchase . Wish the cord was longer , but glad many put in tips on how to extend it in other areas of the review . I have n't looked into buying the equipment to extend it but hoping to soon . Other than that it works perfectly with what I need it for at the moment . I had looked at other remotes , like the wireless ones but the amount of complaints on those made me decide on this one . I d advise this one than the cheaper ones that are not canon or the wireless ones that are iffy on if it will work . Especially when your doing outdoor photography .
3 #### I bought these to give my guitar a cleaning . It was very dusty and had grime on the fretboard . The set cleaned my guitar fairly well but the thing I do n't like about it is the wax because it leaves white particles all over my guitar and attracts more dust . It 's a bit expensive too .
5 #### I wanted to play my phone through my large stereo unit . This works perfectly , is long enough for most purposes and has no hum or buzzing . I have n't had a bad Belkin product yet so if you want a mini splitter , do n't waste your money on more expensive versions . This is perfect .
4 #### Drum sticks for an electronic drum set . Not sure I can tell a difference with regular sticks , but these are good .
5 #### The string winder is very good and was fairly priced . I 'd do business with this seller again .
2 #### Did n't work for me . I had a dealer label on the back of my truck that fell off . I tried this product using all the methods described to no avail . I had to use a heat shrink gun to remove the adhesive and that was even a hard job .
5 #### Arrived in great condition , not cracked or anything . You get exactly what you expect : dark rosin . Works well on my viola and violin .
5 #### I am not the best person to review guitar strings since I am primarily a Bass player but I use Ernie Ball Bass strings on some of my Basses & my Guitar Tech recommended ; depending on the guitar I will use 10s or 11s ; On semi hollow & hollowbody guitars I have tried some other brands but most of my solid body guitars have these Ernie Ball Regular Slinky 10s . You ca n't go wrong if you listen to your Guitar Tech ; ( assuming you have a good one )
4 #### Fine strings but they do n't last as long as Elixir 's Nanoweb guitar strings . Do n't know why .
5 #### Very comfortable and this is what it is all about .
2 #### I bought this along with my Canon XS as part of a packaged deal in 2008 . I have used this lense about 4 times . I like the reach but that 's about it . Sorry but this lense just does n't do it for me as the focus is slow and the images are just not sharp . Honestly if you want something I would suggest the 70 - 300 usm or even the 70 - 200 f/4 L. The build quality on this lense is cheap . The focus ring is small ( obviously most of the users will be using autofocus anyways ) . The filter does move whenever you focus ( not good ) . There is no image stabilization either . I would n't recommend this lense unless it was pretty much free .
5 #### This stuff really makes your tires look new again . Not glossy which I like . Just spray on , wipe in and let dry
5 #### These are very nice , we have had them for a while now , and they are still on good shape . Worth the price .
1 #### I am older and I bought this harness to take the weight of the tenor sax off of my neck . I am of fairly average size for an adult male , 5'10 ' tall , 160 lbs . , and I can not adjust this harness to feel comfortable ---the side straps cut into my lats . The harness is also difficult to adjust to have the mouthpiece come up to my mouth ; instead I end up getting it sort of close to where I want the mouthpiece to be , and then bend my neck to bring my mouth down to the mouthpiece ( and this is not how you want to play the sax ) . I should have returned this product , but I tried to make it work . The basic Neotech 1901162 for about $ 11 to $ 16 is better , but be careful selecting the size . For tenor sax players you are likely to need the X - Long , which really is n't very long . The " regular " , is just a little too short for tenor ----Neotech could have easily added a few inches of material to the " regular " size and it would have worked for most people for both alto and tenor sax .
5 #### Added this to my clutch slave that I have kept replacing every six months before it starts leaking . It sealed the leak and gave me back pressure almost instantly . This fluid is a red sticky syrup like additive . I actually found it half the price listed here at my local Mills Fleet Farm . If you live in WI or MN check there before paying twice as much . So far I am very impressed with this product .
1 #### I used this for 3 months before upgrading to Windows 7 . Do n't know if the upgrade had an effect , but the router never worked well after that . I spent about 8 hours with Linksys and they wound up blaming AT&T. Spent more hours with AT&T who were quick to blame Linksys . Dead end here and no guarantee . I wound up buying an AT&T modem / router which installed easily and works fine so far . Beware using this router if you have AT&T DSL .
4 #### I am buying the Rebel T4i with the default 18 - 55 lens . I am looking for an additional lens for a bit longer range . I am leaning towards this model but also came across this one " Canon EF - S 55 - 250 mm f/4.0 - 5.6 IS II Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras " Could someone please illustrate the differences between these models ?
5 #### These are excellent . I 'm not 100 % sure if this is true bit it seemed to me that warmed up quiet a bit after playing them for a few days . At first I did n't like them but 3 days later they mellowed out . I tried medium - lights on my Taylor GS mini but I had a bit of buzz and I did n't want to try and have it setup differently yet so I went back to these which are what came on the guitar .
5 #### I installed these on my 01 f250 after my factory ones locked up and after one shot off the truck doing 70 mph ( not in 4x4 ) . Although the instructions are a little confusing and there is extra parts for other models of trucks it was relatively simple . It 's must stronger and better set up than factory by far . Already used them in the snow here and man they worked great in the icy conditions
5 #### Just as described , my son was very happy with this product when he opened the package . Well worth the money .
4 #### I like the Daddario strings but I thought I would give these a try again on my Martin guitar . They sound nice but not quite as nice in my opinion as what I am used to using .
4 #### Fits just fine in the dash of my ' 02 Chevy Cavalier . The plastic appears to be good quality , and it matches the interior well . I really like the texture on the front part of the radio insert , as well as the storage compartment under the radio . The only flaw I have found is that the contents of the under radio storage compartment will fly out sometimes . It seems to need some kind of no - stick pad in there . Also the instructions are pretty hard to follow , at least for my Cavalier . Had to spend some time just trying to figure out how it goes together , its easy once you take a minute to figure it out .
1 #### Did not work at all just made everything greesy and after a day it collects dust like crazy , , package was a mess lids were all off cans , do not buy this product from this seller
5 #### The batteries were the best price I could find and no shipping . I definitely use this Seller again and would recommend that anyone needing photo supplies or batteries check them out
5 #### I learned to play a little guitar as a kid ( I had 3 brothers who played ) but I had n't picked one up in over 40 yr.s . When my wife offered to get me one for Christmas , I did n't want to spend too much money so we decided on the Epiphone DR100 . It came packed in a box inside of another box and it came out without a mark and the finish was amazing . It took a few days for the strings to stretch but then it held its tune very well . Make no mistake this is n't a Martin or Gibson but this particular guitar sounds better than any " cheap " guitar I 've heard . The ends of the Frets are not finished well ( a bit sharp),but I can clean that up when I do my first string change . I 've had it a little over 2 mo.s now and I found out relearning in your 60 's is a lot harder than learning was at 12 or 13 but it is worth it just to hear that clear crisp ring of a g or c cord player on this guitar , This is a great guitar for a beginner or an old man starting over . My wife loves the sound and I smile every tine I pick it up .
5 #### Exactly as I expected and got excellent service . Arrived quicker than expected . Love the vivid color . Will shop again Thank you .
5 #### Overall I like this jug . I bought this so that I would be able to accurately mix 50:50 coolant . It is easy to pour .
5 #### I recently purchased an ESP LTD guitar that came stock with a JB in the bridge and I absolutely love the tone . It 's bright and aggressive , perfect for hard rock and metal . I particularly like bright tones so this works very well for me . I will say that the output is a bit much for cleans ( gives it a compressed , slightly muddy tone ) , but it works great running into moderate or heavy gain .
1 #### I 've replaced this item long ago , surprisingly with another Jawbone product that works well . Hopefully , you will not find this original vintage anymore .
5 #### I bought this package even though I did n't need some of the items packaged in the bundle -- though I guess it does n't hurt to have an extra travel charger lying around . For about $ 12 after shipping , this is one heck of a deal . Any one of these items would cost you more from Samsung than the entire package , which makes it a solid buy for Eternity owners . The main items I wanted were the USB cable and car charger , but the silicone phone cover fit well enough that I use it as well . I would prefer it if the package came with a hard case instead a silicone one , however .
5 #### This external battery is perfect ! Exactly what I was looking for . I love my IMP1000 ( old 2010 model of the newer IMP120D) ... but I found myself not bringing it with me as often as I 'd like due to it 's larger size . I 've only had this for a short while , so I 'll update my review when I 've had more time with it . So far , first impressions are : * PROS * - Small , compact , and lightweight . Perfect for travel and everyday use . - Feels extremely well - made . Durable . I really like the weight . It 's not too heavy , but you can tell it 's great quality . - Lasts a long time . Can easily keep my iPhone 5 juiced up when traveling home during the week . - Handy laser pointer and flashlight . Though not necessary , it 's a nice add - on . - This is a big one . The charging cable is the SAME cable to charge both the device itself , as well as charge my other devices . No more AC wall adapter . Ca n't stress enough how great it is to only carry one cable . - Carry - case included . Awesome ! * CONS * - Probably have n't had the iTorch long enough ... but so far , no complaints !
5 #### Bought this around 4 years ago but writing this now . Still works and has had no problem with my car ( mitsubishi eclipse 2004 ) . Works as expected .
3 #### This headset is fine - not great but great for the price . It works well for listening to music or other audio , and also functions as a hands free headset for phone calls . The control bud ( small box between the ear buds and the end that plugs into the phone ) contains a microphone and a switch for answering and ending calls . This switch has limited functionality while listening to music . The weirdest thing is that the left ear but wire is so short - as other reviewers have noted . This leaves the ` control ' bud ( the thing with the button and the microphone ) hanging at your jaw level . Maybe that 's the new style in Korea or something . Sound is not premium , but as I mentioned before - you ca n't beat the price . I would probably look at some of the other headsets out there next time as I do n't like the control bud hanging next to my jaw .
4 #### Not magic , but helpful . My engine seemed to run noticeably smoother after adding SeaFoam
4 #### It does what it 's supposed to do , connects the network for my xbox well . Works well with a home networking system .
5 #### I bought this item reading reviews of customers and I am very happy with the quality of it . It is on line with expectations .
5 #### Nice cover that stays put does n't slip or slide . Feels great on your hands , easy to install .
4 #### This is my third pack ; the 1st pack has been using for two months , the sounds are rich and full , and the feels are still good . I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing , and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time . So , I want to keep a completed pack for back up . I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently , sometime , i will practice for 4 - 5 hours+ until i 'm tired for the session . I have used light steel strings on my acoustic , but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter .
4 #### I needed some batteries for 3 different watches that ran out of batteries . Luckily they used the same type / size of battery ( I guess it 's quite common ) . I was concerned when I received them ( plain white envelope ) since the date printed on the back showed 2006 , but I was told that was the patent date - not the manufacture date . Kudos to the shipper for responding quickly . I proceeded to replace batteries in watches , and they 're all working fine .
4 #### The battery life is great and it fits my ear very well . I 've found with other units that it can be uncomfortable to wear on my ear for any length of time . This particular model has a very soft earpiece and fits me nicely . I can wear it for hours and not even know it 's there . It does n't cause any irritation at all . Reception is very good but like the other brands you ca n't stray far from your actual phone or youw ill drop the call .
5 #### I bought this as a replacement for the one I lost . It 's used daily and lasts a few days without charging . It works perfectly !
5 #### These are quality reeds and at a great price . Music stores charge significantly more . Also , shipping is quite fast which is great for the times your son says , " Oh , I need some more reeds . I 'm on my last one . "
5 #### Multi - tool for any bass player , cuts strings , winds them and has a puller for some bridges with plugs . It 's practical and it works !
4 #### Overall very pleased with the product . The phones are lightweight , comfortable , and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house & yard . The quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good . There is an ample supply of cables & adapters , i.e. , for plugging into a computer soundcard .
5 #### This is an excellent deal if you have room to Keep it far cheaper than buying from auto store . i would recommend buying one Kit from the auto store so you can use these to refill the smaller bottles it makes it easier .
5 #### works great , will buy more , great high voltage quick disconnect you can buy , very easy to install and use
5 #### Second one I have and it works well . Keep one in a bag and one in the shop / garage .
5 #### This has to be the easiest piece of hardware I ever set up . Out of the box , plug it in , plug your cables in and you 're running . Less than 10 minutes and I was sharing my internet connection on two computers . Would n't have even taken that long if I did n't go through the motions of configuration to make sure everything was set up correctly . For people who know what they are doing , geekwise , it makes life easy . For people who know nothing or little , it 's even simpler .
5 #### Got these to attach a laser projector system to a t - bar type lighting rig . Works perfect , easy to use , holds my expensive laser well enough for me not to sweat about it !
5 #### This is one of those things you never think you need until you have had it . I finally bit the bullet and bought it and I was amazed at how much quieter it made my Lexus .
4 #### This dampening pad has a nice , simple , functional design . The velcro pads work well and it 's cool that you can choose the larger or smaller end of the pad to dampen your head . Just looking at the product photo I thought it would be made from thicker , heavier material , but it 's actually lighter than a pillow . I was skeptical of its abilities at first because of this , but then I tried it out and it works very well .
3 #### The locking device is rather quirky . sometimes it works well other times I have to keep pushing the button just to get the arms to move a little . Not very well made .
5 #### This is like the older Original Sport Grip used as a steering wheel cover . It looks like the company , Superior , has changed the labeling on the various package sizes . It was impossible to tell which size I needed from the description or viewing the package , so here is the proper sizing chart : " 500 " Sport Grip is now the Sport Grip , size " A " and fits a circumference up to 3 1/8 " Super Sport Grip is now the Sport Grip , size " B " and fits a circumference up to 3 3/8 " Superwide Sport Grip is now the Sport Grip , size " C " and fits a circumference up to 3 7/8 " All Sport Grips fit steering wheel diameters of 14.5 to 15.5 " Most newer cars have a large circumference and will need a " C " size . I could have used a " D " size , if they would have made it . All are made in China . It appears that the " holes " spacing is a little further apart so the spacing or width of the laces is a little more than the ones I used years ago . Still a decent product that covers the steering wheel nicely .
4 #### Was impressed with the clarity of the optics . I keep them in the glove box so I gave them handy
5 #### This backup light kit ( 517 ) from KC Hilites has everything you need . The wires are plenty long enough for an install on a full size Nissan Titan pickup . The plastic wire loom included in the kit ( to keep the wire from rubbing against the frame / body ) was also plenty long . In fact it was longer than the wire and I had to cut it to length . The relay included in the kit allows you to tap into the wire going to the OEM backup lights without drawing power from those lights for the new backup lights . KC Hilites also produces a switch kit ( 6303 sold separately ) that connects into the relay and allows you to turn on the backup lights without putting the vehicle into reverse . As noted in other reviews the description for this item is wrong on a number of accounts . Only one set of lenses is included , not three . These are the clear , long range lenses , not the fog or amber lenses . The illuminated switch is not included - that is item 6303 from KC Hilites . Light covers are also not included . The All Season version of this kit ( 516 ) does come with the extra lenses , switch and covers . Of course that kit is more expensive .
5 #### For the safety minded people this is a must have . Hand free is the best policy to take in todays times .
4 #### These are really handy so your boards do n't push back when you try to take your motorcycle / wheeler / whatever off your truck . Seem pretty sturdy and come with all the mounting hardware . You just need a drill and socket to put the bolts through your 2x8 board .
4 #### I bought this to charge a vehicle stored outdoor with an extension cable 25 ' from Schumacher that Amazon suggested . as frequently bought together .. BUT the charger does n't have a connector for the extension cord , just the hardwire terminals . Also the owners manual says do not expose to rain- hard to thing of a rainier environment than a vehicle driving at highway speeds in the rain and this is supposed to be mounted under the hood , not totally out of the weather by any means . So I decided to put it on my tractor in the barn and get an indooor charger from Schmacher for the outdoor vehicles
5 #### This is a great little stand for your acoustic guitar . It has a small footprint , but provides a nice , stable place to rest your instrument . It folds up into a small package that is lightweight and very portable . The contact points are foam covered to prevent scratching . Glad I purchased it !
1 #### At first I really liked this cable . Coils well , does n't tangle , solid connection . After a couple months of regular use ( I play shows & rehearsals every week ) , it died without warning in the middle of a show . In fact , it died just after the return window closed with Amazon , so I contacted Planet Waves about their lifetime warranty . I was notified I 'd have to ship it to them at my expense in order to get a replacement . Being that it would cost nearly as much to ship it as I 'd paid in the first place , I decided to take the loss and move on . I 've had good results using other Planet Waves products , but I wo n't be purchasing any more of their cables . Totally unreliable .
5 #### Has an aggressive tone for just a overdrive pedal . More bite than creamy . I use it with my 50w plexi and it kills when the amp is turned up and wide open . This pedal is a keeper
5 #### Excellent price value for a battery that has significant power for turning over a high compression engine . Received battery with no voltage even though the instructions says that all batteries are charged . Placed it on an Optimate charger and it charged very quickly and has been operating flawlessly ever since .. . .
5 #### Working for over a year with nary a reboot required . 5/5 would buy again .
5 #### the protector hard case , fit just right , I have acces to all my buttons in my iphone 4s , Have not had any issues with it .
5 #### I had n't worked on old vehicles for a while so this was helpful . The price was right and it gave me the basics to do a $ 600 repair job for $ 50 .
4 #### Good strings , good tone but not quite the sound I 'm looking for . They lost their initial sparkle within a couple of weeks .
5 #### I 've always preferred behind the neck headphones and have been willing to sacrifice a little sound quality for smaller headphones . With these , there is no trade off . They sound great with excellent response and rich bass that is n't overbearing . They weigh almost nothing and are very comfortable on my somewhat oversized head . As for looks and styling .. they sound great ! Then again , if your headphone purchase is based on " fashion " , the help you desperately need wo n't be found in product reviews .
5 #### I did n't liek the fact that everything in the Operating system ( Android 2.2 ) is connected to AT&T. In order to listen to the radio you need an AT&T account . I do n't know how to erase AT&T from the cellphone . Some people told me to reinstall the operating system , but I was told that I was going to need an aunlock code from AT&T ... So if you are not going to use this cellphone with AT&T it is better not to buy it ... that 's what I think . Sorry . The cellphone works very well . It flips the beybeard very well . The keys have a nice feeling in your fingers when you use them . If you use the touch QWERTY keyboard it is easy too . The cellphone works very well with Social networks , WIFI , etc .
3 #### Over priced and the signal loss and picture quaility is no better then when using the low cost units . Save your money .
5 #### This cable works flawlessly , plus the price is really low . I ca n't think of anything which could be improved . Recommend !
5 #### I am a professional mariner , and these are abused . They see temp changes from equatorial to artic cold regularly . never fog up . NEVER . After owning these binocs for close to 30 years , yes 30 years , the eye adjustment began to slip a bit . Not a big deal , but I need these to be perfect . I sent them in for repair , and they just sent me back a new set , complete with case and straps . In this day and age of throw away crap , Burris / Steiner are the real deal . What wonderful level of commitment to product quality and customer service . Hard to find that these days . Did I pay a bit more many years back ? Yes . And the real payoff was today . Good for another 30 years . Buy once - buy well - be happy .
5 #### I have not used this one yet , but it has 3 brush heads , while cheaper cleaner disc 's typically have only 1 . Should do a good job cleaning .
4 #### I use them and I like them ... though since they seem to be made from painted carbon steel do not let them stand in the garage floor over winter . They will most likely begin to rust . I sprayed a bit of rubberized undercoating on them to at least prevent rust for a while
1 #### It 's cute but no protection at all . Broke my holster to my outterbox , so I thought I 'd switch up and just when I did , my phone broke away fell and my screen cracked ..... no good
5 #### I 've owned my Razr2 for almost two years and I love it . Now that it 's time to get a new phone , I 've been looking around to see what replacements there are for my Razr , and frankly , there 's nothing out there that I think is better . This phone is very well designed and it 's easily my favorite cell phone ever . No , it is not a ' smart phone ' or Blackberry , but it 's slick , plays music , is easy to text on , easy to play games on , and has an SDHC mini expansion port . The screen is very nice and has reasonably good resolution . The camera takes decent photos , especially considering this design is over 2 years old . I 'm still not sure what I 'm going to replace it with once mine breaks ; there does n't seem to be another flip phone out there that is as sleek and nicely designed as this one .
5 #### Very helpful to keep your strings clean and responsive . The strings stay smooth without residue buildup preserving their tone and life . An added benefit is that the lubricant keeps your finger callouses softer .
5 #### Good product , works well , no complaint at all . I would recommend it if you are looking for an HP usb drive
5 #### OK , so no one will mistake the photos for professional ones , but these disposable cameras are great ! I take one with me when I go to raves , 'cause I do n't want to lose my more expensive camera . Photo quality is quite reasonable . The camera is loaded with fast film , so it works in all light conditions with help from the flash . Might as well activate the flash for every picture , since it makes outdoor pictures look better , too . Plus , when you consider you 're throwing away the camera , there 's no point in trying to save battery power .
5 #### This is one of the best cases I have used on my Verizon iPhone 4 . It is light , has a great grip , looks excellent and everything on the phone is easily accessible . The best part of this case is definitely the felt lining which protects the back of the iphone from scratches and also the holes design on the sides which basically looks nice and reduces excess weight . The lip of the case is also slightly raised to create a lay on the table design . This is a great case if you 're looking for medium protection and want to solve the antenna issue . I recommend it for people like myself who are looking to prevent the phone from being scratched and want decent grip . This obviously is not the case for you if you constantly are dropping the phone . I have dropped my phone once from about 3 feet high on concrete with this case on , and the phone came away perfect . The case just has a scratch on it now .
5 #### Netgear does it again . This is a perfect little switch in a lot of ways . Pros : -5 ports , all are 10/100 , all have appropriate status lights -Durable metal construction -Wall mount option included ( switch has holes on the back , and screws are included ) -The power cable even has a nice long cord Cons : -None . So long as you understand what you 're getting , you ca n't ask for anything better . This unit has a quality build , and is worth investing a few dollars more than the competition for build quality and features .
4 #### I ordered these because I bought a variety pack of picks from Musician 's Friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack . I loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought , so I went on the hunt for very thin picks . The celluloid one fell apart quickly , so I wanted a better material . These white nylon picks should last a lot longer . The non - pointed end is all grippy ( textured ) , so it does n't work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick , but it does the job and I like it . The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely , but you can still pick with it if you 're combining picking and strumming . I 'll keep using thicker picks for picking - only songs and for louder strumming , but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house , these are great . UPDATE : I 've been using them for more than a year now , and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostly - strumming song ... but you can do it . This is still my favorite pick for strumming . Hope this helps .
5 #### I used to use the Elixier nanoweb , but the nano part would peel off the strings like dried glue from the palms of your hands . The polyweb does n't have this problem . Some people complain that the coating dulls the sound of the strings , but I really like the tone . I have used these for years , and in fact , they 're the only strings I like at all anymore .
3 #### This product does clean fingerprints and stains succesfully but do n't expect much from the very fragile plastic device since it starts cracking and getting loose very soon . Not for removing heavy stains or scratches .
5 #### This set is great for drop D and Slack Key tunings . I hate string squeak and the NANOWEB coating is very helpful in reducing squeak on the wound strings .
4 #### This is the only kit that our local electronics store carried so we gave it a try . I mounted the reciever antenna in my attic , and used the 30 foot cable to the gain adjuster box , and to the black antenna . It actually did work pretty well , when you were within 5 feet of the black antenna , then signal dropped off . It boosted my phone by 2 - 3 bars . I guess that s why they call it a desk top booster , that s the only place it will boost your signal . The local store was charging $ 299 for the kit , so we promptly returned it the next day , and will spend just a little more right here on Amazon and get a much better kit with a wideband antenna mounted outside on the roof , and better booster for inside the house . It was nice to figure out the Wilson kits will work for us though .
5 #### This is better than all those rubber cases . It wo n't slip off and it stays looking clean . This is a great buy .
5 #### I have a small 6 gallon 3 tier fountain on the back patio . This pump is so dependable , I 've had it working for years and it just keeps on going . I bought a spare just in case the first one quits . It is dependable , reliable , and the price is great . Be sure you are on a GFI circuit because this pump is 110v . - Have fun !
5 #### I 've tried every guitar pick out there and these are THE BEST ! They stick to your fingers like nothing else , so you do n't have to keep re - gripping . High quality picks in a class all their own . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### I have both the BOSS DS- ! and this . Forget what some people saying about this being crappy and to much gain . This pedal is great and you can get tons of great tones from a good Metallica , Black Veil Brides , Megadeth , Avenged Sevenfold tone , and several others . Just do n't crank up that distortion to full blast and you will be good .
5 #### CHEAPEST PRICE ON THE NET . uhaul was twice the price ,
5 #### This FJC 9140 Stop Leak worked for me . No more adding 134a three times a year .
5 #### This glass blues bottle slide sounds great on the strings . Also the smaller neck on the bottle fits right above it the second knuckle right where I like it . Other tube shaped slides are too bulky and moves around on my finger which make it harder to remove during a performance . These are nice slides for this price .
5 #### The Raytek MT4 Mini Temp Non - Contact Thermometer Gun with Laser Sighting is the handiest infrared thermometer we have found . After trying several other brands over the past few years , we have found the Raytek to provide results closest to insertion thermometers . We primarily use three of these in our candle making business , but also have two for around the house and in the kitchen ( including a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mini - Temp - Non - Contact - Thermometer - Gun - RAYMT2 / dp / B000XW5T38 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mini Temp Non Contact Thermometer Gun ( RAYMT2)</a > ) . Here are my observations : * Easy to use and aim with laser targeting ( literally point and click ) * Solid design takes a good bit abuse * Very accurate but takes surface temperature , so liquids should be stirred before reading Highly recommended !
4 #### Its just as sparkly as I assumed it would be . However 3 of the rhinestones were missing before I removed it from the packaging . After using it for 4 days I noticed where the openings(for my cell ports ) the rhinestone would shift out of place . I super glued them back - for what I paid $ 1.06(i think)then 4.99 for shipping(yeah ) it is n't a bad product .
4 #### I usually play bronze strings , but wanted to try something different . These have good clear tone and I am very pleased . Also , really easy on fingers in the light gauge .
3 #### This item works as advertised , but does not provide high - quality or clear audio . I tested it at an electrical outlet not surrounded by electronic equipment . It put out a lot of static . I installed it at an electrical outlet next to a power strip operating electronic equipment and got the same high level of static . Pros : It installs easily and provides an extra phone jack at the location where it plugs into an existing phone jack . This let me continue to use my landline phone . I did not expect this extra phone jack . Con : The audio quality of the telephone line that plugs into the remote receiver is poor . I will keep the unit because it provides an adequate signal for interaction between my receiver and my satellite provider . Otherwise I would return it .
4 #### I needed this cable 4 - pin to 4 - pin to get Hi-8 digital video from a Sony camera uploaded to an XP laptop I have ( my work laptop , actually ) . Since Sony chose not to write the drivers necessary to accomplish this with Vista 64 , I needed to buy this cable . Sony , customer - friendly fellas that they are , wanted to charge me $ 39.99 for the cable and said they could n't get it to me for a couple of weeks . I do n't remember what I spent on the Belkin cable , but it was n't much north of ten bucks and it got to me two days later . And it works . But I wo n't be buying any Sony products any time soon .
1 #### This product did not fit my needs for use with motorola walkie talkie .
5 #### I paid like $ 70 for these . I should have bought a few but I did n't know they price would jump so high . I paid less than half of what they are currently going for on Amazon . They just happen to have a frequency response that my meditation CDs require . So , I bought them for that purpose . They do a great job and they 're also high quality headphones . What more could I ask for ?
5 #### use this in the car and on my leather shoes and boots . Does a great job .
2 #### the clearance between the tools is to tight and I would not allow me to turn strut nut until I ground strut holding tool down . It did accomplish the job for not much money . you get what you pay for .
4 #### This mount works really well once you get it up and going . Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot . But that 's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV 's and their mounting hole locations .
5 #### Heavy duty , works for me hope it last a few years
5 #### I use these on my student violins , upgrading from the stock string because they sound very nice and last so much longer . They seem to stay in tune once broken in as well .
5 #### GOOD STUFF , makes it look like you just handwaxed your car ( but you did n't then you use wax and it looks better ) Do n't let this sit too long , its hard to get off ...
5 #### This strap looks great and appears to be of very good quality . We are using it on my daughter 's acoustic guitar without strap locks and it seems to be holding very well .
5 #### I had the acoustic version of this stand already and needed one for an electric . Pretty simple design , easy to use and portable .
5 #### Part arrived on time . I have done this replacement before , several times , so that was pretty straight forward . Took about an 1/2 hour .
5 #### I was build a solar panel kit . This is my first attend and turn out work out prefect as i expected
1 #### This product is junk . Had it less than a month and it stopped working . Do nt waste your money .
4 #### Works perfectly as described . The directions were very clear , the functions were easily explained and implemented . My only wish is that it had a longer cord - but it 's a fantastic remote switch if your standing behind or next to your camera .
5 #### I 've used this on a variety of 6 strings and a few 12 strings and it really does give a good sound for the price . And if you 've got a variety of acoustics and do n't want to get pickups installed in ALL if them this is a great solution . It tends to work slightly better for finger picking than strumming because occasionally your hand will hit the chord coming out if you 're not careful . Remember that it must be used with a preamp and hopefully something ( most likely a tuner ) with stomp on / off bypass so that you can turn it off more easily .
1 #### Horrible quality . Direction stickers were marked on the wrong sides . Holes were punched but not detached . Better to spend the money somewhere else .
4 #### WOW , these headphones are incredible . My Sony MDR-7056 's were getting long in the tooth and really starting to fall apart , so i decided to indulge a little and get these headphones because I 've heard great things about these headphones through the web and word of mouth . Sound Quality did not disappoint . The open back experience is phenomenal and really heightens your listening experience beyond anything a pair of traditional closed back headphones or ear buds can deliver . My only qualm with the headphones are the cables . I wish there was more flexibility and ability for adjustment , because the split between left and right happens too quickly . however , the overall experience relative to price can not be matched . highly recommended .
5 #### clear as a bell very good quality for the price i guess the reviews were right about this microphone i have mines plugged up to the focusrite scarlett solo 2nd gen and it works pefectly
5 #### This Harmonica is an Instant classic Beautiful design , wood comb with a powerful and rich tone , high durable brass reeds and steel cover plates . Bends easily . One interesting fact is that instead of bolts it has nails on it , some people customize them and put bolts on them , but I honestly prefer nails . Faster and easier to open ( Just get a knife and carefully put it below the nails and push smoothly ( Adam Gussov has a Youtube video on it ) you do n't lose screws or anything and just push the cover plates with the nails and it is back on it . This way I feel the harmonica is more airtight . Rock , Country , Blues or Folk this is the harp needed for it !
5 #### This capo functions perfectly . It 's a nice , tight fit with no buzzing . I mainly use it for acoustic guitar , and with other capos I 've always had a problem with buzz . There 's some very good rubber padding to clamp down on the strings ; more padding than other , more chincy capos have . I also love this color . Pay the extra ten bucks for a good , solid capo .
5 #### This fuse holder is very heavy duty , and well made . It should work well in potentialy wet applications . You can choose the fuse size .
5 #### I purchased this for my T - Mobile Galaxy S2 . I messed up my last phone when it slipped out of my hand ! My phone immediately started doing weird things then eventually stopped working all together ! ! I decided I would by this to help protect my replacement phone in order to protect it from physical damage . I do n't know how much this case will protect from impact damage but it appears to be a wonderful addition towards my goal to protect the phone rather than not having one at all . I like the Matte finish on the back . It looks nice and it is tough to hurt it . If you have a T - Mobile Samsung Galaxy S2 , you would be happy with this product .
4 #### These are a good quality pair of jack stands , welds seem to be fine . The ratchet and backup pin are a bit of a pain , and It did not seem to go as high as I was hoping . I have a Class B + Motorhome 26 Foot and a sloping driveway , so I wanted to keep it level during winter storage . I 'm using these along with drive on ramps to do that . May use a 2x8 to get a couple more inches of lift by setting the base on the board . Seem to hold well .
5 #### Great strings , I love the sound that these strings give off . Good price . I bought these on Amazon because they were a little more expensive in store .
1 #### Please do not waste your money ti does n't worth it . I regretted ever buying this . It is very fake one !
4 #### This is a well made iPhone stand that holds my 6S at just the right angle . It 's described as being made of bamboo , but the box states the stand is actually Basswood / Walnut plywood , and that appears to be correct . The stand I received had a flat walnut finish and is very stiff and strong . Although the turned up lip is not very high , it actually does an excellent job of holding the phone . The packaging included ( 4 ) thin , clear [ possibly silicone ] rubber pads which should be installed to prevent the otherwise slippery wood stand from slipping . The walnut finish is attractive , and the current photos seen pretty accurate in showing the correct color and finish of the stand . The anti - radiation claim is obviously based on simply moving the phone away from one 's head . The wood stand does not appear to have any electromagnetic or electrostatic shielding of any type , and if it did would likely affect the phone operation in a negative way anyway .
3 #### I did a timing belt replacement on a 05 Acura TL . This tool does fit in the crank pully but its a bit loose so it moves slightly as you tighten down on the bolt . As a result of a stubborn bolt and a 4 foot cheater bar flexing too much I went the route of the bump start method which worked on the third try . This tool is needed when you re - install the bolt to the required torque .
5 #### Sexy red finish , spring loaded action , heavy steel and smooth rubber on the string side . I needed a delicate capo for my baby and this was perfect . It even matches my Guitars finish . I am very happy with my purchase
4 #### Very good headset . The first one was damage due to improper use . But this is a headset that we use everyday for work . 6 hours per day on average . Not perfect but very good and excellent range .
3 #### My iPhone cases have usually lasted for the life of the phone ( ~2 years ) , but this Incipio model broke after four months . Bottom edges can be sharp , not very rounded edges .
3 #### the string work well but did not give the mellow sound on my guitar that I was looking for . The shipping was quick and the strings were recieved in good order .
3 #### They do n't last very long buy hey , they were cheap .
2 #### I got these for the children . They say they 're very cheap and it 's hard to hear the sound .
5 #### Convenient , take my NEAT scanner with me everywhere and it 's protected in this case !
5 #### I purchased I used a little and worked good no complaint especially for this price .
5 #### Rain - X makes a very good product . Have driven in a heavy rainstorm without needing the wipers , but I run them anyway for safety .
4 #### Purchased this for a conversion on a motorcycle air ride system . Fittings worked great in tight places . Recommend this for your fitting needs .
4 #### Very sturdy and easy to set up . The flip mechanism is easy to use yet a little bit awkward for me to open . Fits both my Yamaha APXII and Silent guitar . Really glad I got this .
5 #### This is a excellent lens for my camera I do some wildlife photography and this brings the subject up close and personal . Rick
5 #### I love Elixir strings . I use them exclusively on all my electrics and acoustics . They have great tone with less finger noise . They also last much longer than noncoated strings .
5 #### Good buy for the money . I was tired of buying cheap crappy ones that always ended up breaking a seal or leaking . I bought this for the annual greasing of the snowblower and suspension components on my truck . Good quality , comes with both the flexible hose and solid extension .
4 #### for day todAy use with rough handling even when u keep I pocket which has keys you might end up getting scratches I would strongly recommend this if you are not worried of looks
2 #### The Hooks at the end are way to small and makes it impossible to use . Therefore i am not sure what to do with this spider web . Ant suggestions ?
4 #### I may have paid a little too much , but with work , it is hard to make it to the local music store . I like to keep a spare set a strings around .
5 #### Incipio never fails me , I love it . It 's a smooth design , my extension cord for my charger cord fits well in it . I have a pink one too . It 's cheaper than Verizon charging an arm and a leg for it .
2 #### This was really inexpensive , but it 's made of hard plastic , so if you drop your phone , the phone will likely be okay , but the frame with soon crack .
4 #### Bought it used . Auto focus servo is run down . New buyers should expect that to happen with heavy use . Lens is crystal clear and has nice depth of field . Great Buy .
5 #### I recommend this capo to all my friends since it is so easy to switch from one fret to another with it ! it holds the strings down well and enables me to transpose songs in a second ! I 've had the same capo for 8 years and it never failed me ! ( I use it around once or twice a day ) GO KYSER ! ! !
1 #### Spent three hours on the phone with Motorola to connect to their goofy " Motoblur " service they could n't get it to work and told me that the phone was defective . I returned it . If you order this phone you will probably receive the unit I returned . BE CAREFUL !
5 #### Great purchase for the money . Perfect length for the application I needed it for .
2 #### Did n't last very long . Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I should n't have expected it to last .
1 #### No good - they used to be of good quality- now they are not doing a good job- I am glad they are discontinued .
5 #### This is a " must have " for any K&N filter or CIA kit . I even use K&N 's kits for other " wet " air filters . If you want to getthe full life out of your K&N , this kit is a must - have . Remember to follow the instructions so as to not harm the filter element when cleaning . Cheers , Lance " Motorhead " Lambert [ ... ]
4 #### In my apartment I found myself in a rather awkward situation where I had to run cables all over the place . Having found this cordmate kit did the job . Taking this off was difficult , but I soon found using a hair dryer makes it come off easier . When you want to pull this off a wall use a hair dryer to heat the cordmate before and as you are removing it . There were still some black spots that stuck but not many .
5 #### As I 've gotten older and the arthriitis in my hands gets a little worse each year , I 've had to adjust my playing style and strings . I used to use medium gauge i.e. .012-.054 gauge , on my acoustic . Well , it 's gotten to the point that it 's just become too hard for me to use heavier gauge strings , so I thought I 'd try these . And I love 'em . They still sound great but they 're not as hard on my hands as the heavier gauge strings . The string gauges are .010 , .014 , .020 , .028 , .040 , & .050 . I still have the great Ernie Ball sound and chording is so much easier . As I will always say , BALLS ARE BEST ! ! !
5 #### Great price and fast shipping , item is exactly as described .
5 #### I used to cheap out on strings , but no more - consider me converted . These feel amazing , sound as good as anything I 've ever played on , and have lasted longer than expected .
5 #### I bought these based on good reviews like above . The treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm . Not tight and detailed based like from my Sennheiser 580 's but those cans cost ~$200 . Only issue I have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time . Eventually , they start falling out a lot . Nice sounding phones but wo n't take huge amounts of abuse .
5 #### They are well built and will last . Miidi cables do n't have to be fancy . Get the length that best reduces your cable clutter .
5 #### I switched from a Cobra 75 wx st to this radio . Night and day difference . Higher output , the noise reduction works great , and so does the adjustable RF gain . Should have bought this first . Bought it also because I had the same radio 20 + years ago . Still a great product .
5 #### These strings are great ; Brightest sounding coated strings I 've played so far ! They have great sustain , great depth with little streaking on the strings . I purchased the Elixir 80/20s for my 12 year old Toy 's r us First Act dreadnot guitar . I was setting up the guitar to sound better and also changed the tuning pegs and added bone abalone bridge pins for better clearer tone . This guitar went from a $ 100 sound , to a $ 600 sound over night ! Just incredible sound . I 've played Gibsons that down sound as clear and as bright . ( The first act has a vintage style X bracing . Non - scalloped Bracing . ) I put these elixirs 80/20s on my used Taylor gs mini(natural ) , and the Elixir PB on my Teton grand concert ( solid cedar top ) Also phenomenal tone . but then 1st string broke on both the Teton and the Taylor . So I got Martin SP lifespans(light ) for my Teton . Those strings are a better fit for mye teton .
5 #### got for my son 's jimmy because I broke his old one . it was old to start with . This fit great and was easy to install . He likes them better then old ones so ca nt ask for more .
5 #### This battery was a perfect replacement for my son 's F-150 . Half the price of one in the store and perfect performance . Shipped quickly too .
4 #### Overall I love this camera and would recommend it , especially considering the price you can get one for now . However , here are the cons : 1 ) Red - eye problems . Nearly every flash photo has red - eye . I have read that this is because the flash is too close to the lense . However , fixing red - eye on your computer is easy , so it 's a tolerable defect . 2 ) Although the camera body rotates , it 's not quite as user - friendly as the flip screen that rotates in any direction on the Canon G-2 . 3 ) Resolution . I always shoot on " fine " , but still end up with some photos that I 'm not crazy about the resolution . Pictures with lots of detail turn out great , but where there is less detail , you end up seeing the little dots . Although people say a 3.0 megapixel camera approaches film quality , I disagree . I see the pixelation even on 4X6 prints . Conclusion : I 'll continue to use ( and love ) my Nikon 990 until I save enough to replace with a 4 - 5 megapixel camera like the Canon G-3 or Nikon 5000 .
5 #### Great recharging product . I am very pleased with this charger and will simply summarize some of the other positive reviews . Small , includes charging cords . Will accept any USB based adaptor plug . Will charge both phones and tablets . It works with all 5 of the apple devices I use ( various ipods and iphones ) as well as Kindles ( Keyboard , touch and fire ) . Compact , does multiple recharges . Just an outstanding product .
5 #### They sound nice and have a good tension . However , they do n't last that long but I did n't expect them to anyway .
5 #### Yup ... They connect my cable modem to my router , and my router to my computers . They transmit data back and forth . So far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye . So go patch cables ( yay ) .
5 #### BEST STUFF TO DEADEN YOUR CAR ! VERY HAPPY WITH MY BASS
5 #### Excellent keyboard cover ! I like this one more than the others I own , as it is a nicer fit , heavier material , and it keeps the dust off my expensive keyboard better !
5 #### This is the best synthetic wax I have used to date . Apply using the Flintstones rule - A little dab'll do ya . Finish last for a long time - much longer than carnuba wax . I 've been using this product for about 5 years , and I still love it .
5 #### I ca n't think of an adequate superlative for this simple , little box . Setup ? Did n't even need stinkin ' instructions . Solved my problem by replacing a old piggybacked wireless router we were using for a switch . The switch is faster than the piggyback router ports . Never thought much of Netgear products , but this little box has surely changed my mind . If I had need for more ports , I 'd buy something bigger than the four - port switch . I 'm sold . You ca n't go wrong with Netgear .
2 #### I 've replaced this a few times from different sources and I do n't find these rings go on properly . I 've had others try as well and they could n't get it to fit right either .
5 #### Clear , acrylic night light . My cat and I think it is so pretty . The color of your wall will show thru , so does n't always have to be clear . My bathroom walls are white , so it casts a brighter light . It has a bit of weight to it , so it tends to slightly tilt forward in my wall outlet which being up near my medicine cabinet , I feared it would loosen and fall . But a tiny stretch of the prongs fixed the problem . I really like it a lot . Amazon has a great selection of night lights at especially good prices . Ca n't find them in stores , and pretty ones are very overpriced in gift shops .
5 #### What an I say , excellent strings when you can get them for $ 10-$12 . I do n't buy them at retail . I prefer the nano 's to the polly 's ( google ) . And the 80/20 's to the phosphor bronze for sound , but that would depend on your woods , and the sound you want . I sometimes use Phosphor Bronze on my all Maple , to offset the brightness of maple . These are my fsvorite strings .
5 #### It 's a Nook , they are great ! This one features a backlit screen which means you can read it in bed without keeping anyone awake . My only complaint is the clunky software to transfer books off a computer . I 'm sure this has been remedied in newer versions , but aside from that this is a great alternative to a regular tablet which can bother some people 's eyes from prolonged reading . The lack of glare is also very nice . Ca n't say that about your iPad when you try looking at it in any kind of sunlight !
5 #### Made my Wii compatible with my new HD TV . Still only pay 7.99 a month to Netflix and 79.99 per year to Amazon for Prime so I get all the TV I want with this product . Love it .
4 #### Overall , I like it . In summation : Pros : -Good construction -Quality leather , feels good to the touch -Easy to slip iPhone into -Good access to external buttons and screen -Holster is easy to slip covered unit into Cons : -Well protected on 3 sides . Upside , easy access to external buttons . Downside , less protection . -Holster holds covered iPhone too loosely . A horizontal positioning will result in many ejected iPhones
5 #### i had bought a non retracting cord to replace the one in my vehicle , but it was too much " line " hanging everywhere . i like the retractable one for the car so its not in my way . the connections are sturdy and its a good product so far .
5 #### This thing is crazy how well it covers the berry . It comes with a keyboard cover that I all most threw away . Fits like OJ 's glove . Too cool .
5 #### Brought new life into the dusty dry guitar I got :)
4 #### These cable channels are big enough for 1 HDMI cable , but nothing more . If you need to run multiple cables you should look elsewhere . Had to return them . They are good if you need to run 1 HDMI or 1 power cord .
1 #### these were advertised to fit the habra stone . they did not . i do n't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it . not even one piece fit . threw them away
5 #### Extremely bright , seems to simulate old style aircraft landing lights . Mounted sideways on my 13 F-150 with the tabs inside the grill opening . Had to open the lights and turn them in the rims for correct beam . no problem with wiring , just like the instructions said . Should be great out here in the open deserts and ranges of NM .
3 #### Loved them when they worked , but started falling apart after 1 1/2 years .
4 #### Sometimes I need a longer cable to charge my iPhone and iPad and this cable works great .
3 #### So far I 've tried the Otterbox Defender and this Incipio Silicrylic . The Otterbox not only offers the best protection but you do n't have to deal with those stick on screen protectors . With the Insipio you first apply the soft shell , then the hard shell . The Otterbox is the opposite : apply the hard shell then the soft shell . So the Otterbox is less likely to slip out of your hand . However , the black model does require a frequent brushing as it easily attracts a bit of lint . Not a deal breaker but some may not like that . My wife has the pink with flower design Otterbox which is a bit harder and does not attract the lint . I had no problem pushing the side buttons with either the Otterbox or Incipio . If you do n't like bulky cases this is definitley less bulk then the Otterbox Defender but personally I do n't see the point with its limited protection .
5 #### these may possibly be the best strings ever ! have them on all 4of my acoustic guitars ! great sounding , long lasting !
5 #### We use a number of these cost effective switches in a variety of applications . Great for multiple computers in the same area . Great price point too . NETGEAR is always a good buy . Very simple install - couldn't be easier .
5 #### Works fine , wo n't notice any difference if you spend a lot more for a fancy brand name .
4 #### I ordered this case cause I had dropped my Droid . I also ordered another just like this one from another Amazon page ; one cost $ 2.89 and the other $ 0.98 or something like that . I wanted to use the best one , but they were both just alike except for color . I advise to get the cheapest one of these since they both work fine for the purpose they are intended .
5 #### Pros : small , not protruding like others , lightweight and comfortable . Batter last too long ... lol , mic quality is great . twist sorta flat for storage in pocket etc . Multi - Link is great Cons : Sometimes volume could be louder in noisy environments , easy to lose the foam mic cover . buttons are hard to press ( on / off ) but not too bad . I do n't know how I lived without this . I can link it up with my wife 's phone and my phone at the same time , or my laptop and phone . I use Skype and other microphone based programs on my laptop , and I can play ( listen & talk ) in online games , talk via Skype and still have it linked to my cell phone at the same time . Very very handy . If you multitask frequently I definately recommend this headset !
5 #### I usually do n't leave write reviews but this product should have it . I was and applied the water repellant as per the instructions(using a light brush to apply repellant ) and it came out GREAT ! By using a rag brush or a rag you control the repellant by not allowing it to get on your car 's finish and glass . The water beads better than new from the show room and I 'm extremely pleased with this product ! I highly recommend it to anyone who is VERY particular about their car as I.
5 #### The best deal I ve been able to find on jacks with a locking pin ( which is an important safety feature if you 're crawling under the vehicle ) . Only better price was at Northern Tool and their brand appears to be cheaper build quality . Highly satisfied with my purchase .
5 #### Awesome stuff for cleaning inside of car . Works well on outside rubber and plastic also . I had used the spray bottle before and loved it . The wipes do a good job --- but when these are gone , I 'll go back to the spray bottle and a microfiber cloth .
5 #### Gr8 guitar for the price . Sounds gr8 . Very satisfied for sure
5 #### I tried the clip on and they shook so much you could n't see anything , brought them back to the auto store . Got these on Amazon for a fantastic price , no shipping charge , and they are perfect . Easy to install , easy to adjust , and I can see everything in back of my Casita trailer . Pulling with a 2003 Tundra . Ca n't beat the product , price or Amazon !
4 #### These picks were around when I was a kid ( -I'm 56 ) . They 're still around and pretty much the same ( Aficionados discuss a difference in quality since D'Andrea stopped making these picks for Fender , but it 's not a difference that would be noticeable to 99.9 % of guitar players . ) My jazz - playing friends who use " Benson picking " prefer this pick to all others . ( " Benson picking " refers to an unorthodox way of gripping the pick named for George Benson , one of the greatest jazz guitarists of all time . ) It is cheap , consistent , and available everywhere . I prefer a smaller pick but I keep a few of these atop my Polytone at all times .
3 #### I 've been using this transmitter for over 2 years , and it does a good job .. but it does n't handle obstacles very well , even indoor . I love the fact that it helps you focus even in extremely dark situations , very handy even when you are not going to trigger a flash . I 've use it with canon and metz flashes and they both work great with it , you can graduate power between flash ... Overall it 's ok , especially because you do n't need receivers connected to the flash . I would n't recommend it if you take most of your pictures outdoor .
4 #### This is my favorite style for use during hunting . The mic can be positioned as close or far from your mouth as you like it . Once it is where you want it you do n't have to keep moving it toward your mouth so the person you are speaking to can hear . Fits comfortably over your head and rests gently on your ear . Only problem I have had is on 1 of them ( I have 2 ) the ear piece broke off the headset after a year 's use .
5 #### These little jewels are the best way to protect your apple - I. Some one I worked with showed me their 2 teat phone and it looked new .
5 #### The liiittle foam pads on the bottom and sides are getting a lot of wear but still sticking . Its way better than windshield mounting .
5 #### My grandfather had these on his truck for as long as I could remember . My truck just did n't seem right until I found these and put them on my truck . Grandpa 's were AT LEAST 15 years old and were still in pretty good shape . I 've had mine on my truck for a year now , and the mud and road grime have n't made a dent .
5 #### Worked on my motor coach . Had one just like it that i replaced with .
5 #### Literally took out of the box and stood it up . No assembly required . Purchased this for a rider cymbal . Very easy to adjust the height and angle . Very happy with this stand !
5 #### the Logitech Cordless Trackman is easy to set up under OSX 10.2.6 the only thing you have to add the driver from the Apple site . But once dome it is a dream to use and I would not do with out it . I have for a momth om my G4 1 gig Power Mac and I totaly love it . I would tell all Mac users to go for it you will not be sorry .
5 #### I installed this yesterday . It 's a tad loose and came with a small rubber wedge . I 'm going to make up some of my own . It really looks sharp . This item was about mid range in price to others available . I chose this one as it appeared to be the right size and it kind of molded with the looks of the truck . I would strongly suggest buying a hitch lock as this is an item some may want to borrow and never return it .
5 #### Brand and an unrealistic price got me to buy this . Works great and I can hear it on my motorcycle .
4 #### I am not going to repeat all previous reviewers on excellency of AM and FM receiving . It 's all true . But quality of product is just horrible . Look , I formerly lived in Ukraine and Soviet Union and to tell you the truth I have n't seen such horrible finish and quality in Soviet portable radios . Quality or a lack of it is just appalling . The tuning knob will fell off very soon . There 's no soft material under battery door - so battery rattle ( I put some paper inside it cured rattle ) . I understand this product made in China , but look you can buy Sony , Grundig , or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in China , as a matter of fact , almost everything nowdays made in China . It 's not a question whether or not something made in China it 's a matter how good it made there . This radio is obviously was made in garage in China . Just tell me why , but why there 's no light on tuning scale , how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb . GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all . I would n't ever buy this product for looks . It looks awful , but reception on AM is excellent , yes it is .
3 #### I bought this primarily because the price was very attractive ( 15 dollars ) . The biggest issue I have is that there is no on / off indicator . The on / off button is the same and one never knows easily if the device is on or off . The documentation everywhere completely omits reference . Called Plantronics and they kept insisting that a blue light should display when on ; they shipped me a new product twice . Both times the product behaved the same - which was frustrating . I think this is the design and I will not contact plantronics anymore . Otherwise , the product works fine and sound quality is good . Worth the price I paid .
5 #### Love these mud flaps . Moved across the US after installing these . Could n't be happier with this purchase !
5 #### The quality was very good for the price . The fit was fine . Arrived on time and met my expectations . If you are going to spend 50,000 dollars on a truck , you would like a trim piece like this to go with it !
5 #### Must have , quality tool for removing radiator fan on your MB W124 diesel with M603 engine . I am an ASE certified auto mechanic with years of MB experience
5 #### I love these covers . I bought them to keep my phone protected from finger prints and from makeup while I am talking . And to keep dust off the main part of the phone . These work great and are easy to put on . If you get bubbles under it while you are putting it on you can just lift up on it a little and put it back down , it is really easy to work with while your installing . It is not like you put in down and it does n't come back up if needed . Just take your time and you will have no problems getting it on correctly . Then buy a snazzy cover for your phone . Would recommend them anyday !
5 #### Got this at a very generous discount and was still nervous about the purchase . But holy crap this 30 year old , untouched design sure does push sound like those sets that are twice the PortaPro 's MSRP price . Like everyone else said - this thing looks like a failed hearing aid prototype from the ' 60 's . But after using it I do n't give a damn what it looks like . It 's definitely worth the buy . Folds up nicely for traveling .
5 #### A good deal on a good product . Perfect for your MP3 player , laptop PC , tablet , and even for your TV ( if you add an extension cable ) !
4 #### I have owned these for 1 - 1/2 years now and have used them mainly when flying on commercial jets . Their ability to cancel noise is better than the several other low - cost models I have tried , especially on jets . They are very comfortable . Their sound quality is good but I would n't say excellent . They appear to be more durably made than most other low - cost headphones . I have had no problems whatsoever , in spite of them getting squashed in my briefcase many times . They are relatively large , closed ear cup headphones , but fold up and store easily in a provided bag .
5 #### This BB 8900 skin fits perfectly and has a nice texture . No issues after a few weeks of use . Hits the spot .
2 #### I bought these for $ 35 and loved the sound and thought the voice clarity ( while not great ) was decent enough for the price range . While some people had trouble hearing me in loud or windy environments , I could deal with the headset as it was comfortable , easy to use and could fit in my pockets pretty easily . Music sounded rich and full and hearing voices in stereo always made talking on them pretty nice ( beware if you have friends with shrill voices ... ) I started to fall out of love when I realized that putting the phone in my pocket or on my belt holster killed the connection . If I was walking , on the metro or working out , I would have to hold the phone in front of my chest , or behind my back which pretty much negating the whole handsfree idea . While I could deal with occasionally spotty music reception , the connection would also go out on business calls and that 's not acceptable . I tried to deal with that issue , but soon the cord from the right earphone started to short out . Since I could n't rely on the thing to turn on or stay connected , I dropped it out of service .
5 #### This item is perfect for a simple , classy looking phone pouch without the frills . The clip is sturdy and strong ( still , after using it every day at work for the last month of owning it now ) . There are also belt loops but I have not used them yet . The magnet in the flap is strong enough to keep it closed even when it 's being jostled around . It fit my DROID 3 perfectly , but I had to take off the case I had for it . Since my phone spends a lot of it 's time in this phone pouch , I have n't really needed the case . The soft interior of this pouch keeps it from getting roughed up .
4 #### I like the fact that it was at a resonable price and very easy to assemble . TV looks great on the wall .
5 #### A must buy for anyone that needs a charge converter for 30 pins . My car oem ipod integration only supported the old 30 pin charging format and it would not charge my iphone with the 30 pin to lightning converter . This device solved that issue with flying colors . I had the Scosche passPORT , however that charge converter causes a lot of high pitch static background noises .
3 #### Just a cheap strap . It has pop off the button a couple of times .
5 #### LOVE IT AND IT CAME AS I ESPECTED THANKS . THE COLOR ARE BRITE , BEUTIFUL . THE DATE THAT I HAD TO RECIVE IT WAS THE RIGHT DATE VERY RESPONSABLE .
5 #### I bought these stands to support my Richelieu Banjo and Martin Guitar while on stage . They do the job admirably , and fold compactly for transport . Over 50 + years of playing I 've had many different stands , and these are easily among the best . They are certainly the most compact .
4 #### The IMP52D has been disappointing . It charges very fast ; it supplies a lot of current . The charge delivered is only about 50%-60 % of rated capacity . I have owned batteries that delivered as much or more than their rated capacity . The form factor is very good . It fits anywhere in my ScottEvest jackets , and I do like the LED light and the laser . The ergonomics are very good . I use the laser often in presentations . Unfortunately , this " 5200 " mAh battery is actually a " 2600 " mAh battery . For me , that is unacceptable . The core capability of this is as a battery , and it does not perform anywhere near its stated capacity . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * UPDATE 6/6/14 : New Trent did replace this with another unit and the new unit works very well . I am now getting about 70 % capacity from the battery which is acceptable in comparison to everyone else that overstates the true battery capacity delivery . The great form factor , laser pointer and flashlight all are the same great additions to a good battery . New Trent has had one of the most responsive and best customer service efforts I have seen . You can not go wrong with a New Trent product ; you WILL be taken care of in an exemplary manner .
4 #### Reading the ads and other persons ' reveiws , I expected it to be smaller and lighter . It is actually a little bit too big for my ear ( since I am a small person ) , it fell down sometimes ( I have to avoid sudden movement ) . I think it would be ok for an average ( size ) person . However , the design is nice . I wish it will come in white color so it will match my AT&T phone . It can be used with many device with 2.5 mm . plug such as cellular phone , computer , also works on my Motorola Fr50 two - way radio . Sound is clear and loud , it 's a little amplifier , I have to dial the phone before putting it on because the dial tones of the phone through this head set is so loud , it hurts my ear . It hurts even more after a long time talking because of its weight hanging on my ear . The material ( plastic ) is quite hard and sturdy . In conclusion , it works , it 's inexpensive , multiple devices compatible . However person who look for a very comfortable head set may not like this one .
5 #### I had these before and loved them . I order them from eTech and it was just cheap plastic . Ordered it from Importer 520 and its actually anti glare . Looks so good and feels good under my fingers . I suggest you order theses but only from importer 520 they are good for HTC EVO 4 g
5 #### looks really cool and sounds great . no buzz or unwanted noise with these cables , and they have a velcro strap which makes it easy to store them when you are done . i like them a lot .
5 #### My daughter 's car has a convertible top that was splotchy and faded . Followed the directions on this product , and it looks nearly new . Very happy with the results .
4 #### If you are replacing your old butterfly trees , you can use the same holes clip and sand off the alignment pins , as they are not really needed , and just add another hole to your headstock . Good trees for the price .
3 #### These would nt stay in tune on my Les Paul when I tuned it to B. Tried C and still would nt stay tuned . They would only go to D in tune .
5 #### They were pretty easy to install . I get a lot of compliments on them . Love the black , especially since I have a black jeep . Goes very well with it . And they provide excellent light . Of course they are n't LED . But I got these for the black background on them . If you 're looking for awesome lighting and do n't mind the shininess , check out some LED lights . But otherwise , these are good lights .
5 #### Purchased this item for a 1999 Honda Valkyrie Motorcycle and it works great ( with a little help )
5 #### I just picked up these headphones after maybe a year of not using them . They were packed away in a box from when I moved . While I typically use my Audio - Technica ATH - M50 's for listening at home , I had forgotten what phenomenal sound the Koss PortaPro 's brought to the table . A wonderful headphone well worth the money . While they look a little dated , these headphones offer terrific sound for the on the go listener .
5 #### Handy and compact . Good for playing out . For thin electric guitars , not thick acoustic .
5 #### Easy to use and cleans the filter very well and then re - oils it
5 #### All wires marked correctly which made for a very easy install of the new after market radio .
5 #### this stand is small but does the job.and folds up in to a small package.i have one for each guitar
1 #### I had to buy 6 of these , just to get 2 & after I used 1 , it wo n't rewind . It does n't even tell you what the A - B means on the back of the head cleaner .
4 #### Great replacement to protect your cymbals from stress cracks . Durable material .
5 #### What can you say about a cable ? It works fine and looks well made .
4 #### Great cheap binocs for the price . Just one thing keeping them from 5 stars : They 'd have been better off skipping the cheap permanently attached lanyard string and including an eye - hole ( or two ) on the body somewhere to hook the thing up to your own lanyard or neckstrap instead . The problem with the permanently attached cord is that it 's not only cheap , but does n't hang so the binoculars balance properly on your chest . They have a tendency to hang forward . Not to mention that a narrow string is uncomfortable and possibly even dangerous .
5 #### works just like it says .. easy to adjust very strong and sturdy .. neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto neeto
4 #### This tape is a dull matte silver with black lettering - perfect for my application . Do not expect shiny silver .
5 #### one of the best strings that I have used over the last 20 some what years playing
5 #### What more can you say . It works like expected . The cable did n't appear to be cheaply made and all hardware interfaced using the cable worked perfectly .
4 #### Used on my 2003 ford mustang . No issue with connection .
5 #### If you 've got any devices that have cables , this is the best system for keeping the cables controlled . Whether you 're traveling or simply want to gather cables together so they 're not hanging or lying all over the place , these " ties " do the job .
5 #### got this short cord to go from amp to waa ! It works perfect for it I own a few Spectraflex cables and they are all fine
4 #### I had one of these metal bike pumps that lasted close to 10 years before the coonnection at the tube finally gave away . I replaced it with this one , very similar design . Using it to quickly top off vehicle tires , and get a work out while doing it :) Great for the price , should get a number of years of use out of it . Update - after a couple years of regular use the hose failed at the point where it connects to the pump . It is a very flimsy hose , the weak point with this pump . You can replace the hose although Custom Accessories ( the manufacturer / seller ) does n't offer one . So I am purchasing this hand pump again .
5 #### what can I say but wow ! This is a great product . I was removing a large fallen tree from the trail . When it wedged between two other trees it snapped in half . Did n't even phase the winch , it kept right on pulling ! I hooked to a full size truck and it dragged my toyota across the parking lot with all four wheels locked and a spare tire for a wheel chock . The motor " geared down " , but did n't slow down , it just dragged my truck because it was a lot lighter . This was a single line pull , and it had enough power to drag my truck the full 100 Ft of cable . WARN Power , I am totaly impressed . So glad I held out for the Warn , it is worth the extra cost all day long . I did a lot of research before I bought a winch . The tech specs and reviews were the best in the industry for this class of winch . I have seen reviews for other makes and there seems to be packaging issues . This winch arrived perfect in the box with absolutely no damage . Do n't settle for a cheaper make , buy the best , you wo n't regret it ! Made in USA quality !
5 #### This is by far and without doubt the most comfortable banjo strap I 've owned . I bought two I liked it so much and use one on each of my current banjos .
5 #### The simplest capo on the market . I own several of these and like them more than any other capo I have tried . Many complain that they are not adjustable , but I have never had issues . If the tension pulls you out of tune , just bend the back support a little to adjust tension .
4 #### Great price for these high quality optics - amazingly clear , rocket fast to focus , rubber coating makes them easy to hold , but I prefer using the tripod adapter . The diopter adjustment is a breeze between my wife 's viewing preferences and my own , so we 're having no problem sharing these back and forth . The Bushnell neck strap is a little cheesy and certainly too thin for the weight of these binoculars . A token lens cleaning cloth , lens covers and a nylon carrying case are provided as well - I will upgrade to an OP / TECH neck strap .
5 #### Excellent gadget bag . This holds everything I need including a small underwater camera . For my needs , it 's great . Quality is excellent !
1 #### bought one , it broke on the 1st use . they sent me a new one for free and that one broke in 2 days .. the suction cup one the device is the problem ... i think . idk but i would spend an extra 10 and get a better one from amazon or drop 40 and just go to the apple store and buy it from there . DO NOT BUY
3 #### These are ok but the ones I previously purchased with bigger ear coverings feel much better
4 #### I give the 4 rating on this because its not I Phone But it works just like the Apple product .
5 #### Perfect to hold our camera body and 2 lenses . With a little room to spare .
5 #### Well made . Good price . Fit perfectly on two year old Mazda CX-5 which needs a 24 " , an 18 " and a 14 " replacement blade . Easy to install . Good investment for your vision , safety , and to work properly when there is rough weather .
5 #### I purchased this to insulate the inside of my 1993 Honda CBR1000F fairing . It gets hot riding in stop and go traffic in Chicago , and I needed something to help keep the engine heat off my legs . This product fit the bill perfectly . I cut pieces to fit on the inside of my fairing to reflect engine heat away from my legs . The adhesive sticks well and the product works as advertised . Very happy with it .
5 #### this is a difficult review . the product is worth 5 stars hands down . It functions correctly easily goes together and all around looks nice . HOWEVER ! ! ! ! ! those of you with a civic ( mines a 2003 ) YOU DON'T NEED THIS THING ! when I unbolted my stereo from its surround , I realized my new stereo would fit right in . I decided to not use this bracket because I loved having the pocket beneath the stereo with the door , it holds my phone and anything else I might have . This Dash Kit looks nicer tho . With the original car dash the radio seats up and bolts down but does n't look great . It looks OKAY but not great . This dash kit makes it look a lot nicer BUT you lose the door beneath the radio , again that was important to me ! I was bummed when I found out I was going to lose it ! SO yes it works , no you do n't need it . My advice is if you do n't use or care about the door buy this ! it looks nice and works well , if you love pocket with door , do n't buy this ! lol
5 #### works like a charm Sometimes you have to change a connection !
5 #### I have lots of equipment that must be greased on a yearly basis and I need a grease gun that will handle all the equipment regardless of sise or pressure requirements . I needed one with a flexible hose to get into those tight spaces too . I use mainly lithium all purpose grease cartridges in this thing and these are really easy to install too . Once the catridge is installed and ready to go , all I got to do is put the coupler end onto the grease zerk and pump three times for each grease zerk , that s it ! This thing holds so much grease that you will be greasing till the cows come home before you run out ! The things I like most about this grease gun are its durability , pressure capacity , grease capacity , flexible hose , and its got a cover for the tip of the coupler so that you do n't contaminate the grease . This is a must have tool if you value your equipments life and do n't want to deal with siesed bearings , spindles , etc ... I have had no problems with the gun at all . 5 Stars !
4 #### It is a battery a good battery It is a good battery IT IS A GOOD BATTERY It is a good battery It is a good battery
5 #### Ok , what can you expect for $ 15 ... not much I think . So I was very surprised when these binoculars were clear and were well constructed . I wanted a small pair to throw in my backpack with magnification in this range and did n't want to spend a lot since I would n't use them too much . These fill the bill just fine . And I could focus down to about 10 feet which was more than I expected also . Definitely recommend them .
5 #### Good quality resistance band , I bought it for my son . He uses it in a gym . It is exactly what he needs .
5 #### These picks are great . They are very thin , easy to grip and they last a long time . I was always cracking fender picks and even Dunlop picks , but these almost never break . They are the best .
3 #### It does n't fit my existing cases but I will find a way to use it , either a binder or a hole puncher may be the solution .
5 #### love it .... wish it was longer but definitely worth every penny . no more adjusting the bar mirror tower one from academy .
4 #### I gave these to my spouse primarily for the TV and so the audio does n't really need to be top notch ; I have no idea exactly how good these are in that respect . He seems pleased with them but frankly , as they are a gift , he is n't likely to say anything bad .
5 #### I prefer Dunlop strap locks to all the other types . They 're a little difficult to install , but they 're perfect once you get them on . I 've used them for years and never had a problem .
1 #### Got these for my kids guitar thinking they 'd be easy on his fingers . They 're too thin . They barely register on the pickups , presumably no enough mass to get a good response . They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords . Switched to 9 's . These are horrible .
5 #### This is a great item . I am very happy with this purchase .
2 #### This case was easy to remove , but very flimsy . It cracked the first time I put it on my phone .
5 #### Drove 630 miles through driving rain , sprinkles and mist . This is good stuff . I did have to replace it back on the windshield after my trip . But it WAS 630 miles .
4 #### The switch is easy to install on and remove from the camera . It functions well . It is well designed ; the shape makes it easy to hold . The trigger button works smoothly . I especially like that it 's designed for the cable to be wound around the body of the switch and cable stores into the notches to keep it wound . There 's also a storage location for the plug . Good design .
2 #### Thought I would need this to supplement a beginner xylophone that I bought . The Xylo had better mallets included with it , so really this purchase was not necessary for me . Unfortunately , when you buy a Xylo this is one of items that comes up as a suggested add on . In essence , I was duped .
5 #### You should know what these things can do , they are awesome .
4 #### Louder than I would have preferred , otherwise a solid muffler .
4 #### The price of these lights went from $ 30.96 to $ 39.09 overnight . I felt the $ 8.13 jump was unreasonable and dropped them from the order I was preparing . I am familiar with these lights and they are very good . My only objection was the approximate 26%+ addition to the cost .
5 #### I received the product and it was for a gift . My friend was happy with the product and really enjoys it a lot .
1 #### Does n't Do The Job .. I am replacing these after just a few weeks .... they do n't wipe clean .... the Rain - X Weatherbeater Wiper I bought on Amazon for my other car perform flawlessly . I just ordered them for this car too .
5 #### These replacement bulbs make nighttime driving much much safer . Toyotas original bulbs are a disgrace . Very easy to instal .
5 #### I am using these with our Linux Mint system . I just plug them into the jack on the right hand speaker ( Harmon Kardon ) . They work fine . Very good sound quality , much better than I expected for the price . I was also surprised that they do n't interfere with my ability to hear sounds in the room around me . They are comfortable and light in weight . I would definitely recommend these to anyone who needs headphones .
5 #### Got 2 of them and they work great . strong quality .
5 #### These look great ! I know it says these are batter heads but being single ply they are well suited to being used as resonant heads , which is what I am using it for . The look of these are great , with a high shine and a cool blacked out appearance . B
5 #### Now this is great for going out for the day if you like your eggs & bacon with beans .
5 #### Fit tightly onto the ends of the crossbars . Note : If you are JUST ordering the crossbars , you will need to order the end caps separately ; it does not come with them . If you are ordering the feet and fit kit , they are included with the feet . I did purchase this separately because the ends of the bars can be sharp , and I wanted the extra set in case one gets lost .
5 #### There is a K&N filter on all of my vehicles so I use this product a lot .
5 #### Great oil pan / storage container . Works great on lowered vehicles and caps actually work . ( No leaks ) The last container lasted over five years and only failed because of user error .
3 #### its a cool antenna , been a week now an still on car window , but transmit an receive only a mile if that , I probably wo n't be using it much .
3 #### I have had this product for a while and it worked great until the little cord in the bottom started to break from being bent back and forth so many times . It 's a design flaw that should not be overlooked .
5 #### got the original portapros back in the early 80s and been using the successive variants ever since . nothing beats these for performance vs. value . I 'm a picky listener ( mostly classical ) and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the 1960s but these little headphones from Koss have been great ever since the type was introduced . get some , you will be pleased .
5 #### The was a sweet holder . I picked one up at Wal - Mart and I was surprised at how well it worked . It come with a plastic disk that I stuck on to the inside of my slide - out cup - holder in my truck - it worked perfectly . Unfortunately someone broke into my truck and stole it ( and my sub - woofers ) . I never used my sub - woofers . I was more upset about my iPhone mount being stolen ! I could n't find another one at Wal - Mart . Thank goodness for Amazon ! :)
5 #### This mic works GREAT . And for the price you ca n't beat it . I am using it for my onemanband act and the sound of my bass drum is very important .
4 #### These wo n't be mistaken for high quality headphones , but they 're good for the price . They 've got good sound , but I 'm a bit disappointed at the build quality , especially the thin leads . But , again , for the price not a bad deal .
3 #### Its nice because it holds cell phone and credit cars , Drivers licence and cash but I drop it and the corners of my phone got scratched so I do n't use this case anymore . I still recommend this case for people who do n't drop their phones .
5 #### Took two orders to get an intact charging station but if you can get a good one , these are awesome . The bottom slot is good for holding tablets or odds and ends like keys , and the top areas fit most phones . The smaller ones on the side fit my iPhone 5 no problem .
4 #### Good price but have rubber tips and plastic clips that break off easily does the job do n't expect them to last a long time you get what you pay for received them from the company very quickly
5 #### I needed a longer usb cord for my printer to my computer and this did the job . Works great and highly recommend .
5 #### It was a very good bought . I like it a lot .
5 #### These are the best ! I have a number of different sticks , but I always end up using these .
1 #### I read all the reviews about the Thule rack system , and I read that you needed to order this separate , well you do n't have to if you order the 480 Traverse foot pack , they came with them . I contacted Amazon for a refund , which they did instantly , and then told me to keep them .
5 #### I 'm thinking that this booster would 've worked well if we would 've had an adequate signal to boost . After trying several times I called tech support at Wilson and they suggested that I check to see if we had 70 - 90db available to boost . When we realized that there was n't a strong enough signal to boost we were able to repackage and return the booster . Great customer service !
1 #### Tried this in the mountains and it failed to do anything . We have Verizon - people with Iphones sometimes get signal at my house but we have Droids and there is nothing . The booster did n't do a thing for the Droid . Disappointed & returned .
5 #### I have a RV1250 Tripp - Lite inverter and installed in my 36 ' RV . It supplies power to my entertainment system including surround sound system , other TV 's and a residential frig / freezer . It 's very important to be able to monitor load and battery condition at all times . The inverter is in a storage compartment under the coach so being able to see the inverter status requires a trip outside . With the APSRM4 those days are gone ! The connecting cable is supplied with 50 ' of freedom from inverter to any point in most applications . The remote also allows you to switch the inverter into a charge only position so that when you are either hooked up to shore power or you have the generator running the inverter is only maintaining the battery level with its built in charger . Fantastic accessory , as I said it should be part of the inverter when you make the purchase . Not as a free - be but it should be included , it is invaluable ! A must have for sure !
5 #### These are great , affordable cables . Not sure the difference between these cables and more expensive ones but these work just fine .
3 #### It fit well and went on in a cinch , but I purchased this to reduce wind noise ... which it does ! But now I get this incessant vibration sound unless I crack both rear windows . So the point was sort of defeated .
5 #### One of the few metal cased , attractively priced switches . Ca n't go wrong with this sucker .
4 #### This is a good deal . I bought two , for two different phones , and was pleased to find that they both worked .
5 #### Do nt diss this book . It was a heart warming story that gave a real perspective of a terrifying war . I know what searching for someone that you know deep down wo n't return feels like . My best friend died an I am still searching as young Connie and lovable Charlie - mouse did for Malcolm
4 #### Sure , there are better and worse headphones out there , but , for the price , these are tough to beat imo . My son is a computer game fanatic , and I thought that he 'd eventually want to upgrade from these . However , after two years of use , and replacing the worn out ear pads , he 's still happy with their performance , to my surprise , as he often wants the latest , and greatest , but is still very satisfied with these . Hmmm , no wonder many radio stations around the country , use these as well , imo , they are a proven performer .
5 #### This stuff is like magic .. magic I say ... makes weak audio equipment come back to life .
5 #### I was really worried about losing a cup holder but this is a real life savor .. So easy to use the phone and do n't have to worry about your phone falling down or the sun preventing your from seeing the screen !
5 #### work great and easy to release unlike other brands I have used
5 #### Works really well for an ukulele , and for my banjo . I 'll probably pick a second one up so I can travel and not worry about losing it . I like the ease with which it can be put on and removed , and it seems fairly sturdy . I 'm not sure how the coils will hold up to repeated use , but I guess I 'll keep an eye out and update my review if it fails sooner than I would want . Just do n't buy this for a guitar if you ( for some reason ) are thinking about it . Go pay the price for an actual guitar one ( this is too small ) .
5 #### I ca n't get enough of it . It 's such a great amplifier . So small but so cool . In the way it 's made . I ca nt get over all the effects it has on it . Really keeps me happy .
3 #### Purchased 10 of these to use in vans on a missions trip . Only in the state of Indiana did our caravan have a problem . We had to take 3 E - ZPasses out to be read ... it was also just one toll booth lane ... the rest of the vehicles in other lanes had no problems . It also effected the new and older model E - Zpasses . On the way home we got permission from the rental company to use install the velcro . I will also say using these on the windshield they held on ... no problem with the suction cups .
5 #### It works , it 's snagless . Perhaps with some high end test equipment I could find a flaw , but none are visible by me . Five stars .
5 #### Previously Adelphia had setup my cable using two daisy chained 2 way splitters . This caused my HD signals to drop very frequently , especially on HBO . It was so bad that I could n't watch the HD feed at all . I was told that this would not solve my problem from a local high end A / V store , but they were dead wrong . Once I replaced the 2 splitters with 1 4 - way splitter my signal was perfect . In fact , the reception on the analog stations also improved dramatically . To ensure the best signal I have also added other hardware : 1 Motorola Drop amp , 1 Monster 4 way loss loss splitter , then a Monster PowerCenter HTS 2100 with video filtering .
5 #### Works well and the POE ports provide plenty of power .
4 #### I purchased a used one for recording direct , then found out that it needs a cabinet simulator to sound good . Mine is an older model with the 1/8 " power jack , so I do n't know if they updated the cab sim since then . In order to get a good recorded tone , I need to use the speaker sim on my digitech hot head , or some vst plug - ins . It is very well built , has a lot of tone options , and with a cab sim it sounds very much like a mic'ed amp , but I prefer the character series because they sound more realistic to me .
5 #### Great all around mic ! I have had this mic for a number of years and you can not beat the quality of this dynamic mic for the price . I primarily use this for recording vocals into Protools and Logic Pro X. Works great on male vocals , trumpet , acoustic guitar , piano , I mean this mic can literally do anything and sound great . Besides being an industry standard for broadcasting , the SM7 was used to record some amazing records such as Thriller by Michael Jackson , and is the mic used in most vocal recordings ( that I know of ) by Anthony Keidis and the Red Hot Chili Peppers . This mic has been used on so many stellar albums its incredible that it costs less than $ 400 .
3 #### I mounted this and plugged it all up last night . It certainly seems to be a decently designed and made device , and I believe it will serve well in the role of outlet strip . Why three stars ? It 's because I read the fine print on the package concerning warranty . The Amazon website description touts a $ 10,000 equipment warranty . But the package fine print states that the equipment must be " computer equipment " . It also states that the warranty is void in case of lightning strikes . Why else do we buy surge suppressors ? So the device is good , but the description of the warranty is misleading .
5 #### Works . iPhone is a pig anyway so it does n't like to share on any port but , I have other things that work well together on it . Blue glow helps finding it in the dark .
5 #### I did n't know a little battery powered amp could sound so good . It sounds just as good if not better than my Roland Cube 20 , of course without the effects and such , but still , a great little amp for practice and a little gig with family and friends . Puts out pretty good power for a little 5w . Has a great sound in my opinion .
5 #### What can you say about such a blase item ? Bottom line , the cable is solid , works well and has never given me any problem .
4 #### Heavy Duty . Used this tool when performing a timing belt , tensioner , water pump change on my 2005 Honda Civic EX 1.7 . Need to use with a breaker bar ( 1/2 in ) or prybar . Wish there was a better way to loosen and tighten the harmonic balancer belt while preventing the movement of TDC ( Top Dead Center ) .
4 #### put on the middle of the rear window of my truck and looks great ... hardly notice it while driving unless I focus my eyes on it .
4 #### The single best case I 've ever had for my Epiphone electric guitar ..
5 #### Great product ! I 've been using this oil on our K&N filter for years . Glad to have found it in a bigger container .
4 #### Good product for the money , anybody want to buy it from me as I bought a new car and now don"t need it !
5 #### Used this body and filler to get a nice smooth finish job
5 #### I am asked often where did I purchase the case for my Blackberry . Amazon of course and it is noticeble meaning that I can look in my purse and find it . It 's easy to maintain and expected to last for about a year . With the rhinestones they do tend to come off but that 's expected . Anyone that wants to reinforce them can just put clear acrylic on the case or clear fingernail polish . Otherwise , it was everything that I expected .
1 #### The one Amazon sent me did not work , sent it back for refund . Great looking and seems well made , but need some quality control on this product .
5 #### This products work for what i was using it for ( an old iPod touch ) . I 'm pleased but this is VERY easy to lose .
5 #### Item was exactly as shown and shipped promptly , will use again . THANX ! ! !
4 #### Got these for my son and he said they did the job .
4 #### Four stars because I bet it works for some , even though it did n't solve my particular problem . You could also try some of the Furman Power Conditioners / Surge Protectors ( I got the Furman PST-8D ) which offer the same ground isolating functionality along with other benefits and multiple outlets for about double the price of one of these - since if you 're really having grounding issues , you 're probably going to need more than one of these to solve it with multiple pieces of equipment anyway .
2 #### Does not work with Yamaha product I purchased it for
5 #### If you want to get the most out of your towing lights harness or you truck harness you need these covers ... I will never again go without this product ... fit tight does n't fall off with road vibration ... Buy , Buy , Buy ...
1 #### Wonder why this is so cheap ? Well ... I guess this may work out fine for anyone who uses the internet for no more than 15 minutes at a time or they do n't mind unhooking all connections and bebooting every few minutes . Every once in awhile you may get lucky and stay connected for an hour . Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for something that works . I wound up buying a SMC Barricade and no more problems . The Linksus really deserves a -five stars .
5 #### This is one tough case . A little heavy , but it really protects the phone . I dropped mine off a combine onto the concrete and scuffed the case but did n't hurt the phone . I have also had a cup of beer dumped on me and all it did to the phone was make the trackball a little sticky for a couple of days . Great case for people with dirty hobbies or jobs .
2 #### The cable is crooked and pieces of plastic are still on the female end around the connection . It would be nice if the controls on the earphones worked with this extension cable . Sound is acceptable .
5 #### as long as you remember what it is and not what you wish it was . Just received my shipment of the Epiphone Les Paul SPECIAL - II . It came well packaged with plenty of padding and no dings on the outer box . Shippinhg was box within a box and the outer box was extremely heavy duty . The guitar ... no rough edges , straight neck , no dings . Perfect condition . As I would have hoped , the strings were a tad loose , no problem . I 'll be sticking to light strings as I have n't held a six string in over 40 years . All the hardware was tight with the exception of the toggle switch knob . This guitar is a great bargain for someone just starting out or getting back into playing , you get better than decent hardware and Gibson goodies . Just keep in mind this is n't a top of the line guitar but for the cost , seems to me to be a huge bang for your buck . I can recommend this guitar completely . Edit : Okay , got it home and tuned up , intonation is right on , action is good . The tuners are a little mushy but that 's the only thing I found that I was n't happy with . Will be upgrading them but other than that one item , it 's a heck of a good guitar . Like I said , you get a lot of bang for not a lot of bucks .
5 #### I ordered this BEHRINGER ULTRAGRAPH PRO FBQ3102 to build a sound system for a small church . It works great . I love it so far .
5 #### Plugged in perfectly to my 99 Ford Ranger . Seems to be well made . I have n't had any issues since the install over a year ago .
5 #### Bought this because my IPhone would n't fit in a regular pouch while I had a protective case . This one allows me to protect my phone and still have a nice pouch . The look is very nice and the leather is soft with a nice belt clip . I use this every day .
3 #### this is a handy little stand to keep when out and about , but it 's limited due to it 's plastic construction ; it supports an ipod touch with no problem , but you wo n't be able to set it in portrait orientation with a cable attached . and if you have a couple more accessories attached that add weight to the ipod , the extra weight will cause the stand to buckle under the pressure and it becomes unstable . but if you just need a stand to prop up the ipod by itself , this works just fine .
5 #### Arrived today , fit perfect on my rv spare , looks really nice , dresses it up . Odd feeling type of material , hope it holds up under the summer sun , we'll see .
5 #### Strong music sound , exceptional quality at such a low price . I used these on the beach of Aruba , perfect size , much better than the ear buds .
4 #### I 've been using sony MDR-7506 's for years , for both casual and critical listening , so my ears are quite " tuned " to them . These provide slightly more clarity and definition than the 7506 's , while still retaining the overall sonic character .
5 #### These have been a surprisingly great addition to my small demo studio . They sound crisp and sit in a mix just right with an acoustic guitar and vocals . They are a classic , I would n't bother with any other shaker .
5 #### This has succeeded where others have failed . Not for large areas , but if you 've got a spot or several spots , it will take care of it .
2 #### Latches did n't line up , and case would n't stay shut . Had to return to Amazon , which is a pain due to the size of the box required . On the other hand , if you have a EJ-200 , there are not many hard cases big enough to hild that guitar , so your options are limited .
5 #### Just what we needed . The long cord is perfect . Seems to be very well built .
5 #### Excellent cleaner . Can be used for many other things other than just the K&N air filters .
4 #### Does n't look like its 10 ft long , but its definitely longer than the cable that came stock with my Mark 3 & works great !
5 #### Very nice no frills compact CB . I have had zero issues with mine .
5 #### Guitar arrived on time and in perfect condition . Only the normal minor adjustments were needed : 1 ) the fret edges were sharp and needed to be ground down with Emory board ( manicure file ) 2 ) there was a slight back bow in the neck , so the truss rod had to be adjusted . 3 ) intonation set . These are normal adjustments and are to be expected with the Squier line .
3 #### They work well for a few months , but eventually begin to degrade and damage my VCR heads . Heads should be cleaned often when using these VHS tapes .
4 #### The phone is an excellent phone and all the features work . I have owned four previous to this one . Two were U.S. versions and two foreign versions . The reason I ordered this phone is because U.S. Versions had a few features that the foreign versions did n't and U.S. English was used . This phone is not a U.S. version . It says Chine Mobile on the back and uses British English . So , the advertising is incorrect .
5 #### These strings are a little more money than the average strings , but they last longer . Great for the dedicated guitar player .
5 #### These strings were a great replacement for my ' entry level ' SX Bass . Much better sounding than the originals .
5 #### We bought this external battery pack in anticipation of a LONG ( 28 hour ) trip with our 2 year old to see my wife 's family in Singapore and Malaysia . It was the best purchase we made . I brought my iPod for him to watch movies and some of his favorite TV shows on to pass the time . We also had our cell phones and my wife had her Kindle . With the poor battery life of most of these devices , I knew I needed something to charge them with when there were no accessible power outlets . This device was extremely easy to use and the connectors are great . I have my iPod in a case but it connected without any problems so I could plug it in while our son kept watching Diego . It also charged all the other devices with the included tips . The battery life is amazing . I charged it fully before we left on our trip and it lasted the whole 28 hours with plenty to spare .
5 #### My " wireless " printer had a hard time staying connected to my home network , so I said , screw it , let 's get a cord involved . For saving the day I give it 5 stars
2 #### Did n't seem to make any difference at all . The brushes are teeny - tiny . Really not worth the asking price .
5 #### The best brand for memory cards . Purchased for a special action video camera . Trusted and dependable brand for all cameras .
5 #### I bought this guitar as my second electric at a guitar center for a larger price than it is listed for here . I have to tell you , I am extremely pleased . The action is great for an Epiphone , and the pickups do n't sound cheap in any way . Totally love it .
5 #### Item was shipped as described . Skin matches my phone very nicely . Phone received few scratches which is why I ordered the skin . No scratches since . Would recommend highly ! ! !
4 #### Been using these for 10 years , and i live by them ! ! Absorbs water like no other . A perfect Buy
3 #### I have always used an OEM RIM holster with every Blackberry I 've owned . Never had any problems in the past with durability , but for some reason , the Torch holster just was n't made the same as other models I have owned . Pros : I do like the looks of the holster and the functionality is good as it puts the phone into sleep mode when inserted . It has a professional leather look with the Blackberry branding . Holster clip rotates to put the phone at a comfortable angle . Cons : The glue holding the material on the inside just did n't hold up to the use and after about a month 's worth of use was completely getting pushed into the case when inserting the phone . The holster was also made just a bit too snug . Other models of RIM hosters are snug , but easy enough to slide the phone in and out . The Torch is just a bit too snug . If RIM has changed the design at all from the initial batch of holsters , then this is probably a non - issue . I tend to stick to the OEM because of the professioal look , feel , and fuctionality . Hopefully they do n't let their craftsmanship slide .
1 #### The case is cumbersome and you can not dock the phone without removing the case , which is difficult because it is in three peices . Customer service is a joke .
5 #### Love this kit ... it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths .... make your axe shine and look like a rockstar .
5 #### Like others here , I repaired by electric lawnmower with this rectifier . Ran the mower at a low setting in dense , wet weeds and drew too much current , burned the OEM rectifier out . Quick swap and I was back in business .
2 #### My friend and jam mate bought one of these and yes , It works , sort of , to eliminating some hum , but it cuts the volume too much and sucks some of the life out of your guitar tone . For a little more money , why would you not buy an ISP Decimator 2 ? They work much better at removing hum and keep your guitar tone in all it 's glory . I would image it could be used for other applications , but I would advise against using this for guitar / amp .
5 #### My biggest problem is the SO keeps borrowing this when she takes conference calls at home . OK - second problem . Now I have a USB headset for skype / etc , and a wired headset for cell phones and when traveling ( I usually do n't bring the USB headset - too fragile ) . So now my nest of wires has gotten a little worse . Generally I do n't like the quality / reliability of bluetooth , but I may try again in the next few months .
5 #### Works great . Help protect the Bluetooth while not in use . Practical case .
4 #### Not a pro sax player but for past 12 years have been playing several hours every week contemporary praise and worship in non - denominational churches . I always liked Rico Royals from the old high school band days . These plastic coated Rico reeds are great . You do n't have to soak them before playing so they never get over - saturated . Just a quick lick to make the mouthpiece seal and they are ready to play . You can put the horn down for an hour or two and pick it up and begin playing immediately since they do n't dry out either . Also , the plastic surface is much smoother on the lip so you do n't get the big lip callous like you do with uncoated reeds . Great sound too , at least I think so .
4 #### Overall it does its job . I had trouble with it sticking to the cinder block walls , I found an alternative .
3 #### this item met all my expectations . I am very pleased with my purchase It has fulfilled the need and reason for purchase .
5 #### I was wary of trying coated strings ( had heard from several players that they did n't like the " feel " ) , but after trying these I 'm sure glad I did ! I 've been using a set on one of my guitars for at least 4 months now , and after playing at least 4 times a week for at least an hour or two , the strings sound nearly as good as the day I first strung them . I 'm a believer !
5 #### This was the perfect " companion purchase " to the McGard 74018 Marine Single Stern Drive Lock Set . This was purchased to deter thieves from stealing the propeller while the boat is in transit cross - country and even while sitting vulnerable in a storage yard or side yard of a residence . Thieves like to take things easily that do n't belong to them so they can take them to recycling yards for quick cash . Why let yourself become a victim !
5 #### Works as advertised , Looks Great on the Black Trim . Its Lasted a Few weeks now in our Rain Winter . Engine looks like New . The Cost should be 5 bucks , I 'm trying to find Local . Will use it again . Glad I found it . Tried it on some inside trim . I was carefull to get no over spray .
5 #### Got them for My Wife . She 's the drummer in the Family .
5 #### Not much to say , the earpiece does what it is meant to do . Easy to pair with devices , holds a charge well , the flip on / off function is nice , and it easily fits on my ear without plugging it .
5 #### So far so good . Functions as good as the OEM .
5 #### works great . i like the LED to know that it 's plugged in and powered up properly
5 #### I am enjoying my phone . I is working very good except that sending a voicemail with the viber add it 's not going through but differently it 's working perfect so far .
5 #### After looking for the " right " phone holder for my new truck , I took a chance on this one(actually two ) . I did n't want to screw anything or glue anything into my new truck , wanted a easy in and out holder . This holder is heavy duty . Has an nice adjustable for size cup holder mount system , simple but super solid . Flexible arm is heavy duty , hard to flex but once set is good to go . Head swivels as well . Adjustable for different phone , works great with my LG LS720 . I have RAM 1500 2012 . Also works great in PT Cruiser , 2012 Wrangler Unlimited . Great holder for price
5 #### These are so comfortable and lightweight . Miss the added feature of volume control though . Should have looked for that 1st , but it 's ok
5 #### I 've used these strings for years , and they have always delivered .
5 #### I just got these in the mail today . I wanted something cheap with decent quality . The sound quality from these headphones is amazing . I ca n't attest to the durability of them since I just got them , but wow , the sound is crystal clear with great highs and lows and no distortion . They are kind of dorky looking though .
2 #### I bought this unit thinking that it would connect to the video in source in my truck so my kids could watch video 's that are stored on my phone or my wife 's iphone which it does . The thing I was also hoping for was a powered option as the video out is normally a power drainer for the devices and I ca n't figure out how to use the supplied USB power cord to do that . The connection end on the USB cable that should go into the Adapter that connects to the phone is way too loose not sure if it is even the right type as it is that loose . Also that connection end has a blue plastic covering that is a like a plastic tip with some metal contacts that are very loose and just does n't do anything for charging as I can tell . This works GREAT for video out and I have had no issues , sound and video were great in my truck and for the price it is a steal , better if I can figure out how to charge the unit with it but still worth it ...
5 #### I travel and use my Blackberry as an alarm clock . This charger is very handy and allows my phone to sit upright which puts it in to clock mode . ( A very neat feature . ) This allows me to see the time in the middle of the night or when the alarm goes off . No more trying to locate the phone in an unfamiliar darkened room .
5 #### Cheap strings , but work fine . I have no complaints whatsoever .
5 #### This definitely did seem a bit stronger than the other brand brake parts cleaners .
5 #### if you love to record music from cd 's or the radio , & do n't want to pay an arm & a leg for good quality tapes , these are for you ! i have bought 3 ' 15 ' count packages of them so far . i m very happy . i intend to buy more .
5 #### Got them for a friend and he loves them . He uses them every day . Feels good that I can find quality at a great price .
4 #### Combined with a screen protector ; it is pretty good . The rubber ' gasket ' is starting to swell ; though for a case under $ 10 , I expect it . Good fall protection too .
4 #### This EQ adds a good sound quality to my system . Easy to connect and adjust . Channel slides feels a little cheap and flimzy but over all I am pleased .
5 #### Bought these after the cord went bad on some Koss UR10 headphones I was using with my ipod while I excercise . To me the Panasonic headphones sound as good or better than the Koss , they also weigh less and are more comfortable , and durable . Only minor negative so far is the cord seems a little longer than it needs to be .
5 #### My son got these sticks and he says that they are tough and durable . If a person craves for big and durable sticks , look no further then Vic Firth Rock Nylon .
5 #### Great for protection from rocks and other debris that may ding up or ruin the lens .. Plus they look good and attach pretty firmly .
5 #### This has truly left my tires shine for longer than any other such product I have used before ; it is lasting . It will even retain sheen after driving in moderate rainfall . I definitely can recommend this product it is money well spent . I have bought more since my initial purchase
5 #### I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon . I used it on a brand new ball glove and it seems to work very well . I 'm used to heavier glove oils that soak into the glove . This is much different . It seems to condition the leather but not leave it soaked like regular glove oil . Application is a bit tricky however . This product is very runny and seems to be best applied with a sponge or rag . Anything left over can be wiped off after . However my experience is that the product conditions the leather without saturating it especially if the leather is dry . Overall a solid product and highly recommended by most leather professionals .
3 #### Product does what it is suppose to but I was buying also because the picture showed a smaller connector that goes into the iPhone . This way I could keep on my iPhone case . With this product have to remove the case to use the cable because the connector is much wider than the normal Apple connector
5 #### Very good protection . Does n't slip in your hand . The only thing I would recommend is a screen protector . I use several different cases for my iPhone and this looks more expensive than it is .
5 #### Works just fine . The safety pin is a nice added piece of mind but the stands are very sturdy
5 #### Works like a wonder to remove the water after cleaning my car . The chamois cleans in the washing machine , and stores in the container it comes in . I keep two in my car at all times . Will buy more ... if they ever wear out !
4 #### Good product , But I 'm not happy with the screws to attach the mud flaps with seems to be a industry wide problem , cheap screw material , it only been about six month and I 've got to change them out , I would be more then happy to pay a dollar or two more for quality all weather fastener , its do not make sense to me to sale a out door Item and provide inside fastener or non weather proof type fasteners , I do n't no maybe its just me .
5 #### This phone , although 10 years old at this point , is still a great phone , it was light - years ahead of itself . I still use it as my international phone when I travel to Israel . I put an Israeli SIM card in it and it works great . Its amazing how long these old phone batteries really lasted for . I can go 5 days easily on this phone without needing to charge it , even with normal usage . I did n't like that it was hot pink , but at $ 50 this phone was cheaper than any other Amazon offered , so I just got a case and covered up the pink . Definitely worth the money if you need an international phone while on vacation
5 #### Works great and looks good . I originally purchased this as a small snake but it ended up as patch cords .
5 #### no big issues with this , i 've bought many , many screen protectors because well you can never have enough ! they are so handy and i tend to pass them out like gum , but hey for the price that they are it is what it is , easy to use and assemble
5 #### I purchased this lens at the same time of buying my Canon T1s .... I by no means am anything but an amateur photographer at this point , and with that said , this lens has been great for me .... I do n't care that it 's noisier than the included 18 - 55 lens , and I 've taken some fantastic fully zoomed in pictures with this lens , I have seen no indication of unfocused results ... If you 're a " pro " and you are buying a $ 150 lens and expecting $ 800 results , you might want to revisit your expectations :-)
5 #### Works just as good as the Icon HD I had , it was a refurbished one and the battery gave out .
5 #### I ordered mine for HTC EVO . The quality was better than I expected . Most of the silicone covers have a wide opening in the back for flash , camera & speaker . But the one I got , has 3 small individual opening for each of the 3 above , adds more protection . It does not smell like some other silicon skins that I have seen . Just be careful which amazon seller you buy it from .
5 #### Perfect fit to replace the OEM stereo in our 99 Silverado with a new Pioneer ... kiddo just has to have the aux jack and bluetooth ! ! Worked well with no hassles ...
5 #### Install was a snap . Took about 10 minutes per side on my 03 F-250 . Quality looks much better than stock which the dealer wanted $ 300 just for one . Hopefully will last through some abuse while plowing . Make sure you tighten the screws TIGHT . I lost one in the first 25 miles of driving . Update 3/13 After 4 years of plowing commercially with these , this this year over 100 " of snow . Both sides look as good as the day I installed them . Great product . Would buy again and I recommend them to everyone .
5 #### The Epiphone Case is the very best in quality case available for your Les Paul . From the soft plush interior , ( which provides a " snug fit " for your Les Paul preventing it from sliding around inside ) , to the strong construction of the case body , your guitar is protected . The case is covered in a durable leather like covering with the Epiphone name in gold on the top . It 's hinged hardware and latches are very well made , with one having a keyed lock to help keep your instrument safe . The outer top of the case is slightly domed to provide even more strength , dispursing the energy from an inpact out toward the sides , away from the guitar inside . A soft padded handle set at just the right balance point makes it comfortable to carry . I have cases made by others , but none compare to this case . Some of those others have put such little thought into their cases , that they actually have an aluminum edge around the top and bottom of the opening . One careless moment with these , and your guitar is going to have an imprint that will be there as long as the guitar .
4 #### You got ta have this if you 're serious about flash photography . It makes a world of difference . If you 're using your strobes on a stand you 'll need a longer cord than the base model . My next one will be longer , but this model is good for things like hand held off camera shooting or for using with camera grips like the stroboframe .
5 #### No need for a purse when I go out , just use this folio to allow me to carry my phone , credit cards and i d for simple trips to restaurants or movies .
4 #### Have it for around a month and seems to be working very well . It is secure in the car and is a really reasonable price .
5 #### bought this for my son 's Triton LG , it is very soft and covers the phone perfectly !
3 #### Received this shipment quickly , I am using this however it does not fit securely in my iPad . It comes out really easy and connection is not that good but better than some others I have ordered .
5 #### I purchased this set / pair for my 2016 toyota T4R. these I installed on the front as the OEM mud guards are too short . mud / debris shooting up on the running boards . so I used a piece of card board as a copy of these mud guards and using the OEM mud guards drilled holes into the card board then installed on vehicle . this then was set to provide a 7 inch drop compared to the 4 inch drop of the toyota guards this then matched the rear guards which also had a 7inch drop . took off the cardboard pattern then drilled out the holes used the OEM fasteners and its perfect . I have now on my 16 yr old truck the same type product fiber glass reinforced guards and they still look good . they do flex but not too much .
1 #### I know it 's less than $ 2.00 but it should come in flat .. not curved .... :-( so it will stay on .. Not usable ... would like a replacment ...
5 #### I bought these for my Jawbone and it makes my Jawbone so much better and functional . It gives you a choice of three sizes ( one of each size per ear ) . I thought they worked great and really helped keep the sound in my ear . The did move on the Jawbone a bit but I could fix that with a little glue if I wanted .
5 #### These lights are awesome ! I mounted these KC Slims to my Smittybilt front bumpers . I had to make custom bracket mounts for these lights so that i can tilt them down a bit for street use . Instead of just zip ties to tie down the wires , I ran the wires through my Smittybilt front bumper for a clean finish and used heat shrink wire martial to protect the exposed wires . The KC SlimLite Fogs works great with my stock OEM Fog lights . I chose the fog lights over the driving lights because the fog lights are way brighter and the light cuts through dense fog which driving lights ca n't do ( multi purpose ) . Super bright super Clean and street legal . Would mosdef recommend !
5 #### Elixir Strings 11182 80/20 Bronze with NANOWEB Coating Acoustic Guitar Strings , HD Light Gauge , offer a great balance of sound while strumming chords or playing individual notes . There 's a lot less squeaking going on as my fingers slide on the strings ( so my cats are confused thinking there are mice hiding somewhere ) . With a bolder sounding low end , my guitar has a warmer sound to it . The highs are more sparkling than shrill . These strings feel great too ! I love the idea of them being a longer lasting . Less time changing strings and more time playing !
5 #### Excellent headphones with good sound for such a small package . I like open air sound a lot from these . Not good for loud environment though , as you 'll hear everything that is going on around you .
1 #### Does not work with iPad , disappointed with product . I do not recommend it . I would like to return this product .
4 #### If you 're like me & you 've just spent $ $ on a nice SLR / D - SLR camera ; you want a nice protective bag for your kit , but do n't have a lot of spare $ $ to spend on it . This bag is well designed , seems well made , and is low priced . It has storage space for your camera & 2 lenses , as well as some additional compartments that are perfect for spare batteries , SD Cards , external flash , filters , and an external flash . I think it 's a great value for the money , even if you end up getting several lenses down the road & need to replace it with a bigger bag . If you do n't see yourself having more than what 's already been mentioned then this bag will fit the bill for you long - term as well .
3 #### I bought this item to replace the original headset for my V3i . PROs : It does the job . CONs : Line is too short : I have to hold the phone in my hand or around my neck while using it . The line from the original headset was longer and I can put the phone in my pocket . Poor sound quality for music : Sound is muffled ... it sounded like a cheap wma compression . The original headset sounded better . I guess you get what you paid for .
5 #### Still using the same one for over a year now .
5 #### Works great in a thinkpad t450s , using as boot drive . Concerned about long term reliability due to some reviews here , will update review if any problems occur . There is a 3 year warranty and its a US based company so I wo n't loose much sleep if something happens ( since I backup )
5 #### Item condition and functionality were exactly as advertised . Shipping time was standard and expected .
5 #### This extension cord frees up space without any sacrifice in quality . I am ordering another one .
5 #### After a couple of cheap grease guns , I opted for this better one . It 's definitely heavy duty , worth a few extra bucks , quality throughout . Comes with everything I need . This is the one I pick up every time I need a grease gun .
5 #### i had some scratch cd and this help it alot
2 #### Purchased two of these to ensure bonding for Mercedes Hood Insulation Pad . Found only needed one . The item description does not mention that the unused can can not be returned due to shipping restrictions . This should have been indicated in the product text somewhere . Product worked great but shipping policy is a failure .
5 #### This license plate holder I put in front instead of back because it looks to good to hide in back . I purchased the Honda logo caps to go along with plate frame . I get a lot of comments on appearance and people asking me if its factory like back plate holder !
1 #### could n't hold on to my s8 + . gravity just slid it straight through the open bottom
5 #### Works great has ports for a great price ! I wish it had POE capability but then again you get what you pay for . Solid construction with a nice feel to it .
4 #### I guess it 's okay . The VCR I used it on had to be professionally cleaned . If your unit is n't that bad and you keep up with cleaning it , it should work well .
3 #### It does the job , I do wish you could take the bike rack off without having to take the tightener off or there was an easier way to take the tightener off . Maybe a latch design , b / c you have to carry a wrench with you if you want to take it off at your destination . That being said , I knew that when I was buying it . The rack does n't rattle like it did before so it does the job . Fit 's a little weird on my hitch b / c there 's a " lip " around the edge of my hitch and the tightener has to fir underneath / around it but it works .
4 #### Elixir Strings give a good tone and last longer than any other stings I 've bought . Whether I 'm playing Rock or Country these strings give me the tone I need . Shipping was super fast as I used the regular shipping so I got them a couple days before I expected .
2 #### Although the quality of the screen protector seems good , it is very difficult to apply . Bubbles are n't impossible but it 's not easy getting rid of them once a few small ones slip in . Lint also gets in but some scotch tape solves that . Will be returning this .
1 #### Well , I should have listened to the bad reviews . This is flimsy . It 's just not stable enough to hold up my guitar neck while I do string changes , cleaning , maintenance , etc . I used it a few times and it 's too frustrating . Good idea , and nice design ( the folding up is great for storage ) . But not good execution . This is a cheap - feeling plastic and is too light to adequately support my guitar . I opted to buy a " shooting bag " that rifle shooters use to hold up their guns while they lie on the ground and target shoot . It 's non - slip , soft , heavy , and the right height to support the guitar neck . It 's really a much better alternative . Here is the one I bought , Primos Group Therapy Rear Shooting Bag http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BD4UAU2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
1 #### piece of crap takes 10 seconds to trigger , stays on for 2 seconds , then turns off . what a damn waste of money
4 #### Good jack stands at a low price for home use on standard vehicles . The welding is poor but the stands hold up well , and it 's nice having the double lock feature .
4 #### I purchased this product based on other customer reviews and the price . Arrived on time , and it installed easily without any problem . I have had it for about 2 months now and it is still working great . Good product for the price !
5 #### I had this stereo 3 years before I sold it . Great CD player , great cassette recorder , and great radio . The CD player did n't skip , and the cassette player made great recordings . Both the G500 and the ZW755 are great systems , but the cassette player is better on the ZW755 , partly because it was a duoble deck and you could record off of the other deck . This is a great portable unit ! Way to go Sony !
3 #### It gets the job done ... Not a lot to say about it other than that . I was hoping this would fit as an alternative to the LifeProof headset connector so that I could use it in my car aux - in without having to screw and unscrew it each time . The cable shielding on this is n't small enough for that , but I was able to trim it down to do the job . I am not sure how long it will last , but until then it works .
5 #### Nice and sturdy , been using for 2 years without issue
4 #### Better than expected . Looks great in my black 2015 Nissan Versa . The only minor problem that I have is that the mat does n't rest completely flush on the driver 's side where the left foot rests but not enough to affect driving . High quality mats with no noticeable odor like other mats that I 've had in the past .
5 #### I have some expensive guitars and I do alot of on stage trading during sets . In the past I have almost dropped some of my investments because the strap worked it 's way off the factory posts and I did n't realize it . These Straplok things are the real deal ... I put them on every one of my guitars now .
5 #### I just got this case ... but I have another one of the same brand . This is a good hard guitar case . Price is ok ... but I wanted one to store my guitar in when not using .. or if I transport this on an airplane . It comes with a key if you need to lock it up ... The quality of the case is great .. nice and strong for a hard case . My small Baby Taylor BT2 , which is a 3/4 guitar , fits in here perfectly .... would recommend this case to anyone looking for a small guitar case ..
5 #### The blanket warms up fast . I got the blanket so I would n't have to use the heater so much during the winter and it worked well all winter . The only thing I would recommend is that if you 're tall and you want your upper and lower body to both be covered , to get two of the blankets .
5 #### I broke the plastic on my stock f250 hubs while pulling another vehicle out of the snow luckily I got out still . I received these and am very impressed with the build quality and look of these . I am very confident that no matter how much abuse I put these through I wo n't be having any issues with them .
5 #### This battery really helped my Optimus , which was not longer full of zip in function OR battery life . The new battery fit well , the back provided exactly the support needed , and the phone was MUCH better with the extended life battery . The only flaw as that my handy rubber case no longer fit . BUT the better performance made it worth it !
5 #### I have a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado that I installed the K & N system on when I first bought it . I still have the orginial K & N filter after 184,000 miles and all I have done is clean it once a year with this kit .
5 #### brighter & longer lasting than the teak oil I had been using for decades . . . AND CHEAPER TOO . . . it was the pricing that got me to try this product & I found it far superior to the brand sold at west marine . . . have switched my wax and cleaner to Meguiars too and have been very satisfied with the results . . . thank you . . .
4 #### The recorder works great and meets my needs . It is easy to see the tape , has good quality , and the price was not bad considering how the demand has gone down . The only disappointment was an external mic was mentioned in the ad but not included . I do realize there was no claim it would be but since cheap tape recorders have included the external mic this was hard to understand .
4 #### Very handy tool . Cheap , too ! Built well . Should last a lifetime
2 #### I bought this due to the many people commenting on how nice of a case this was when they put it on their phones . Well , it is a nice case when on as it fits extremely tight and has a very nice velvety feel to it . However , when I tried to remove it ( as I was swayed by another reviewer who said she or he simply slid their finger under the obvious slot under the power button and " pop - a - rini " it popped right off ..... no pop - a - rini easy openee ... This case was very difficult to pry off as I ended up using a screwdriver with a towel wrapped around it as to not damage the expensive smart phone inside . I think the few people lucky enough to have removed this thing without issue were just that ..... lucky . Lucky for me at this price it will be going in the garbage .
5 #### I do n't know why the prior reviewers had problems with this drive . I have had one in my PowerMac ( running off a Sonnet ATA/66 card ) for over 9 months and have had 0 problems . I got it to replace a pair of Maxtor 's that jsut were n't up to snuff for video editng ( Final Cut Pro ) . I 've never had an error or dropped frame due to this drive .
4 #### Pretty basic folks , but be aware , only the fuse holder and a length of 12AWG wire is included . Looks like better than average quality .
3 #### I guess its ok in a pinch . But I ca n't get radio station signals in most area 's and get a lot of static if I do n't play with the position . Also , do n't expect to plug in your stereo headset and hear stereo .. you 'll only hear from one ear even if your on the FM dial .
4 #### The Bluetooth headset is nicely constructed , confirmable , has a nice off & on by flipping the mouth piece back over the ear piece , appears to stay charged . Once in a while you may get a little static , that could be from the other persons phone , but , for the money it works good . If you want a Bluetooth that works and one that you do not have to take a bank loan out to purchase it , this could be the one for you too . I purchased one that cost a lot more and it had static and people said it sounded like I was talking in a can . That 's in a clear bag waiting to give to someone I like ? The best Bluetooth I had was a Emerson that I purchased at a Aldi Food store , ( $ 14 . ) worked for years until the battery went dead .
2 #### It is more orange than red , this is for the older version 4 . The rubber tabs are a pain . Was easy to hold though . Big hands will like the size .
3 #### For a first " smart phone " it 's okay . Little too thick , but it 's an old model . Nokia OS it 's crap and slow . Small keyboard . Signal is great , internet navigation kind of crapy .
5 #### The only brand of strings I buy , will buy , and continue to buy . They sound great and last a long time with a similar tone for the life of the string , and the price is excellent for the value !
5 #### As usual the picks are great , AND seem easier to find when I drop them on the floor !
5 #### I 've been listening to these for years and years . For the price they are simply amazing . Great bass response . Crystal clear highs . Wonderful for all kinds of music : pop , rock , jazz , classical , soundtracks . I actively go out and listen to the competition all the time . I did just order the Sennheister Px 100s because evidently they edge past the Koss headphones . I find this hard to believe , but we 'll see . I do love the Bose Q2 's and plan to get those for home and travel . But when it comes to serious street bopping : for the Koss . You will not be sorry ! ! Promise .
5 #### This works great for extending out of my lifeproof case . No problems or issues after 9 months of occasional use .
4 #### It worked well with my solar power setup , it appears to be heavy duty . Good Luck
5 #### Wife bought these for her ride . Product arrived on time as expected . The floor mats have nice deep channels and the logo is crisp white . Highly recommend for all those cow girls out there .
4 #### Glad to find this case through Amazon . Sprint did n't sell any custom cases for this phone and for $ 300 I wanted to make sure it 's protected . The two pieces fit snugly and still allow access to all the buttons , stylus and holes for microphones and speakers and not interfere with the sliding / tilt of the screen . It 's a little tough to get the case off to clean out dust or if you need to access the battery door . I had to reset my phone and thought I was going to break the small plastic tabs when I tried to get the case off to access the battery door . I liked the swivel belt clip but since it has the screen facing out I was afraid I 'd bump into something and end up damaging the screen . I liked being able to take off the clip attachment and insert the plug so that there 's no hole in the back . It allows me to slip it into my pocket or bag without the nub catching on things or having a hole collect lint / dust . The case adds a bit of bulk to an already thick phone , but the phone feels so much more secure / protected in the case . The texture gives you a good grip on the phone and it feels padded enough to survive accidental bumps and drops .
5 #### This vendor 's shipping speed in unbelievable . It arrived the second day After I ordered it . I see no visible delay with this 100 ft Cat cable .
5 #### This product is as advertised . It gives you a lot of versitility in that you can carry just one insert / pole and the three balls . It will handle almost any trailer that an average person will own or rent . I highly recommend it .
5 #### This adhered well to the rusty rock chips I had to repair on my car . It 's more of a paint - like material than other rust repair products so it does n't visibly turn the rust black like them but after two coats and curing for 24 hours as the directions said I could not get it to flake off and reveal the rust again which is a good sign . I covered it with a color - match touch - up paint . Only time will tell how well it inhibits further rust but so far I am thrilled .
4 #### Handy tool . I was able to change a complete set of strings in less than 7 minutes ( including tuning ) using this gadget ! I gave it 4 - stars instead of 5 because it is NOT made in America ... can't give a perfect score unless Americans made it !
3 #### Be careful how tight you make the screws . I easily stripped out one of the small ones . Fits perfectly into a 3rd generation Toyota 4Runner below a standard size radio using the factory steel mounting bracket . I used the smaller of the two adapters ( the pieces with many holes rather than just 3 holes ) . The faceplates are also pretty flimsy , but one did work ( the smallest one ) . Product picture shows slots for cd cases , mine did n't have them , which is ok with me because who uses jewel cases anymore ?
3 #### They work well , but you 're really better off bringing your struts into a shop , spending a little cash and having professionals do it for you . It 's a lot of work , it 's potentially VERY dangerous , and you want it done right ; But if your set on trying to bust your knuckles , these will work with a little sweat and elbow grease .
3 #### Love the sound hate the quality . I have purchased about 10 pairs of these and the wire inevitably wears and breaks near the outlet of the earphone . If they replaced their cheap rubber strain relief with a longer silicon strain relieve they would probably last much longer . I found I can extend the life by adding some flexible glue over the strain relief when I first receive them but still find they break sooner than my jbud or memorex units which are cheaper . With that said part of my commute requires walking under and next to some very noisy highways . These earphones are the only units I have ever tested that allow comfortable listening the entire way . They are also the best I have found for use on airplanes because they block the ambient sound so well . I do find that after a couple hours of use that the pressure from the foam becomes uncomfortable so I tend to reserve them for use in noisy environments .
5 #### I have been using this battery for over a year now and it still works perfect .
5 #### Even though the picture is an earlier iPhone , I assumed it was compatible with all of them . It 's not . I guess on earlier iPhones the speaker was on the other side . Also , there is no adapter to hold it into the doc for the 4 + ; it just slips off if you try it . I see now there is a link to a newer version for iPhone 4 + ( GC10038 ) , so use that if you have 4 . The folks were good enough to refund me the cost -- just wanted to let others know . I gave it 5 stars because I tested the amplification by holding the 4 in reverse , and it definitely works . Just a minor issue with the Amazon page not making it clearer -- should be in the title , IMO .
4 #### I 'll keep it short and simple . The price is the best in town and no problems when connected from my modem to the computer . The packaging was the usual plastic bubble over a piece of cardboard ... the good news is the plastic bubble was easily removed from the cardboard without having to spend the better part of a day getting through the packaging . This ease of access to the product is a rare commodity . Most manufacturers seem to think packaging ( especially for electronic items and toys ) should be a test of endurance with possibly slicing off one 's fingers to remove the product from the packaging . Highly recommended for its low price , no operational problems when installed , and ease of removing item from packaging . Update to above review : I went to move my laptop from my desk to use it as a true off line laptop ( no internet connection ) . Removing the cable from the ethernet jack was difficult . It was a bit of a fight to unplug the cable . I 'm all for good tight conectivity but not so tight that the cable is hard to remove . When I connected the cable again it required a bit of force for the cable to lock into place . No problem if the cable is permanently connected but it 's enough of a problem to reduce a five star rating to a four star .
4 #### I 'm hard on my cell phones and this case has saved my iPhone numerous times . Dropping it on concrete , asphalt , and into puddles . It 's not waterproof and I do n't want to test it that way , but for someone who wants to take their expensive iPhone outdoors , like for geocaching or bike riding , this case is perfect . Buy something else if you want Bling on your iPhone case , this one is just plain rugged .
2 #### the instructions included were bad , I ended up cracking the LCD screen , selling the broken phone and buying a newer model .
5 #### HDMI in a very nice and rugged cable . This one has a " male " end at both ends to connect many different items . I bought this to connect our Fire TV box to the switching receiver . Works great . Do n't be hesitant about buying the Amazon Brand of cables , chargers , and etc . Amazon is great about returns and quality of their products . I recommend them and will buy them again in the future .
4 #### This item is a 2 piece case . One is a tight fitting smooth sleeve that hugs the phone and then the 2nd piece goes over it that protects the edges and the buttons . First I thought that the fitting was loose , but after using it for a while it feels very secure . I personally like the 2piece design . I think it also included a tiny micro fiber cleaning cloth .
5 #### Went on in under 10 minutes like it said . One of the fasteners did n't go on right but I do n't think it was the products fault . Probably mine or the hood 's design .
5 #### After a series of poor - quality cases purchased at the Verizon store , I picked this unit up . I wanted something that would protect the phone from a slight fall , but not be so thick as to keep it from being used with a belt pouch . This is the case .... it 's high quality , nicely covered with a leather - like substance , and provides a full hard plastic cover for the vulnerable sides and back of the phone . I liked it so much that when I wore out the first one ( I pull the phone in and out of the pouch a lot ) , I purchased two more .... one to use , another as a spare . Good product !
4 #### These are great to have in the studio or rehearsal space for backup picks and for special applications . I imagine these would be great for people that like to use picks on a bass ; however , I do not condone such behavior , ever ! ; P These are thicker than the green Tortex picks and are also good for lead electric guitar and mandolin ( imo ) .
5 #### Purchased this cable for my Brother HL-2270DW Compact Laser Printer with Wireless Networking and Duplex . I noticed a lot of amazon reviews stating the Brother Printer had issues with the wireless network . So i decided to buy the cable . The cable works great and I have no issues .
5 #### Great pedal , the gold standard of 90 's distortion . Love the black anniversary casing , it sounds just as good as my original but with a lot less ' junk ' in the signal from years of abuse .
5 #### Excellent sounding and unbeatable price . I use this cymbal for a crash and it 's tones sound more like a crash than a splash . Highly recommended for a crash and durable too !
5 #### These are the friggin ' bee 's knees . My review sucks , but other people wrote most insightful comments ; read their reviews .
5 #### I 've had the Treo 650 for months , and agree with most other raters that it had problems . It reset spontaneously , had 50 % less usable memory than the 600 and the phone quality was not as good . Palmone has updated the ROM now and fixed all these problems . My usable memory went from 5 mb to almost 11 mb , and the phone is now completely stable . No need for reservations anymore . The ROM update is not yet available for Cingular , but will be , I suppose , eventually .
4 #### What s blue- 3 ' long and filled with bits of wire- yeah , stupid joke but this thing works as advertised Yep
5 #### On time and as advertised . Perfect for what I need .
5 #### I just reskinned my Yamaha drums with these Evans G2 's . What a big difference . The tone is focused , powerful , with no nasty overtones . I do n't even use my damper rings on these . They just sound great and I ca n't stop playing them . ( I 'm typing this one handed as I pound out a beat . " ;-)
5 #### This works great for keeping a grip on the pick and has a pleasant pine smell . A dab rubbed in and wait a few moments and it becomes quite tacky .
1 #### I have n't order this hood scoop but I noticed something suspicious . The photos advertising this hood scoop is misleading . It shows two different photos of two different hood scoops . The main photo is completely different then the second photo . I ordered the double hood scoops that are shown in the second photo and they fit my S10 . But when I went to see if the single hood scoop in the main photo would fit my truck it says it does n't fit . I would be careful for anyone wanting to buy this hood scoop . You might get ripped off .
5 #### Fits in my gigbag , holds any on my three guitars .
2 #### had to adapt it to get it to work on a longer stud
5 #### I purchased two of these chargers for use on autos that are stored several months each year . They are performing better than higher priced chargers previously used !
5 #### To my ear , the Elixir 80/20 Nanoweb strings sound great . Pretty typical of 80/20 strings they need to break in before they start to sound warm and not metallic . I suspect the nanoweb is what makes them squeak less . Guitar strings last forever on my guitars . They usually break and then I change them so I 'm not a good judge of longevity .
2 #### Second one I bought gave out faster the the first one had it less than two weeks and it just stopped working . When it did work it worked well that 's the only reason there 's two stars
5 #### I bought this product to mount in a motorcycle helmet . It was easy to take apart and works great . Now I can jam to tunes with quality sound including decent bass response . I paired it to a Scala Rider G4 .
5 #### These are great headphones . Lightweight , sound great even at a lower volume , good design especially at the plug end . I would recommend these to anyone who is using headphones and wants a superlative experience .
3 #### I puchased this manual thinking that I can now work on my entire vehicle and do my own repairs . Unfortunately there are some missing instructions in this manual that leave it little to be desired . It give you details on a specific procedure but if there are other step embedded within a certain process , that is not referenced or easily found . So you are left trying to figure out where to find instructions for something is only part of what you wanted to accomplish . I hope there are other manuals out there that show more detail .
5 #### For professional use , this is where to put your money . Unfortunately , these are no longer being manufactured . That stinks . I would like these to be around forever .
5 #### Great charger , good for an auto battery when the car sits for long periods . Also great for 4 wheeler , and other equipment that sit for long periods . I installed this one on a dump trailer so it keeps the battery charged .
5 #### These mud flaps look great , are easy to install ( had to use a small angle driver on the rear flaps to avoid removing the rear tires ) and hang straight but are flexible enough to move if confronted with a parking lot bumper or the like . They give my SuperDuty that big truck look .
5 #### I am very happy with strings they sound great and have a great price
5 #### this item made my new headunit easy to install . price is 75 % cheeper then all audio stores in my area .
3 #### A little expensive to print labels but amazon was one of the few places that had these available . Work just fine .
4 #### Bought this for our semi truck that we only use occasionally . These have good range for the price , Range varies according to terrain and conditions . But , listening range on a flat surface is easily 2 1/2 to 3 miles . Easy to use and comfortable to handle .
1 #### Used in a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 since May 2014 . Card went into a " read - only " state with no way to reverse sometime in August 2015 ; noticed issues after photos started getting erratically corrupted and would seemingly disappear after several days ( power cycle ) . Phone would n't write to card , computer was n't able to format , and no device other than the phone was able to read the filesystem . This is apparently a common problem with SanDisk 's earlier batches of this card , but this is the third SanDisk storage solution I 've had fail on me in the past two years and I wo n't be coming back .
5 #### these work great on my gm vehicle If you need new hingpins for your gm vehicle then I highly recomend theses .
5 #### I have to say this was the best money I have spent so far . The case fits perfect , the screen protector was almost exact . One edge of the protector was a bit to big and left a small bubble on the top conner . this was not a problem because the case covers that and is unseen .
1 #### Piece of crap . The plastic ends are too soft to press hard enough on the tablet to work . These were cheap , and I got what I paid for . Also , the listing indicated two to three months for shipping , which I thought was a misprint , but it was n't . You 'd be better of using the eraser end of a number 2 pencil than this garbage . Buy a different pen !
5 #### I 've been using this brand on my BMW for the past 11 years . Wheel cleaner really cuts through the brake dust and road grime with ease . I like that you do n't have to wait for the wax to haze up before removing . You can wipe it off as soon as you apply it . Only thing I wish this kit had was a clay bar to make it a complete cleaning system .
5 #### this drum head here , THIS DRUM HEAD RIGHT HERE ! WOW ! will sound A - MAZING in a recording . It cuts out any overtones and will get the purest sound from your snare possible . I do n't recommend this snare for venues unless you 're mic'd up , its a little to dry for live settings , but it will still be heard , as the descriptions says it will bark live , and it sure does bark but could use a little more bite , if you know what I mean . I 've used this head on every snare for recording and it just sings and will give back to you every time .
4 #### This item was purchased to use with my portable speakers and Apple iPod while away on business or travel , it has worked out great .
5 #### My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie . I loved it . It 's a switchless pedal that I put through hell . I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke . It 's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal " open " to achieve a certain warm sound . That 's when I went looking at the cry baby . At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up . I put this one against the Hendrix , Classic , and 95 - Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best . The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $ 200 it was out of my price range . I paid $ 97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny . I do n't even touch my Morley anymore . It 's cry baby all the way
5 #### Works well as a cable . I use this as an extension from my basement to my TV in the living room
5 #### This stuff just works ! Follow the instructions and run cleaner , leaner , with better performance , and mileage .
5 #### For those who are not sure about Elixers : Next time you change strings , put one wound string from a non Elixer set along with 5 Elixers and within ten days or so that one string will sound dead compared to the others . Other strings might sound better to you for the first day or so , but it 's the long term benefit that I love . I play more than most folks and yet only need to change strings about two to three times a year . I 've only had one break in the last ten years . I 've tried other coated strings but these are much better .
4 #### I have a fairly new car and unlike my old heavily used mini - van , this one can continue to look new as long as I take good care of it . I like to use the car wash vacuums because they have such good suction . But in between visits , this is fairly good for quick touch ups . I really like the crevice tool because it gets in between the seats especially on the sides of the driver and passenger seats where all kinds of things fall down . The suction is moderate and it has a harder time getting things like dry grass out of the carpet . It is no comparison to a car wash vacuum but it does what you would think for a smaller hand - held . It runs off your car battery ( convenient ) and has a couple of attachments , an easy to clean collection area and a carry bag for all the parts . Sample provided for review .
5 #### i put this in with my order of the whole spend over this much and free shipping got these for like 3 $ at the time very good head phones a little stiff at first but it feels better now
5 #### this thing worked great idk how long it will last but for the money i ca nt complain it looks just like the picture made well
5 #### What to say ............... it 's a Savarez . The best ones just behind Hannabach for me . Have beening using just they for sometime now .
2 #### They do n't charge my G4 very good if the battery is less than 60 % and ca n't use the device while charging using the cable or it just wo n't charge . ( I bout 3
5 #### I already owned an external battery from this company . Had it two years and it 's still working great so when I saw they had a smaller unit , I bought two . These are smaller than my iPhone and iPod Touch and fits perfect in my travel purse . Likes -Portablity , comes with a small black drawstring bag . -Size , fits in my smallest purse , easy to tavel with . -Battery standby life on this battery is awesome . -Charges my iPhone and Galaxy Player faster than the computer and car charger . -Charges my dead iPhone 2x 's while using the phone , probably more if I did n't use ( surfing , talking , etc ) it while charging . Dislikes -Power button easily depressed when in my purse , so I found a cushioned case to keep that from happening . -Adapters , charges with a micro usb cable , it ships with that and cables but there not dedicated , there 's an adapter included for that . But accessories are easily found at Walmart or online . This is a great addition to tech family .
5 #### I bought this cable to connect&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Flip - MinoHD - Camcorder-2nd - Generation-2 - Hours - Brushed - Metal / dp / B002R5AM7C / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Flip MinoHD Camcorder 2nd Generation , 2 Hours ( Brushed Metal)</a>&nbsp;to my LCD TV . It works great . The cable I received from SF Planet was slightly different from the picture . The pictured cable has rounded plastic connectors , but the one I received has square ones . I really do not care much about this , but if someone does , be aware .
4 #### I am very satisfied with both the price and quality of product . I surely will recommend this product to others . KK
5 #### I recently had one of my vehicles painted , and although they did a good job , I noticed some light scratches in the paint when parked in sunlight . Not wanting to wait the usual month or two for the paint to cure in order to wax and polish them out , I picked up 3 M 39007 Imperial Hand Glaze . Since it allows fresh paint to breath by not leaving any wax or silicone behind , it was perfect for the job . It made the new paint shine , and eliminated most of the imperfections that were annoying me . When using it , you need to do small areas at a time , and remove it before it dries completely . Otherwise it 's hard to get off . I 'm very happy I gave this a try . Now I can wait until it 's safe to wax .
1 #### This tool will not fit the 2004 Ford Expedition Power Steering pump as advertised .
1 #### This product was way too overpriced for what it was worth . This is the worst of all the blackberrys to have ever come out and the phone breaks easily .
4 #### Received the purchase as described and on schedule . Charged up the head set , turned it on and every bluetooth device in the house tried to connect . Paired it to a Samsung Focus and it worked just fine . The unit is not real pretty but the ear spearker has good volumn , the mike picks up well and for hands free in the car I wanted to hear and be heard over the traffic and road noise .
4 #### These headphones sound really good for the money . Wish they had a volumn control on the cable . But overall , they are a pleasure to listen to .
5 #### These are my go to sticks for all concert percussion - hefty and nice , great balance , standard , all around stick . I 've had a pair for 7 years , and I still use them regularly .
5 #### I love this product , and here is why . I have had it for a good year or two now , and it is still going strong . I am a college student and definitely am on my electronic devices a lot , and carrying this around in my backpack has saved me many times . I can charge my phone and friends ' phones from my backpack in the middle of class . I get about 2.5 charges on my iPhone 5 from the charger . I plug it in to charge when I go to sleep and it is fully charged by the time I wake up , using just a 1 Amp charger brick .
5 #### very high quality and the right products , fast service and great service !
2 #### Skip the hype . It 's incompatible with current Windows platforms ( 7 , 8 , 10 ) . If you 're using XP and Vista ( maybe ) , yes the drive will work . Lenovo now owns Iomega and does n't offer usable support . Do n't listen to the download this and that chat . Do n't waste your time or money . If it were n't for BooksAMillion 's courteous , understanding customer service , which gladly gave me a refund , I 'd give it zero stars . I was so disappointed it did n't function as indicated . Reviews that claim it functions were written more than 5 - 15 years ago .
2 #### Bought this for my boyfriend ... The case fit his phone well but the clip started to pull away from case in 2 weeks
5 #### Bought this for my brother on for his birthday he loves it .
5 #### I use these headphones with an MP3 player on daily walks . They are comfortable , stay in place because of a snug fit , and sound good on all types of material , especially audio books . And , of course , you can hardly beat the low price ; so I can unhesitatingly recommend them . A fine buy !
4 #### The " sticks " are coated with a nice smooth silicone finish , makes keeping a grip on them easy . Initially , the wire brushes are a little resistant to deploying and retracting , but maybe this will loosen up over time . The mechanism is merely a rubber stopper at the end that creates friction with the metal shaft . I do n't know if you use these for a long time if they 'll stay in place when only partially deployed . I think it 'll be okay long - term for full deployment since there is a notch at the end of the metal shaft . The sound is nice . Makes for great practicing while indoors .
4 #### hola todo fino gustaooo muchoooooo everything right all excellent recommend y poreque esta muy buernono em ha llegadotodo bien lo recomiendo
5 #### I do n't use the factory iphone headphones with the built in microphone , so I ca n't comment on whether or not that aspect works . I recently got a new iphone case that would n't allow my aux input for my car to fit through it , so I got this adapter . Sound plays through my speakers loud and clear , so I could n't be happier .
5 #### I put these in a Sawtooth tele . I do n't regret it .
3 #### I paid less than $ 5 including shipping for this so with that in mind it 's good value . However it is smaller than the picture would suggest . A coke can would n't fit in the top .
5 #### Originally I purchased a Behringer EQ700 equalizer pedal for my rig . It was cheap at around $ 20 + some change but like the other reviewers noted , it 's noisy with hiss . So I took the advice of another reviewer & bought the Fish & Chips model by Danaelectro and it 's terrific . I plugged it directly in line on my SKB pedal board , turned them both on , turned on the amp , put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max & no discernible hiss nor hum . Mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable . This pedal has a cool 1950 's style & appearance . It has a great punch when you raise up the Level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar & amp sounds . For a modifying pedal , you can not go wrong for the $ 30 price tag . If you 're in the market for a great 7 band EQ pedal , then you 'll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one . This product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars .
4 #### The cigarette lighter is located at the base of my dash which is a perfect location for this mount . Some careful twisting of the arm was required to get it just right and out of the way of the stick shift . Do not attempt to adjust the arm by holding on to the holder or it will break ! I bought two this time , to replace the first one which was stolen . We liked the first one so much , that when I was going to order a replacement my husband wanted one too . It is very well thought out , having a power - pass - through and fully adjustable holder . It works with my husband 's Blackberry and my HTC Touch Pro in its case . I have my phone plugged into the FM transmitter and power all together . Occasionally I have to push the mount back into the cigarette lighter because it has worked its way out , but overall it holds up well with the road motion and shaking .
5 #### Great bumper case and great price . Buy it . Best dollar seventy eight I 've ever spent in my entire life in the history of the world .
5 #### These things are quality products , heavy ! did the job , recommend , a tad on the pricy side , but again , good quality .
4 #### The real value of this binocular is because it is so compact . It could fit into your pant pocket and still give you a useful tool . It has 12x magnification and the image is quite good compared to other binoculars in the same price range . It also has a rugged look and feel with a nice rubber casing . The only problems that I find with the binocular is that 12x is a bit too unsteady to hold with your hands . So I find myself leaning on a nearby support in an attempt to keep the view from shaking . Also due to the small objective lens of the binocular , the view at night is not as bright as it could be ( on comparing with a binocular with a 50 mm objective lens ) . These are not really problems of this binocular but are limitations due to its size and magnification . In short these are quite impressive .
5 #### Given as a gift to someone who had reception problems at home . I set it up and no more needed to be done , it has worked for them very well . Limited coverage in the house is the only issue , but they can make calls from the house now , which was impossible before .
2 #### Ordered the large and it still barely fit my pinky .
5 #### This is a great , easy to apply wax . It goes on easy and comes off just as fast . Actually , you are not removing the wax but merely drying it with a second cloth . Leaves the car 's finish smooth and shiny . Love this product !
5 #### was not aware that i bought two cords , but hey you can never go wrong with a longer cord for yout ipod / iphone i love this item because it allows me to be away from the wall / outlet while charging and using my phone at the same time , wish is came in other colors , but over all it serves its purpose
1 #### I installed the antenna as per instructions and it did NOTHING . Zilch .... Nada Find something else if you 're serious about getting an extra bar . This device is a total waste
5 #### What more is there to say other than it does the job on my 1.25 inch receiver ? No rattle or wobble .
4 #### i kinda love this case but i really wish that it was puffed up from the front so if the phone falls on it 's front it would have some room from the surface . it 's not big . it 's good looking .
3 #### I 've had this for over a year on my Les Paul Custom . Installs without drilling holes . I wo n't review tracking because all this is only a 6 pole pickup . What I can speak to is the durability . The wire that goes between the hex pickup and the control unit on the guitar became loose and interrupted my rehearsal -- luckily not at a gig . It should be an easy fix at a service center , but this is a mission - critical item for a guitar synth user and there is no excuse for such a blatant design flaw from such a well - regarded company as Roland . But they also have very little competition in the hex pickup arena , so they may let us suffer . If it was n't for that annoying flaw , the GR-55 is just absolutely fantastic .
5 #### These are great for all around playing . I 've never received a bad stick from Amazon . These are reasonably priced and so much more convenient than going to Guitar Center and having to deal with the idiot in the drum room . I have a wide variety of Vic sticks that I bought here on Amazon . Another favorite is the 2BN , it 's a log with a nylon tip , great for heavy metal thrashing , very articulate . Good music to all
4 #### Cheap , no frills unadorned strap , just what I was looking for for a giveaway guitar . Probably would n't use for my main axe or a heavy one , just not comfortable enough .
5 #### It 's what I expected and works for my needs , it was packaged well and would recommend to any needing the same product .
5 #### This worked for me while I had the phone . It is past tense now as a phone ( and possibly a company ) .
5 #### This works really well for me . I use this when I 'm recording my ISA One into my Profire 2626 . I use this with my XLR cable to bypass the internal preamp on my Profire 2626 . Works perfect .
5 #### These are by far the best $ 7 headphones I 've ever bought . For such small headphones , the bass on these is ridiculously good . I use these headphones to listen to music on my LG G4 phone and music sounds great on them . They do n't hurt my ears either after a couple of hours of wearing . The headband is also comfortable . I bought 3 , one for me , and two for my sons . After having listened to them , I 'll buy another pair for my office .
3 #### I like this case for my iphone . It is quite handy . It will please you .
5 #### I have been using this card for several years . I frequently travel internationally and need short - term access to international roaming , which my old cell provider did not offer and my new one charges a monthly fee for . I put this in my phone when I am out of the country and it has been very useful . When I expect high use or an extended stay I buy a separate sim card from a local provider in the country , but for occasional use I use this . The per - minute usage charges are very high , but if you consider the cost of a sim card for each country , this plan is still a good idea for low use . I have also used it for backup when my pre - paid sim card unexpectedly ran out of funds on my last trip ( $ % ^ kids ! ) . I have had good reception ; it has worked wherever there was any cell reception . Make sure your phone has a sim card , is unlocked , and that the frequency will work where you are headed . I always buy unlocked quad - band phones and have had no trouble in Europe , Asia , Africa , S America & N America .
5 #### The YX510 dual band repeater works well . I bought it mainly for a Verizon broadband USB modem that was only getting at best 2 bars and sometimes none . As soon as I hooked up the zboost ( with the signal antenna at the roof peak ) , I went to 5 bars . I was getting RSSI of -100 and up and that went to -65 so I am getting a good signal to the USB modem now . I went from download / upload speeds of 100/75 to 650/250 . I have the zboost sitting right beside the laptop so I can not speak for range . I have n't tried it with my cell phone but its bars went up , too . It is a tad pricey , but it makes broadband possible for me whereas my only other choice would have been Hughes Net satellite which is n't getting such great reviews from users and is not portable at all .
5 #### I purchased this battery for mobile use . I have been using it to keep my iPhone charged while riding my road bike with Google maps , a bike riding program and Pandora running . I has been perfect for the use .
3 #### The one piece of plastic was really good and lined up with the holes . But , the insert pegs with screws sucked ! Pushed them into the hole and went to screw it in and screw went all the way in . Go to let off on it and it just fell out into my engine area ! So now I had one less . Well , I went MacGyver on it ! Down to the hardware store . Found drywall anchors that fur out when a screw goes in . Bought stainless steel screws and washer . Drove those baby home and now solid ! Looks great now and will stay on until I want it off .
5 #### Really nice guitar stand . Folds up nicely and seems very sturdy . I wanted a guitar stand that would hold my guitar securely while out playing and this has an automatic locking feature when you put your guitar in it .
5 #### these vent shades are a great investiment for the price was easy to install and they look great and i love them
5 #### It is one of the few quality VHS Head Cleaner items still available on the market . Some of the newer VHS Player devices " reject " this tape when you press " Play " because it knows that it is not a real VHS cassette tape . So then you have to press play multiple times to get it to run across the heads long enough . Otherwise this item seems to be effective to adequately clean the tape heads in your VCR . Enjoy !
1 #### Lasts 3 - 6 weeks so you better buy a lot of it .
5 #### I play all the time . I change my strings about every 3 months or so . These do n't tarnish like others due to heavy playing .
3 #### I gave this mount 3 stars . 5 to start because out of the box , and mounted on the wall , I really liked it for my daughter 's room . The ability to move her 26 " TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition . I subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum , about 2 feet away from the wall . 1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted , the mount seems to sag , even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it . That parts not the problem , the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself , it seems no matter how many washers you use , it just does not make full contact . Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to " fall " in that direction on its hinges . SO it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves . Otherwise , it works I guess . But for $ 50 I 'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about . I would not set a tv larger than a 30 " or so on this . I just do n't trust it .
5 #### Took about 15 minutes to clean and measure . Make sure to not peel the back of the tape all the way when you first lay it down .
4 #### This case fits the Blackberyy Storm to a " T " It has the openings for access to the buttons in all of the right places provides good shock protection . Just a warning though , it is very difficult to take off after you have snapped it on .
1 #### squeaked horribly until I added a few drops of oil UPDATE : today it fell apart . This is garbage .. I threw it away , and will buy a better one . Very disappointed .
5 #### If you have a crappy tripod like me , you 'll love this remote . its reugged , small , canon , etc . If you have a good tripod the you 're a more wealthy amateur than me or you 're not an amateur at all but a pro so you know you wanna buy it . :)
5 #### Used in years past . Picked up the guitar again and looked in several music stores for this but could n't find . Easy to use , not messy , works well and carries easy in case . Glad I found it on Amazon .
5 #### Nice brass slide . I wish it was slightly shorter and slightly thicker , but still a great value for the money ! It is approximately a size 9 ring size .
5 #### This is the mouthpiece I chose in the music store when I knew almost nothing and purchased my first student clarinet . Six months later I started private lessons and my professor used the identical mouthpiece on his beautiful clarinet . He retired and sold me that clarinet and I kept his mouthpiece as a spare . You MUST use # 3 reeds with it - nothing softer - to get the beautiful tone . I use Vandoren V-12 reeds , but everyone has their favorite .
4 #### This unit works ! I had 2 Motorola bluetooth headsets and I was about to give up on bluetooth headses altogether . This one sounds good in the car for both the listener to whom I am talking to and for myself . In fact it actually sounds better than pressing the phone up to my ear . It can be loud as well which is good and bad . The good is when you have a lot of background noise , this thing can be heard . The bad , is it can be really loud ! It is a little difficult to use , but once it is on it is very comfortable . However you have to take it on and off to use the ridiculously small on / off button . Not good for anyone with large hands . The battery could last a little longer too . In summary I have tried other headsets besides the Motorola ones and this one sounds the best . Especially in a car where it makes the most difference since my car has a manual transmission . I also use it in the office with my computer . It works . That is all I care about at this point .
4 #### First set of strap locks I 've tried and am very pleased with them . The only change I would suggest is to have a larger diameter base . They pulled out af a vintage strap ( no damage , I caught the bass ) I had due to the softness of the leather and the length of the slit .
1 #### This product does not work with my base unit at all , even though they are both the same brand . Sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit . However , is RCA quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely do n't work ? Very inconvenient for customers . It also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w/ base units and extensions from the Amazon reviews I 've read . Do your homework and I would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand .
5 #### It a great case , fits perfectly and was exactly the same as the one in the verizon store for 4 times the price .
5 #### This is the best belt clip I 've seen for the Garmin Oregon series . Easy to remove and reattach the Garmin . This is especially handy if yours includes the camera .
4 #### This product does work on my 1996 dodge Dakota , BUT , you will need a cutting tool to safely remove all the un - used tabs and mounting supports . I took me a while to remove all the un - needed parts . Otherwise , it 's good sturdy plastic . Satisfied
5 #### Great for help baby proof a room for wires . This should be added to the babies section .
5 #### I have not been playing the guitar for very long ( one of the items that has been on my list of things to do and now I am finally doing it ) so I do not have a solid base of experience to draw on . However I replaced the strings with the Elixer strings last month and I liked the tone immediately , not quite as sharp as the strings that came with guitar . I have been playing them for a month now and I am very pleased with the tone and the playability .
5 #### This microphone is one of those go anywhere do anything mics . It sounds good on lots of sound sources and also does an excellent job . I have used this mic for my sax recordings on albums , flutes , clarinets , guitar amps , pianos , and much more . It has a very even clean sound that is very easy to work with . It is not particularly colored or weighted mic , but it does have a slightly brighter sound than the at4047 , which is also an excellent mic . So this mic tends to respond better to sound sources where clarity and bright sounds are preffered . ( Strings , Piano , Room Micing , Cymbals ) All in all this is a great all around studio mic that works great in a wide variety of applications . And the price is very good to boot .
4 #### Maxell 8 mm tapes are hard to find for me in my area these days . Glad I was able to make my purchase and got them within three days which was perfect for what I needed them for . Overall very happy with the results .
5 #### Good K&N Product . It is exactly what you can find in a parts store , but at a more reasonable price .
5 #### Used it in a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo , loved the sound . Not loud , but flows better than stock
5 #### I lost my charger that came w/ my android phone so I hopped on amazon and found this sweet deal . Seriously I saved a good $ 10-$15 compared to what Sprint would have tried to charge me or bestbuy or WHATEVER ! Bottom line is this works great and I did n't pay very much for it ^_^
5 #### I 've been playing Blue Steels since the 90 's - I switched for a while , tried numerous other strings on various basses , but no matter the bass , no matter the style I 'm playing , I keep coming back to these . They 're not as annoyingly bright as some strings are at first - but after a few weeks they settle into their sweet spot & hold it for a solid month of hard playing - at times I 've kept them on for 6 mos plus , but prefer to change them about every one to two months . Love their sound . Not too bright , not too flat , crsip , & a great feel on the fingers .
5 #### Exactly what I needed to allow me to plug my computers , tablet and smartphone into my stereo receiver via any function with RCA input and route my music , sound for online or downloaded movies , etc . through my Cambridge Soundworks surround sound system .
4 #### I do like Monster Power products but you certainly pay a premium to get them . That 's okay - it 's slim , has plenty of plugs , and works . After a lightening strike that blew out some other electrical items , this item was still running strong , so that 's good . I do n't know if it mattered ( the fuse box took most of the hit ) but still , I 'm glad my TV etc . did n't blow up .
5 #### They do exactly what you want them to and show no signs of breaking after weekly moves and daily use for almost a year .
4 #### The lights I use these in make it a pain to swap them out , but that 's not the fault of these gel caps . They work as expected . I like the color .
5 #### Loving it . Clearly sound on calls , long live battery and comfort ear hock . I trust all of Motorola Bluetooth Headset .
1 #### This is listed as being compatible with a sidewinder pro 2 .... IT IS NOT ! product info is not correct . I bought this for an older Sidewinder Pro 2 I had . This adapter does not work with it , even with drivers installed . A big waste of time . Meanwhile a logitec adapter my brother had fired right up . Do n't waste your money or time .
3 #### Class 6 cards worked well in my Samsung tablets than the Class 10s of this capacity . Do n't understand why but that is what works
5 #### Tried to migrate my wife 's old Macbook Pro to a new one . Over the network - consistently failed at " 1 min remaining " . Googled for it - many people having the same issue , no solution . Tried with Time Machine backup - would consistently crash . Called it a day . Got the Firewire cable . Left the machines doing the migration overnite . No errors . So - great for Belkin and Firewire . Sucks for Apple , Time Machine and the Migration Wizard over the network .
5 #### Excellent Bluetooth headset ! I recommend Jawbone 's products this is my second one in the last 4 years !
5 #### I use them with my laptop as I live with a day sleeper and watch shows at night so I do n't disturb my partners sleep . The sound is great and I can still hear what is going on around me . Good price , seems they are good quality and a long cord so I do n't have to sit right next to the lap top . I highly recommend these .
5 #### The GE Superadio III is impossible to beat . Long battery life ( 6 D cells ) , superb AM sound that can be made even better on strong signals by switching it to " wide " bandwidth mode , and sensitivity that allows me to listen to NY and NJ AM stations during the day at my home in MD , using just the Superadio 's built - in antenna . The only way it could be better would be to have a digital frequency display , but the analog " dial " is OK enough once you get used to it . The FM section is no slouch , either . Mine picks up a distant high - school station without even extending the antenna . And , the Superadio is also one of only two radios I 've ever been able to use at home ( near a busy tower ) with no front end overload problems at all . ( The other radio is a discontinued model that cost 2.5 times as much -- in 1970 dollars -- as the Superadio does now . )
5 #### Need to replace all or part of a CD Jewel Case ? Some replacement brands are flimsy . These Maxell cases are well made and reassemble easily . They are available here at Amazon for a very fair price . Recommended .
5 #### I was looking for a convenient way to charge my iphone , and this item fit the bill perfectly . It is heavy enough to sit upright on your desk without toppling over , and the quality of everything feels quite good . The phone plugs in easily thanks to a small channel that aligns the phone ( no fumbling around to get the plugs aligned ) . The portable takeaway battery has proven useful , especially when I travel overseas and the phone sits unused for several days . Overall , a useful product at a very good price .
4 #### Chilton 's is a good reference but I think it 's suffering due to availability of so much information off the internet . Great for finding part numbers , but when it comes to installation & removal using internet videos can be better .
5 #### I 'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working ... for the EXACT same phone ! I just do n't get it . I decided to try it out despite the people that said it did n't work , and I 'm glad I did . It 's exactly what I expected and wanted . I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work . For only $ 4 and some change for the both ... this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery !
5 #### covered up worn steering wheel and does n't look tacky . Does n't slide around either . all in all very satisfied , not one complaint
5 #### It 's great ! I seem to be running a bit behind with these . My bad .
5 #### I had several copper propane gas lines to flare . This tool makes it incredibly easy . Every fitting was gas - tight the first time . Definitely the correct tool for the job .
5 #### They are comfortable , they pick up voice easily and well , the sound is great , and the design is so comfortable that you have to feel with your fingers to find out if they are on .
5 #### My old stock radio was on the firtz , and the replacement I picked up was a single DIN stereo . The Metra installation kit easily allows you to resize the original double DIN slot , giving you a spot to install your stereo , and a nice cubby for personal storage . I figured I could store my phone here while I commute . The face plate is made from ABS plastic and due to how it sits over the car stereo , and it 's painted it to match your interior without much chance of the radio scratching it up . When I first started installing it , I had some problems . Turns out I did n't remove the extra bezel on the stereo , so I originally could n't get the top half to sit properly . After I removed the bezel , the face - plate snapped right on , and is holding the receiver tightly in place . There are no screws , nuts or bolts . It came with an radio mounting bracket , but I did n't end using it . Instructions were also included for those who need them . As you long as you remember it goes over the installed radio , it 's fairly easy to see how the two snaps fit into place . I usually replace a double DIN stereo with a double DIN stereo . I was n't sure on how it was going to look in comparison to the original stereo , but now that I 'm done , I 'm very happy with the look and feel of the face - plate .
5 #### This works perfectly for me as a way to use headphones and control the volume from the line out port on my monitor .
5 #### Work great for 814 Taylor as recommended . Personal preference would be for full medium set but Taylor specifies these . Long lasting and bright .
5 #### These strings are a lot less bright and twangy than most and perfect if you are going for a classic old school tone and are not ready for flats . I have an overly bright 70 's jazz bass and these really helped in taming the high end sizzle and clack . Also at this price it wo n't cost you much to try them out or keep a fresh set on hand .
4 #### For the price , you can not get better headphones . Earbuds hurt my ears , so I wanted a " headband " style pair that sat on the outside of my ears . I chose the Panasonic RP - HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port because of the price ( < $ 5 ) and because there were so many great reviews . Normally , I shy away from super cheap deals because you usually get what you pay for ( i.e. , cheap deal = cheap product ) . Not so with these headphones . They are lightweight with a very decent sound , and are extremely comfortable . I had no problems wearing these on a 4 hour flight . My ears never hurt once , and I hardly noticed the headband . Plus , if I do every lose or break them , I wo n't be upset because of the price . But they seem very durable , and survived a round trip flight and being shoved in my backpack . They 've already been used well more than $ 5 worth , so I feel like it 's money well spent . If you need a great set of headphones at a reasonable price , then definitely get these .
5 #### Best price around . Delivered to door . What 's better than that .
4 #### I bought a Roku 3 because I could use headphones with it if I wanted to stay up late to watch a movie . These are more than adequate for the price and work perfectly . I am happy with my purchase .
5 #### Very simple object , so there 's not much to say , other than to note that it is very sturdy and seems likely to last quite a long time . After buying one and using it a couple weeks or so , I came back and bought a second one , which goes to show my trust in this file / folder holder 's quality and durability . It 's also quite practical because it can hold a bunch of folders without taking up ANY additional space , such as due to an outside frame , which the horizontal stacking trays do , thereby taking up more of your valuable desktop space , or wherever you 'd put such a thing ( these things are useful on bookshelves or on top of file cabinets , etc . ) . Even without any external frame , the folders I put in this object never slide out on their own , or have any other problem . There 's nothing bad I can think of to say about this thing ( and I 'm usually capable of coming up with at least one thing I would have wished was different about any object I buy , averaging a few such things even with items I like ! ) .
3 #### It was a cheap screen cover so I bought it and it does exactly what a cheap screen cover will do . The screen protector scratches easily and provide a strange sort of friction when being used . But I 'm just using it for now while I wait for my new skinomi skin to come in .
5 #### Exactly what I needed for my Casio Label Maker . Hard to find at a reasonable price .
4 #### I would suggest getting one with a weight activated holder- that is , the holder is open and spring loaded . When you put headstock on the holder it automatically closes- much more handy . These are about same price and match what most stores use to either hang or place their guitars .
2 #### I can not recognoze well how 7 - foot long because I 'm Japanese and the peoples other than US use metric unit . It does n't wrok for my intension because too short !
2 #### this should n't have so many plastic parts . take you time when using this kit .
5 #### I took delivery of this router this afternoon - great servicefrom Amazon . Setup was pretty easy except that I had Enternet PPPoE and Nortel Networks Extranet Access client installed as network adapters and I had some serious juggling to do to get the stuff to work . Once I removed the PPPoE software and set the DNS servers on my network card I was all set . I have set static IP addresses because of some software that I run as services on my NT box . The Nortel software is so that I can run a VPN connection to my office and it works like a dream , through the router . In about two weeks I am taking delivery of an Apple G4 Cube which will also be connected to this router .... Great product . Great value for money .
5 #### The Dynamat is a bit challenging to fit into bare panels of a car . But once you have made a template from newspaper , the material is easy to cut . Use a roller to roll it and attach solidly to the panel . IT REALLY WORKS ! Well worth the time it takes to help reduce buzzing and vibrating .
5 #### This product performs as described . I have no complaints . I bought it to use multiple computers from my internet connection using wired connections . So far it 's worked flawlessly .
4 #### Used these for speaker wire in a surround sound setup . Caution - Tape sticks to the wall really well and will pull off the paint if you have to reposition one . Like them because they are one piece and big enough to hold speaker wire and an electrical cord but not big enough to be obtrusive on a wall .
3 #### The good : Lights up both pages of a book . The clip is good enough though a bit bulky . I guess that 's the price of running on standard batteries . The bad : Way too bright , even on the low setting . The color temperature is also pretty terrible ; too blue for night time .
5 #### This is a great product at a fair price . I hope it is useful to note : this is my third purchase of this particular product and I plan to order from this company in the future . The most important feature of a screen protector is PRIVACY : when I am working , texting or just idling in public places , I want my all of my information protected . This product accomplishes the task beautifully ! The screens are easy to install and fit perfectly on my iPhone 3G. I find the mirror finish stylish and useful ; I can even check my lipstick ... ha ha ! The only negative is the screen gets smeared and dirty very easily ; however , the product does include a lint cloth . The glue on the back of the screen protector adheres to the iPhone very well and the bubbles that appear upon install can be completely smoothed and eradicated . The screen protectors are durable and one can last for several months . I like to change screens every month or so and at this price , I can do it ! Good job , Empire ; thank you !
5 #### Purchased this for my old VW engine ... works great . Had to shop a lot before this purchase because these things are very expensive . This was the lowest price I could fid .
5 #### They do the job , would recommend . Such advice is best to purchase packs of 5 , are cheaper than when you buy one , and if you have anything else you need to change , you will have replacement
5 #### A million words of praise have already been sung about these strings , but the fact that my fingers squeak on the strings so much less is why I love them so much . Well worth the slight extra cost .
5 #### Firm grip on inside of truck bed should help prevent contents from sliding around , without distorting the bed itself .
5 #### We needed to hook two computers up to an ethernet switch box . This short cable was just the right size for the computer which sat next to the switch box . Very sturdy cable , and the clips on the ends look like they 'll last a long time .
5 #### these are possible some of the best knock around headphones i have had ! if there is a contender for the Port - a - Pros it 's the Sport -a - Pros ! ! ! ! ! ! these headphones are GREAT and very versatile ! ! ! !
5 #### Compact , stylish , and very comfortable . Currently one of the only headsets known to work well with the HTC Mogul . I wear it all day and never run out of my charge , and sometimes even forget that I am wearing it because it is so lighweight and comfortable . Amazon has top pricing on this product too . I could buy two here for what I 'd pay full retail elsewhere . Sound is clear on both my end and the receiver 's end . Great product and great value .
4 #### yes , they are the best headphones in their price range . you will not be dissapointed , especially since you can get them for under $ 100 every now and then ! my only complaint is that the wire is built in . it would be nice if they had a 3.5 mm jack so you could use any cable you prefer . i use these with my computer and the long bungy cord is a bit annoying . plus i have taken them on the road a few times , it would be nice to switch out the cable for a more modest 3 - 4 ft when traveling . i added a modmic 4.0 to these are they work great for gaming . i did recently switch to Philip fidelio x1 headphones , but i would nt say they are necessarily drastically better . they seem better on the low end , but they also do n't go as loud from a computer / phone without an external amp . where are the sonys go louder then i need from my computers headphone jack .
4 #### I am using this kit to pressurize two airbags in my rear coil springs . I pull a 7500 lb . trailer with my Durango and the springs are a little weak after 8 years . So rather than replace the springs , I thought that I would give myself some adjustability while getting back my original spring support . All the fitting are the quick connect type and do not leak . The compressor works well and is not too noisy . The control console has an outdated look to it but does the job . The supplied gauge is inaccurate by more than 5 psi . I used several tire gauges connected to the optional manual fill port ( Shrader valve)to get an accurate reading then marked the gauge face with the correct numbers . I would have replaced the gauge but not many will fit in the arrangement behind the panel . It was worth the investment and time . I used to get flashed by oncoming traffic for bright headlights whenever the trailer was connected . Now I just push the button to correct the rear height and all is well . During the day I adjust the pressure for the best ride .
4 #### The sound is very good , but they tend to lose one channel after a while . Very cheap so you get what you pay for , but for the same reason I keep replacements on hand . I use mainly for audiobooks .
5 #### I 've bought two of these so far and they work great . Quality is superb with a steel housing and 15 ' long power cord ! As far as some of the negative review , do n't expect this $ 30 strip to replace your $ 200 rack mounted , AVR power conditioner . There is no true power conditioning ( AVR -- automatic voltage regulation ) going on here with the Furman SS-6B , it is simply a power strip with EMI / RFI filtering . Pros 1 . Build quality ( cord , metal housing ) 2 . EMI / RFI filtering ( removed random static / pops we had been getting ( vacuum cleaner , microwave , fans , etc ) 3 . Illuminated power switch 4 . Built - in 15amp circuit breaker 5 . Price Con 1 . Not a true AVR " power conditioner " ( it does n't boost / limit AC power , just filters out EMI / RFI )
3 #### this product is great for quickly cleaning your cds but be warned that it is flimsy and the solution runs out kinds quickly .
5 #### This is the best spot cleaner for carpet I have every used . Does n't matter if the stain is fresh or very old ; this gets the stain out every time .
3 #### This lens is cheap and very light . Admittedly I was n't very impressed at first , but with addition of a sigma UV filter my pictures at 200 mm are now clearer and a truer reflection of the subject . At 200 the pictures tend to be a bit soft , but it 's noticeable unless you do some serious cropping . With this lens I also prefer to shoot with auto zoom instead of manual zoom .
4 #### Great strings . Sound great and the poly coating makes it easy on the fingers and protects from wear and tear from sweat and skin oils . I love these strings , great tone and they stay in tune . Highly recommended for all guitar players out there .
5 #### high quality and having dealt with their customer service dept in the past I can tell you that they are a reputable and customer service driven company . just buy this one and stop buying cheap garbage you throw away every 6 - 12 months . This one will last you at least 18 months .
4 #### This product does what the marketeers have said . I am willing to order more of this product if still on the market .
5 #### Beautiful set of strings . The tone is clear and they have lasted much longer than my previous set of Martin strings .
3 #### It works and does what it says . Seems to work quite well , even though my sump pump tends to be a slight overload for it . There was an unexpected surprise after I set this up with my sump pump and tested it . On utility power , my sump pump draws 9.1 amps ( right about 1100 watts ) but when running off only the inverter , the amp draw went to 11.3amps ( right about 1350 watts ) . The draw went up by 2.2 amps because the sump pump becomes less efficient when running off of a modified sine wave ( inverter ) , vs a true sine wave ( power company ) power source . This increase in power consumption was a surprise , but thankfully the inverter seems to handle it without an issue .
2 #### Feels like cheaper plastic , and I feel hard to insert iPhone 5 . Had to use both hands every time . Expected much better quality . Wo n't recommend .
5 #### Of all the things you can do to change the sound of your guitar , a new pick is the easiest and often most effective . This pick has a nice sound , one I prefer to my nylon picks . One caveat for first time users is that Ultex is a stiffer material than Nylon , so this pick is comparable to nylon picks in the .88 range in terms of flexibility while playing .
5 #### This thing is genius . I have two trailers with a 2 " ball , and one older boat trailer with a 1 7/8 " ball ( why ? ) . This is an elegant solution to the problem . There 's no way to lock the balls on the post , so I keep the balls in my truck so they do n't get stolen . When I need to tow , I 'll just dig out the right size ball and toss it on , it only takes a second . I can do it without a screwdriver , it 's not that tricky . I 've had this on my truck for about a year and have n't had any problems taking the balls on or off , even after getting the hitch muddy . I 'm not towing anything heavy , my heaviest trailer is maybe 1000lbs , but it tows just like any other ball .
5 #### I would like to say it changed my life .... but its a printer cable , . qualtity looks fine ,
5 #### Worked great to restore the shine and luster of my 20 year old fiberglass shower stall , including the floor pan . Used with a DA polisher and proper grade pads for each step , although I recommend a quality set of pads vs the bargain stuff .
3 #### Install was pretty straight forward and the ease of being able to to inflate / deflate the bags from the cab is fantastic . Only problem is there is a small leak somewhere that I can not find ( tried soapy water on every connection , T , and joint from the control center to the compressor to the air bags and no leak found ... so that is annoying having to fill the bags each morning , but this controller makes that easier . The air lines are , in my honest opinion , too stiff of plastic and makes running lines a little difficult in tighter spaces . But all in all it is a nice system that works well .
4 #### This has been a great wallet/ case for me . It provided a comfy & secure fit for my Treo 650 then for my iPhone 3Gs . The craftmanship & materials are surprisingly good for the price . Neither the magnetic closure nor the belt clip has let my phone fall or escape its grip . The wallet is " tightly " crafted . Initially all the card slots seem too small , but the quality leather will endure some stretching for a custom fit . I definately prefer a snug fit instead of unzipping and having cards fly everywhere . Pros : Will securely hold a variety of phones , quality craftmanship & materials for the price . Cons : Card slots initially very tight . ( a little elbow grease & patience is needed ) Note : Double - stack cards to stretch the leather if you prefer a more loose fit .
4 #### I have two of these that hold different types of keyboards . They are solid and nicely adjustable . As a stand for use standing up and playing a keyboard ( which I never do ) , they are first class . For seated work my only quibble is you have to watch for knee clearance when placing the keyboard - you want it as far towards you as the stand will allow without overbalancing otherwise your knees are likely to hit the X the supports make .
5 #### Worked pretty well . I can feel when the haze is polished off because my cloth has less drag . This is not an " instant " cleaner , takes some elbow grease .
5 #### I prefer woven cables for looks . They have a nice stage presence . Hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables . I do n't move around on stage so the 18 feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer . This cable is just a little stiffer than some I have but that 's OK for me and I 'm sure it will wear well if you move around on stage .
5 #### I love getting this item on the Subscription setup . Always just in time for guitar upkeep .
5 #### First time using them - awesome strings ! ! ! ! They were suggested by my guitar teacher and I love them !
5 #### These work as expected and are cheaper than buying at the local store . Suggest having plenty around before starting any project and strongly suggest investing in the correct crimping tool before starting any mproject more than a patch cable to save a lot of headaches . Cat5 cable and RJ45 connectors are really easy with the right equipment and a pain in the rear without it .
5 #### I purchased this for my 2001 BMW 740i and have had it in use for several months . It 's suction is incredibly powerful and the neck , while a bit difficult to adjust , is very firm and does not shake / wiggle etc . Most people will likely mount this to the windshield , however I am using on my shifter console and it puts it right where I want / need it for accessing my iPhone .
1 #### wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless , the screen came out , was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better ... avoid this ! !
5 #### This will be the last set of headphones you buy , all others will fail to compare . They are comfortable for long periods of time , sound is smooth with a slightly dark mood . I also find them to be excellent for amateur radio .
5 #### A beautiful sounding cymbal at a knockout price . Crisp highs with controlled overtones make this a perfect accent to any percussion set - up .
5 #### It worked pretty fantastically and regularly when I used my Zune .
5 #### I purchased these head phones for my grandson to used with his new Elec . Piano and he really likes them . The sound is clear and chrisp . We were very happy with the service we recieved for this order .
3 #### Good sound but kind of a headach keeping the ear plugs in my ear .
5 #### This is a fantastic Synthetic Towel . I have a black car and this one towel is all I need to dry it with . Sure I have to wring it out several times , but it is well worth the extra effort . Once I am done , my car 's finish is streak - free and the glass needs little if any wiping with a microfiber cloth . I do suggest wringing as much water as you can and then storing it in the tube it came in . This helps keep it moist and mildew free .
5 #### After reading a few negative reviews I was a bit skeptical , but decided to try this out for myself , because no matter how many people love an item , there 's always some who will hate it . I was EXTREMELY PLEASED with this item , because this is very helpful for replying to e - mails on my iPod Touch . My fingers are large and a bit clumsy , and I used to get pretty irritated hitting the wrong keys all the time when typing . Dragging items takes a slight bit getting used to , because the key is TO NOT apply pressure , but lightly touch icons , screens , etc . However , I still use my fingers most the time because of the obvious convenience , but for any kind of typing , this is a fantastic item , and I would strongly recommend this to anyone with an iPod Touch or an iPhone . There were two in the package , plus a screen protector , and with no tax , and no shipping , this was a fantastic deal for me .
4 #### I use my Epiphone SG electric guitar on this stand . The only drawback is ...... I ca n't let it sit in the little rests all of the way , because it leans back too far for me . It sits next to my acoustic guitar , and does n't look right , one way back and the other up straight . lol
5 #### Excellent product at a great price . Thank you for having what I needed , when I needed it , and having great shipping and handling too .
5 #### What a time saver ! . This packer works great . Heavy duty construction . I can pack a new bearing in about 20 seconds - and pack it well ( much better than I ever did or could by hand ) .
1 #### Been doing guitar work for 45 years . Used to sell for a few different string manufacturers . I do NOT like these strings . Bought them for a customer 's guitar , her request . Guess what ? I still do n't like them .
3 #### They are too light and do n't really hold well on your ears but they are decent for the price and has a longer cable them most
1 #### Would only work if you physically hold it in place : _ ( I would definitely suggest you do not bother buying this .
4 #### Works great unless it gets twisted at which point it will rub against your neck .
2 #### This unit sports a micro usb connector this is what ended up breaking on mine they are very flimsey . The case makes it hard to move the ring / silent switch . Over time the case will leave nice vertical scrapes on the back of the iphone . Battery life is only so so at $ 80.00 I would not consider this accessory a very good deal .
5 #### Exactly what is needed to maintain the K&N air filter I have .
4 #### A while back , I sent two of my Ovations back to the factory in Connecticut for re - work ( I just plain wore them out ) , and they came back to me with the EXP16 strings on them . After I played them for a little while , I called the factory and said " thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars , and by the way , these are the best sounding strings I 've ever played , what exactly are they ? " Recently , I sent my 12 string Ovation Adamas back to Connecticut for a new bridge ( that 's just something to expect eventually on a 12 string ) , and it came back with the EXP38s on it . As before , these are the best sounding strings I 've ever had on this guitar . Turns out , the EXP16s are the factory recommended strings for Ovation 6 string acoustics , and the EXP38s for their 12 strings . I wish they would offer a subscription price for these 38s like they do for the 16s .
5 #### I read reviews about this being a safer option for an acoustic guitar strap support than the usual tie - device . Working just fine so far , came quickly in the mail .
5 #### I was always a Shure buyer . They 're good microphones but I tried the Sennheiser and it is clearer and far superior in quality . I recommend it .
5 #### My daughter absolutely loved it . I wish I could have been the at Christmas to watch her use it . Very nice
4 #### I hope to never find out how awesome the protection probably is on this case . I 've had it a week , and I was instantly impressed with the design and fit . This is my fourth Otterbox case ( the others went on Blackberries ) . The only reasons I did n't give 5 stars are because I 've never been crazy about the attached plugs that go into the charger and mic holes , and the included screen protector does not use water to install so you only have one shot to get the it positioned correctly , or it 's probably going in the trash . Otherwise , it 's awesome .
5 #### The first time I used the sealant I knew that it would be the only one that I would buy as it works the best another great product from locktite
3 #### I have n't had any problems with the guitar so I guess the sponge is doing its job . It dries up pretty quickly though , so you have to get it wet every three days or so . I like that it sits in the strings without touching my guitar while it 's hanging on the wall .
5 #### Like an old friend . I have used Regular Slinkys for years on all of my electrics . Even though necks and sounds change , my fingers always know what strings they like .
1 #### Purchased 2 of them . Dead in the water . They never work . What a disappointment ........ money wasted . Now I ca n't use my keyboard .
4 #### Works as advertised . Nothing fancy , just basic , acceptable headphones . Very lightweight .
4 #### I liked the Nook Simple Touch that I purchased and the price was right , but I purchased this model by mistake . I thought it had the glow light and it did n't ( my bad ! ) . The company took it back without a problem and charged me a minimal restocking fee . Thanks for understanding !
5 #### works well , i recharged many times . can charge samsung galaxy s3 about 2 times or may more partially charge
4 #### I really love the sound of this drum head . It 's still not 100 % what I am looking for but it 's 98 % of the way there .
3 #### Used for an install in a 1995 F150 . A lot of material to fill an 1/8 inch gap .
1 #### Just like any dash kit from Walmart this is terrible quality , breaking the tabs I needed to , to make it fit the holes was very hard , but breaking the ones I needed to keep by accident was all too easy , I do n't recommend this or sosche
4 #### I use this on my Thule T2 bike hitch on longer trips to keep it from shaking around excessively . My only grip is how ridiculous it is . It 's a piece of plate , two bolts , two washers , two lock washers , and a u - bolt . Should be about $ 12 . Held off on buying it for a long time , but finally took the plunge . I 'm happy , but GAH $ $ $ $ $ $ !
5 #### Renewed my RV 's finish but will take you some time and some work
5 #### This is absolutely the best and most essential accessory to have for your bluetooth wireless headset . I just love it to death ! ! ! Thanks Amazon .
5 #### Love seeing my guitar on the wall ! This is a nice and easy way to get your guitar out of harms way . Highly recommend it .
5 #### I can not remember a time when I did not use D'Addario strings . I have been playing for over 40 years . I have tried most other brands , ( nothing wrong with any of them ) , but I ended up with D'Addario and have not changed . I use 9 's and 10 's depending on the guitar that I am playing .
3 #### Works pretty well . My only complaint is that the batteries do n't last more than 6 months .
3 #### Certainly not a state of the art pedal but adecuate if your needs are based more on coloring your guitar sound . The expression / range on the pedal is not that great and if you want to spice your solos with the wah wah effect , I recommend you look somewhere else . One of the things I did n't appreciate is that you have to lean your whole body on the pedal to switch back and forth if you 're sitting . The price is adequate for these basic features but I definitely recommend going for a better pedal .
3 #### Worked as expected and quick delivery . It does affect the hand warmer on that side
4 #### This worked great for me on all windows based systems I have used it with many HP printers without any driver conflicts . I have also used it with all my upgrades ( win98 - winXP ) without any problems . It is fully configable with all the settings I have needed ( DHCP , Static IP , SMTP , daisy chaining ect ... And I like to try all the settings ! If you are printing to different printers from any number of computers in a TCP / IP network or Windows domain this is for you . It was a little slow on the large print jobs . Someone in a large printing enviroment should look to something with some built in memory . It also does appletalk , NETBUI and IPX / SPX . I will be trying the bi - directional ( scanners ) stuff very soon .
1 #### The wall charger fried my phone . Enough said . Only afterwards did I hear that aftermarket chargers would do that on the LG Vue phone in particular . Never had the chance to try the car charger . The USB cable connection seemed to work okay , however , I never got a chance to set up the software that come with it ( not plug and play ) .
5 #### Work wonders I have an 2001 F150 Super Cab and it really brought back the running boards and the rest of the exterior trim to looking newer . I keep up with my truck with this product once ever couple of weeks so it has taken less product to maintain it , I also have a 2012 escape and use it on that same application sequence . Keeps both vehicles looking good and we get a lot of compliments .
5 #### love that i do n't have to go out to find it ... and that i get it in the mail love it .
5 #### Used this to mount a 100 watt solar panel to my pop up camper . I 've taken it on the interstate several times and have never had any problems . If you read the camper sites , this is what many companies are using to mount solar panels to their RV 's . I was worried at first but if you let the product cure , the panel will not come off . You will remove part of the roof first .
5 #### An inexpensive , light - weight retrofit that delivers a luxury experience . The looks wo n't win any prizes but even so the off - white plastic design is not offensive and in anything less than a high - end bathroom is all you need .
5 #### I have a ring finger missing on left hand . I choose these strings for tone and ease of using bar chords . They do have a higher pitch . Sound is good .
5 #### Fantastic . Dries very well . For those that think it should be a 100 % streak free dry go elsewhere . That is not how a shammy works . A shammy will dry most of the water but not all and you will always have a small wipe up with your favorite microfiber . However it wo n't be much wiping with your microfiber . I highly recommend this product it is a time saver .
5 #### While definitely not for everyone , this is the absolute best case I 've found - for my use . It makes the phone about 3 times thicker , but will protect from bumps , drops , and just about anything else . I do n't use the belt clip - it 's big , but slides in my pocket . It 's easy to hold - you will not drop this . It 's like a spare tire , wrapped around the phone . Again , not for everyone , but for anyone looking for a way to protect this incredible device - you 'll want this !
4 #### keeps the road grime and rock damage to a minimum . could match existing holes better , but only took 10 minutes to install each side
2 #### Returned to Amazon . Crackling sound is very noticeable on one side of the headphones . Also volume is a bit too low , I had to turn up the volume to hear most of my music .
1 #### Sound quality : Decent . Comfort : Not good , but bearable . Travel Durability : Abysmal . Like , I went on one trip and one of the earpieces broke off at the cheap plastic pins that hold it on to the frame . I had a pair of Sony 's that I owned for three years and went on twenty trips with no problem . Eventually the cord got frayed and I had to replace it with this piece of garbage . Maybe I just had bad luck . Probably not though . On my flight back , sitting between fat hick who decided to invade my seat space with passive aggressive knee touching which does n't work with my crusty former Marine mentality ( I turned that row into a warzone with that idiot ) and a neurotic aged Woody Allen type who had diarrhea of the mouth and could n't shut up I reached for my trusty noise killers . Only to discover to my horror that the cheap P.O.S. had broken . If somebody 's little Damien had been wailing behind me like my last trip it would have been unbearable .
5 #### i love this stuff . Strings feel softer and smell sweet .
3 #### these cards are not even long enough to charge and talk on . Not happy with the cords being so short
5 #### These are very lightweight and have a great sound for the price range of them ! I got these for my daughter , who is forever losing / breaking her earbuds , and I 'm happy that she is very happy with them . They are light , soft , and put out a great sound for everything she needs from her phone .
5 #### Been looking for a 15 ' MIc cable for a while . Usually come 10',20.25 ' etc . Ordered it . Shipped and received quickly . Use it for my gigs . No problem . Would buy again .
5 #### I underestimated it , I thought it would be cheap and bend easily , but I was wrong .
4 #### I 'm not a serious CB user ( I use ham and GMRS , mostly ) but this is pretty handy to stick in the pickup when I 'm pulling the travel trailer for a road trip or camping . Range was about what you 'd expect ( without skip about the best you can get on CB is around 4- 5 miles with a decent antenna ) with a 4 ft . antenna . Do n't be too disappointed with radio activity- CB is n't what it used to be , what you 'll mostly get is truck drivers if you 're on the freeway , and just about nothing anyplace else , although I did pick up a couple of drug dealers conversing in Spanish a few days ago . Recommended if your intention is to have it around in your vehicle for road info ..
5 #### The OtterBox Defender case is a MUST HAVE - you are bound to drop you phone at least one time while you own it and it will save your phone . The 3 G case is a bit bulkier compared to the 4 G case - but it is still well worth it and the case looks great .
5 #### Tough to replace these , and greasy dirty . I did both hinges on both front doors ; the rear doors were fine ; obviously not as much use . I followed 1A Autos video which made it easier . The pins seem a bit long but the knurled shaft near the top made a tight fit . The retaining clip is rectangular but did snap into the groove . Yes , be careful putting in the bronze bushings ; like mentioned before they can be brittle . The spring reinstallation was a learning curve the way 1A Auto did it with zip ties . I went through several at first . All in all I like how these work & the door does n't sag or make that scraping sound when opened or closed . I hope these last another 20 + years too ! I guess I would recommend these . I 'll see how they last and , if needed , update .
5 #### These are the best strings ever . I 've tried almost every string on the market , and these are by far my favorite . They sound great and last forever . Believe the hype ... they really DO last FAR longer than any other strings , and they sound great while doing it . Many other strings will sound great for a short while , but as soon as they get " gunked up " , they lose any brilliance and tone , and become dead sounding . Not these . They will sound great for the life of the string . In fact , the only way I know to change them eventually is not because they stop sounding good ( which they do n't ) , but because I 'll start having intonation problems and I know the strings need to be changed . Normal wear and tear does that , but these strings last SO long . I 've tried the polyweb strings from Elixir as well , but I did n't like those at all . To me , they did n't FEEL right . Sticky or something ( not like your fingers stick to the strings , but like you could tell they were coated ) . With the Nanowebs , they sound AND feel like regular strings , but last forever . The only string I 'll use .
5 #### Add on to my mic stand so I have picks at the ready . Seems durable enough and slipped right on with ease .
3 #### Not bad jack stands . I like the locking pin feature . It gives an increased sense of security while under the vehicle . The reviews about poor quality welds applied to one of my jack stands . But , the welds are not bad enough to make the stands unsafe to use . They just point out the use of low quality labor and low standards = inexpensive jack stands .
5 #### For the price you pay these are pretty good headphones . Fit better than most in your ears and last FOREVER . Not the best you will find but for listening to books or music on walks or traveling they work perfect .
5 #### love this i m a photographer and i shoot in film and film in general is very expensive so this is a great deal and its great quality
