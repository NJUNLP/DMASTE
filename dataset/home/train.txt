Ok I was very pleased to get and install these parts in my band saw . Makes the saw muc more versatile . Having said that one size does not really fit all . Yes the parts fit . Disassembly and reassembly are straight forward . Would have helped to have a friend in order to help hold and balance the upper wheel while tryig to install the retaining bolt . But they did a poor job relocating the power switch . It would no merely bolt back on as it had originally . The holes in the rizer were not located properly . I could have drilled through the switch mounting bracket and used 1 screw to secure it . I chose to add 1 / 4 ply to the original holes , and mount switch to that .####[([-1], [3, 6], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [28, 32], 'NEG'), ([36], [37], 'NEU'), ([39], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([41], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([79, 80], [75, 77], 'NEG'), ([95, 98], [100, 102], 'NEG')]####Tools_and_Home_Improvement

I recently got and installed this in our chimney . It worked pretty well , but didn 't perfectly seal around the flu handle and the edges . I ended up stuffing grocery bags in any spot that wasn 't perfectly sealed and that seemed to do the trick . Also note that in my case I thought the main culprit for heat loss was air escaping up through my chimney , but it turned out that it was a poorly sealed fresh air intake in the floor of my fireplace that was pouring the cold air into my basement . So stuffing that with some insulation and using aluminum duct tape made a bigger difference then this did .

Wanted a good one of this size to carry on board a recent cruise . An old cheapy version was the one I carried first putting this in the big checked bag .

Amazon wouldn 't ship it free ( I 'm a Prime member ) saying that , because this is an "add -on item " shipping would be too expensive unless I spent $25 in Prime purchases .

The "slide button " controls the intensity from Off to fully On , with a small , red , adjacent LED that glows with the degree of setting . When your lamp is turned off , the LED is bright , when your lamp is fully lit , the LED is off .

I don 't have too many empirical ways to test this filter , but based on the fit and feel , I like it better than what we were using . The house had filters already installed with some extras for each register . They were very flimsy , and made of a blue plastic material . These Filtrete filters are heavier and not appear to be nearly as porous . We have folks with allergies in the family and want to make sure we 're getting the air as filtered as possible . We also have two dogs that shed , which affects the downstairs filter pretty quickly .

As a general contractor , I can judge the quality of a subcontractor typically with the tools that they equip themselves with . Poor quality tools , produce lesser quality work . Stabila produces the best quality levels out there ; bar none . The construction of the tools is flawless , after years of use (and occasional abuse ) they 're still as accurate and flaw free as when I got them . The paint is extremely rugged , having zero dings or scratches as of yet . I use only Stabila levels , as do every other carpenter I work with . I would highly recommend this brand of level , specifically these box beam levels . They 're a great tool that you 'll have for life .####[([32], [33, 37], 'POS'), ([45], [50], 'POS'), ([48], [64], 'POS'), ([48], [66, 67], 'POS'), ([75], [77, 78], 'POS'), ([75], [81, 82], 'POS'), ([75], [81], 'POS'), ([-1], [105, 107], 'POS'), ([123], [122], 'POS')]####Tools_and_Home_Improvement

This table is great . I have limited space for doing woodworking so I needed something that provided quality but was light enough to move around . This table fits the bill . I was concerned about the bottom being made of plastic . It is actually very sturdy and still fairly light to move . The table its self has several adjustment points to make sure the table , fence , and router are all true to each other . The surface is also large enough that it is not awkward to run larger pieces on . I used this table with a craftsman plunge router . It easily mounted to the table and was up an running no time . If you only have 1 router and may need to take your router in and out it is very easy to do once the initial set up was completed . It doesn 't take much know how to put everything together but they do also provide a good set of instructions for assembly and adjustment .

Probably one of the best blades on the market for commercial wood production . It is fast , it is sharp and the quality is good enough to warrant resharpening when needed .

I never buy cooking stuff made from aluminum yet despite the stainless steel in the name of this product , the description says it is pure aluminum .

The Marcato came highly recommended . I decided since I only used it at Christmas , I would make an exception to my no aluminum rule . Despite that I HATE its aluminum construction , the cookie press is well made and has held up to the stiff dough I use for cookies each Christmas . If only they truly used stainless steel for the construction of this press , I would be telling everyone I know to buy it . This press contains a wide variety of discs for a wide variety of cookies .

So , far I am happy with this coffee maker . Mine came with three mystery parts (see photo ) which are not covered in the tiny , eye -squinting instruction pamphlet , nor any photo or description on the box . I think will figure it out , though . * * * PS I made a few trial runs and discovered that boiling water in a glass pot requires less energy to do so than in metal pots . A lower setting gets the job done and can lower the risk of the glass pot shattering . I do remember my chemistry classes whereby removing glass , pyrex included , from high temperature quickly is enough of a shock to cause glass to shatter . So , it may take a little longer using a lower heat setting but the flavor outcome of the coffee is well worth the wait .####[([8, 9], [5], 'POS')]####Home_and_Kitchen

I recent bought a bread machine last year and was having issues slicing the bread and almost continually slicing my fingers off , so instead of buying bread with lots of "stuff " in it from the store , or for a doctors new BMW , I tried to find a solution to bread cutting . I searching amazon high and low for a bread slicer and came across this one and decided to give it a go , and after using it for a month or so , I have to say I like it , but I am not in love with it . One problem I see in the future , if my hand slips with the knife , is me breaking a peg on the side , because they are just plastic . Other than that small problem , this bread slicer does it job and helps me cut perfect slices of bread for my fresh made bread .####[([-1], [94], 'POS'), ([-1], [100, 103], 'NEU'), ([126, 129], [124], 'NEG'), ([-1], [134, 135], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [150, 154], 'POS')]####Home_and_Kitchen

The Microplane 40001 zester is amazing . The lemon was completely naked in 10 seconds flat ! Hardly any pressure was needed when zesting .

I had a blender just like this one for several years and it finally died . I liked that Waring was a trusted brand , so I bought a new one (the Professional Quality one ) in mid - April and this new one did not even last 2 months . Note : I only used this unit 1 -2x a week to make smoothies . Yesterday , it gave up and quit in a blaze of glory .with the requisite smoke billowing out of the base . When I first started using it , it would heat up while I blended , which I thought was a little strange , and the speed would adjust up and down .

It is a wonderful grill for 1 or 2 people , if you don 't have a fancy cooktop or range that comes with a grill . I used it to make salmon teriyaki and the salmon came out real tender on the inside , with a nice grilled flavor . Cleaning is not too bad either as the nonstick surface seems to be permanently in tact . The only thing I wondered about this grill is why the drip pan was a flimsy white plastic and not aluminum or stainless steel . Although oil cools fast , I found myself worrying that the plastic would melt as soon as the oil dripped onto it .

Bought a Best Price Mattress 4 - Inch Memory Foam Mattress Topper , Twin size to use on the couch when an extra bed is needed . The topper was 6 inches too wide to fit properly on the couch . Being 4 inches thick made it too much to try cutting with scissors . I could not find anything in my voluminous supply of tools that would cut this topper so I decided that I would try using an electric knife so I bought this Cuisinart . . I used a felt tip to draw a line six inches from one side . I placed the topper on the dining room table and cranked up the electric knife . Using the bread knife blade option this Cuisinart CEK -40 cut quickly and smoothly and left me with a topper that fits my couch perfectly . I was able to complete my mission with a moderately priced tool that worked with very little effort on my part and for a moderate price .####[([122, 124], [130, 133], 'POS'), ([157], [155, 156], 'POS'), ([157], [159, 163], 'POS'), ([171], [170], 'POS')]####Home_and_Kitchen

Finally found something that works to break up and brown ground beef ! Although not actually a fork , this tool is strong enough to do the job without bending out of shape , and actually works faster and easier than the old , truly sturdy , 3 tine granny fork . I had a 3 tine cooking fork for over 25 years that I used for everything , until the handle broke , and since it wasn 't full tang , I couldn 't replace the handle . I 've searched for years for another 3 tine fork , but the ones I 've found just aren 't made like they used to be . They work fine for turning light -weight meat or testing potatoes , but try to break up and brown ground beef and they 'll bend , tines and tang ! This tool is strong , but has just enough flex to manipulate well . The tines look odd because they are made slightly offset , but the shape makes them work more efficiently . Just got the granny fork yesterday , and after one use I was very impressed with it . I can see already that I will be using it for a lot more than just browning ground beef . I 'd give this tool 10 stars because it is made to last !####[([-1], [4, 11], 'POS'), ([36], [37], 'POS'), ([36], [39], 'POS'), ([-1], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([147], [149], 'POS'), ([155], [153, 154], 'POS'), ([161], [168, 169], 'NEG'), ([161], [176, 178], 'POS'), ([183, 184], [193, 194], 'POS'), ([-1], [204, 206], 'POS'), ([222], [228, 230], 'POS')]####Home_and_Kitchen
This is a great little one -cup maker - - BUT - - I 've purchased a total of 3 of these . The first one seemed to work well and I gave it to my son when he was away at college .

I bought this over a year ago and still looks and works like new . My family loves spritz cookies and I wanted a cookie press that would hold up to my baking needs . I have five kids so there is a lot of baking going on in my house . Putting it together is easy . Filling the tube is the most difficult part and that is not as hard as rolling out dough , cutting out cookies and putting them on the cookie sheet without mishapping them . Fill the tube and you can fill a half sheet cookie sheet full of larger (they are still small cookies but gives you a choice of not as much dough coming out or more dough coming out . ) cookies before having to refill .

I 've tried using this a few times unsucsessfully . First , the dough immediately retracts to whatever shape it was before you pressed it .

I just received my waffle iron today and used it as soon as it arrived . I 've never owned a waffle iron so I can 't compare it to another one . However this waffle iron made the most delicious waffles ever . I used 3 / 4 cup and it was the perfect amount . The first one I let cook for 5 minutes and 30 seconds and it was overcooked not soft at all almost like a toast . The second one I let cook for exactly 3 minutes and 40 seconds and it was chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside but not too crunchy . It takes a few times to find out the exact time to get the waffles to your liking . I didn 't spray the waffle iron and they came out with ease . I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to anyone .

This timer beeps until you shut it off . I can hear it from another room . It is fairly intuitive to use .

Very sharp blades and easy to use in wide open areas , but doesn 't work well when branches or trunks are close together , like crepe myrtles , because you have to spread the handles wide apart to encircle the branch and there 's not enough room at times to do that . Therefore , I also ordered the Fiskars shorter handled lopper to use in those cases . The longer handled one easily cuts branches with a 2 " diameter .####[([2], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([2], [4, 6], 'POS')]####Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

I had an older Ross Root feeder several years ago , but lost in in a home move . The old one was built like a tank - all metal - tough as nails and I thought I might regret getting this newer model . The head of the unit is all plastic and I was skeptical that it would last , but I needed to feed some citrus trees in my yard . The new feeder arrived and I 'm impressed . Yes , the unit is plastic , but it is sold and sturdy . I 've had to really lean on this to get it to penetrate some dry patches around my trees and there is no sign of weakness or bending .

I have several 18V batteries to use with this blower , several power tools and two brush hog weed whackers so it 's not as bad about it going through a battery so quickly .

I really like this axe a lot . Works well for splitting and chopping and cuts considerably faster than any other axe I 've ever used . I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because this thing absolutely kills my hands . I 've used many wood handles and a fiberglass (yellow plastic looking ) handle on my old maul . The Fiskars gives me the most hand pain by far . I don 't notice it while I 'm using it but the next 2 - 3 days are brutal . Maybe it 's because the head speed is higher and it 's causing more impact forces to go into my hands or maybe the handle just doesn 't absorb the vibrations very well .

We built a chicken coop in our backyard earlier this year and noticed that we started getting more flies as the weather got warmer . Since the coop isn 't too far away from our deck and grill , it became increasingly annoying to do anything near our favorite spots . We purchased this product after reading many reviews and are certainly glad we did . We hung the trap with butcher 's twine after filling with water as instructed . We decided to place the trap behind our shed and closer to our compost bin rather than hanging directly onto the coop itself . The smell that emits after a few days is quite strong with the right wind . We didn 't notice any smells otherwise , I 'd say because of its placement behind the shed .

The barbeque and cover survived , but the muddy cover wasn 't worth spending time to resurrect . When I found the same cover on Amazon , I purchased it . It fits the large barbeque with side burner and has velcro ties on each side for a custom fit and to keep it from coming off in the wind . So far , it has survived heavy winds , rains , and its first blizzard . The price is right , and I highly recommend it .####[([-1], [65, 71], 'POS'), ([111], [113], 'POS'), ([-1], [117, 118], 'POS')]####Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

Highly recommended .####[([-1], [15, 17], 'POS'), ([49], [51, 52], 'POS'), ([-1], [91, 92], 'POS')]####Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

I purchased 8 of these and had to give a star otherwise there would be none but I did learn a lesson . We had a massive number of moths appear almost overnight and our house was full , they were everywhere . A white ceiling looked dark there were so many . I set these traps out and in four days I caught one ( 1 ) single moth . I do believe it was an accident on his part taking a wrong turn and getting stuck inside . I would not try them again having checked locally finding them 30 % cheaper before shipping . So look at your local hardware stores but not for these I wouldn 't hit a dog in the back side with these . Ask what is good and in a day you will be moth free . We bombed the whole house and vacuumed them up . End of story .####[([-1], [91, 95], 'NEG'), ([-1], [119, 128], 'NEG')]####Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

This stuff works great with the larger flies you find around the house or farmyard - not so well with these little flies we have here in Washington State that are about half that size and orbit around in calm wind areas in a loose cloud . The big house files gobble this stuff up and die almost immediately . There are piles of them around my bait stations . It is really quite amazing , compared to some sprays I have tried . The little flies I mentioned eventually land , eat it and die , but not nearly as fast and in as great a number as the larger ones . This stuff really reeks - I guess it has to , to draw in the flies . Stand back when you open the container : - ) Painting it on as per instructions did not work so well - I recommend bait stations instead .

I had read that some of these are too high to fit many grills . So I got this and it barely fit between the burner shield and the grill , but it did fit and smokes up a storm . I was just out looking at the grill in the garage ; we have winters here , and this box was left in the grill and has a lot of rust from cold damp air .

This trap did exactly what I needed it to do -caught the squirrel that has been living in my garage for some time now . I got tired of cleaning up it 's nest (paper , cardboard , etc . . . ) and ordered this product . Trap arrived quickly (as usual in my experiences with Amazon .com -keep it up , DON ' T disappoint me ) . Set it that night with bait of peanut butter on a slice of wheat bread . Came out the next morning and my litte friend was waiting for me . . .good thing that he ate up because we were going on a little road trip . Placed trap in a cardboard box as suggested by another reviewer to calm it down -which it did . A short time and a few miles later and my little grey friend now resides in the next county . Only negative is that opening the cage to release it was tricky , but to be fair , I did have my iphone in one hand to record the moment .

Peanut butter seems to be the universal recommendation when trying to catch rats and mice , so that 's what I used and whaddaya know , CLANG ! Had our fella within 5 minutes of setting the trap and retiring to the other room . . .more to come , I 'm sure . This wasn 't the cheapest option but I figured for the least mess , well worth it . Didn 't want to use poison for fear of them dying in my walls and stinking up the place for months , and kill traps can be pretty gruesome in terms of bodily fluids and other internal parts . Considered trying an electronic ultrasonic rat repellent until I googled it and found that they basically don 't work , according to most people who 've used and tested them .

I finally lost my patience after the deer ate all of the buds off of my Oriental lilies just as they were about to bloom . They had already wrecked hundreds of other plants , but this was the last straw . The stinky repellents worked for awhile , but I had to keep my windows closed for a couple of days after I sprayed , and eventually the deer got used to the taste . This ScareCrow Motion Activated Animal Repellent is the ONLY thing that consistently keeps the deer out of my flower beds . It really doesn 't care who or what it squirts . It 's gotten my husband twice , plus the Fed Ex and UPS guys . I really need to buy a timer for it . My first Scarecrow lasted for three seasons . I took it inside and took the battery out every fall before the first heavy frost , then hooked it up again in late spring .

I have some very determined squirrels and rats that live in our yard . This is the only feeder that has consistently defeated them . They climb the pole and bite at the baffle but are unable to do anything else , drop off and wander away dejected . It is also rainproof so there is no gross mold or seedlings that have to be cleaned out . It is a hit with the birds , even scrub jays try to bend down to get at the holes . The only negative is that the birds tend to throw the seed out onto the ground because there are no catchment dishes (if there was it wouldn 't be as rainproof I guess ) but I changed from millet to sunflower seeds and it seems less of an issue .

My cheap loppers had gone dull , and because I 'm a senior citizen living in the woods , I have to have something that will do the job without lots of effort . I know Fiskars as a quality brand , so I read many reviews before choosing this model 9146 and I am thrilled with my choice . Many models apparently have a wide handle spread ; this model is absolutely perfect . A lightweight unit with perfect handle spread so I can get underneath those pesky box elder growths with ease . These don 't have the fancing gearing , but they don 't need it . For anyone wanting a lightweight power cutter , this is the one !####[([36], [39, 40], 'POS'), ([50, 51], [55], 'POS'), ([70], [72, 73], 'POS'), ([77], [76], 'POS'), ([80, 81], [79], 'POS'), ([100, 101], [96, 98], 'NEU'), ([115, 116], [114], 'POS')]####Patio_Lawn_and_Garden
Whenever I am in the market for a new bird feeder I always look to see what 's new , hoping for "a better mousetrap " . However , I just about always end up with a Droll Yankee product . I have bought at least a dozen over the last 15 or so years and they are all in service . Yes , they are a little pricey , but quality always is . Their products perform as promised ( I have a Yankee Flipper that drives the squirrels nuts ! ) and their customer service is the best . As for this particular feeder , I really like it . It a simple yet effect way to keep not only squirrels but larger birds away from the seed . I like large birds too , but often they chase off the little guys (Kinglets , various Finches , Nuthatches , etc . ) . I have other feeders for the Blue Jays , Woodpeckers and Doves , this one is for the rest of the flock . I just wish that the capacity was a little greater but still it 's a wonderful feeder .####[([95, 96], [98, 99], 'POS'), ([105], [107, 109], 'POS'), ([195], [194], 'POS')]####Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

This is a great hummingbird feeder . It is strong , sturdy and well made . The clear glass bottle is less likely to get moldy than opaque plastic reservoirs . All plastic parts are simple to clean between fills , which is important . Filling is very easy . Hummingbirds have been enjoying their sugar water here since late Spring . Now that migration is occurring , there are more coming and going . I am so happy that I purchased this feeder . We (the hummingbirds & me ) are very pleased !

This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased . I bought one last year and then again one this year . ( The first one still works great ) I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges . So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in . Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature . As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string .

With a fairly small lawn , an electric mower appealed to me . With the flip handle , this one is not too bad . You need to plan your mowing pattern carefully and yank on the cord once in a while . If you have trees and shrubs and flower beds it gets even more interesting . The power is a bit on the weak side though and in tough grass it bogs down . My teen ager is not too impressed with it . It probably takes us 30 % longer to mow the lawn than with a cheap gas mower . Over all , I do like it . It is fairly quiet and it does not smell like oil and gas and that is a big plus .

I bought this birdbath after having trouble finding a free -standing one that had a large enough capacity to not quickly evaporate dry in the Mid - Atlantic coast 's summer while being tall enough to be seen from my back windows . This fit the bill with its deep bowl and was very easy to install (screwdriver required , no other tools ) . It 's just as easy to empty as advertised , also . On the negative side , since it mounts on a deck railing , it might be higher than your local birds are used to looking for water . It took several weeks for our birds to discover and start using it . Highly recommended if you don 't have a convenient spot to put a typical pedestal -mounted birdbath or need the convenience of being able to easily dump out a birdbath .
