The PC1131 has a 4 . 3 gallon double hotdog tank system .

I own two of these and bought a few as Christmas gifts ! No longer do I have to believe manufacturer 's specs . I can see usage on my own ! Another great feature is letting you know how much voltage you have at your outlet .

I found the handles of these spoons very difficult to hang on to , or handle , especially if your hands are wet . They have an odd bend in the handle . I had my husband pound them til the handles were flat and straight . Now they are usable . I am still not fond of them , as they feel unbalanced or something , when I use them , but will do .

I will be using mine frequently this summer on my grill ! I also really like that they are made of metal which in my opinion will make the much more durable than my old ones that had plastic on the tips . ( I have had a ton of issue with ones with plastic on the tip that picks up , my old plastic pieces fell off while I was cooking on the grill , so these not having that makes them an automatic win in my book ! ! ! I also really enjoy that they have a lock on the top of them ! makes it easier to store them ! ! Overall I would give this a 10 out of 10 being that I find them perfect for everyday cooking ! Disclosure : I received this product either complimentary or significantly discounted in exchange for my honest unbiased review of the product .

Good size , like that it is see -through . It does the job and I love the fact that I don 't have to use paper plates and towels anymore to cover food , My only gripes are : 1 ) found same thing at Walmart for cheaper ( I 'm ok with that though because who has time to shop and my 'find ' there was purely accidental ) . Did not like the fact that it has no handle and believe a better design would be a decent size handle with a vent placed to the side . I say this because the lid can be quite hot when first take it out - if heating something that produces a lot of steam . Counter -point would be let it rest a minute or so before taking off lid . Only problem is I usually only use microwave when in desperate hurry . : - ( I know , I need to stop that !####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([-1], [7, 8], 'NEU'), ([-1], [3], 'POS'), ([-1], [11, 13], 'POS'), ([-1], [16], 'POS'), ([46], [48], 'NEU'), ([-1], [79, 81], 'NEU'), ([-1], [72, 74], 'NEG')]####Home_and_Kitchen

This is a high quality product and it stands up to anything I throw at it including cinnamon sticks . My only complaint is that I bought it specifically to freshly grate cinnamon into coffee and it 's not quite fine enough to get the cinnamon to dissolve .

You fill it half way , put on the top and then you use the top cap to pump and pump till you build up pressure inside the lower chamber . When you then take off the cap it sprays very fine like PAM spray . You really can 't replicate this any other way and the result is probably better for cooking . Once pumped up you can 't fit the cap down again unless you relieve the pressure . That is one problem . It also hasn 't broken but it 's very light and I suspect it may have a limited lifespan .

Amazingly well constructed , exceeded expectations , and is so easy to use - clean - store . I almost did not order , based upon a few recent negative reviews about the power level . After my scientist -engineer brain kicked in and ran a few calc 's to determine the calculated heat at 120 -volts versus 110 -volts , I realized that they may not have been following manufacturers recommendations . The problem they most likely were having was operating at 110 -volts rather than the REQUIRED 120 -volts . The manual clearly and in bold states that you MUST operate at 120volts to obtain full temperature . "Run , don 't walk " to purchase this unit , as it is perfect for a 2 - 4 person family .

Here 's what I love about this : Smooth , velvety , rich coffee with not a hint of bitterness . I haven 't had coffee this wonderful since my last trip to Europe .

You see , I 've tried them all : Electric , drip , espresso (remember : this is not espresso , but Moka ) , French Press , but never really hit the mark in terms of amazing coffee .

There are several things I like about this holder ; the size , the holes for drainage , that one side is deeper than the other , that the center comes off for cleaning . But the cleaning part is why I gave it 4 stars . It 's hard to keep clean even when using a scrubbing brush . It might be better if the middle piece didn 't come off because that 's the place I have the most trouble keeping clean . I use one side to hold my sponge and the other side to hold my stainless steel scrubbie for cleaning my cast iron cookware . I clean it every time I wash up things in the sink so at least daily and it still tries to get that nasty red mold growing in the bottom . In ONE DAY ! So you can see why I clean it every day and I use bleach as well . I think it 's the humidity here .

This is the second time I 've purchased these hoses the first ones after about a year are still going strong . The thing I like about these is they are 3 / 4 in ID and water volume is greatly enhanced over a 5 /8 inch hose . I typically use 2 one hundred foot hoses hooked together . Two 5 /8 inch hoses hooked together give a minimal amount of water flow . A three -quarter inch hose hooked on to the source and then with a 5 /8 inch hose attached to it give significantly better water pressure . Two three quarter inch hoses hooked together is like using a water cannon . Overall I 've been very impressed with the quality of these hoses . However they are not a non Kink hose .

I bought this mower because I didn 't want to deal with gasoline and the heavy weight of a power mower . Also because I 'm cheap and figured this was a way to spend less on my lawn and get a workout at the same time . My lawn is not too large , maybe 20 x 50 feet . The grass is fairly soft and thin . The mower cuts most of the grass reasonably well , but because the grass is soft and thin , it will sometimes miss blades that get pushed down by the wheels . This means I sometimes have to come back through with a rake to get the grass to stand up high enough to cut . When I 'm done mowing , it never gets that really clean look that a power mower will give you . Maybe it 's just something I have to get used to . The blades frequently jam on small twigs , which is a bit of a pain . To clear the jam , I tilt the mower sideways until it dislodges . I also wish the blades got closer to the edges of the lawn .

I am now 60 years old and since I pretty much cook for just my wife and I , I find this little grill the right size , once again . This size works well for a group of four , or less . This grill is made properly , and has been coated well with baked -on enamel paint ; should offer you years of use . I would recommend you spend the extra $ 10 and get the "Smokey Joe Gold " , over the "silver " model , simply because it comes with a chrome metal curved rod attachment that serves to lock the lid in place so you 're able to cary the WHOLE GRILL around , by the handle . This feature also helps while in transit , or when being stowed , which can prevent used ashes from being spilled . Also , this feature creates a place to rest the lid , when being used .

I should have realized we were going to have problems with these bird spikes when I opened the package and found several of the wire prongs rattling around loose in the box . It was easy to pop them out of their plastic setting , as our squirrel population soon learned . We screwed the strips to the top of the deck railing to keep the squirrels from jumping up onto the suet feeder , and bypassing the squirrel baffle . They soon figured out how to knock the spikes loose . Admittedly , these spikes are supposed to be for the birds , not the squirrels , but that doesn 't excuse their shoddy construction .####[([24, 25], [26, 31], 'NEG'), ([-1], [35, 43], 'NEG'), ([95], [97, 106], 'NEG'), ([115], [114], 'NEG')]####Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

It is getting harder and harder to find nozzles like this that have infinately variable spray , ranging from a fan to a steady stream just by squeezing the lever .

Gardeners ' Want It All : ' a single product that banishes all bugs and molds and fungi , while being environmentally friendly and Organic . Safer is the closest product we have had throughout my (long ) lifetime that ticks off most of these boxes . Spray vegetables with it and you can harvest as early as a day later . Plants DO get relief from many pests . Slugs and Tomato Horn -worms are not among them but this broad -spectrum , plant friendly pesticide ' pulls its weight ' in my garden year after year . The pre -mix bottles with their 'kitchen -familiar ' spray nozzle and handle is easy to use IF you have only a few precious plants to protect .

Works perfectly for my needs . We have been harnessing the water cast off by the AC in a very humid climac and are using it to water a small vegetable garden .

Been using this type shovel for years , lightweight , will not rust , great for moving snow . Everyone is sold out of shovels of this type because of the frequent snow storms . During the last storm my daughter broke her shovel so I gave her my spare grain hog scoop # 12 shovel . AMAZON had the type shovel I was looking for . I ordered two , one for dad , one for daughter . They arrived with the shovel scoop protected by a flattened cardboard box . Gave the scoop a coat of furniture polish , helps the snow to slide off . YUP 10 " of snow for tonight , the shovels arrived just in time . Very thankful that AMAZON had a supply of these shovels . So far this shovel has not cracked , perhaps the cold causes the scoop material to become brittle - do not know .
