First I LOVE THESE TIGHTS ! ! ! Beats pantyhose hands down , and they 're DURABLE . I 'm active , and usually get runs in pantyhose the first day . These I 've worn several times now , and not a hint of bagginess and not one teensy run . I 'm HAPPY ! I love the shimmer - - and I love the TOAST color , as I have pasty white legs . My only complaint - - according to the size chart , I should have fit into a size A (small ) . They easily stretched wide enough , but not long enough . The crotch rode a bit low , which was irritating . I gave them to my super -petite daughter , and she loves them . I loved them enough to get size B , and they 're PERFECT .

The attached photo shows the pilling and shedding of the surface of a Turtle Fur neck warmer that I wore about 8 times . As you can see , the fibers on the surface (which give it the unusually soft feel ) have come loose and are forming something like lint on the surface of the fabric . When I take the neck warmer off , balls of the lint cling to my face . I am still using the neck warmer , which is soft and comfortable , but I am using my fingers to pull the clumps of fibers from the surface , so they are not itchy and do not come off on my clothing and face . Knowing what I now know , I would not have purchased this neck warmer . I also bought a similar neck warmer sold by Carhartt , which is the same size , but it is less expensive and the fabric does not shed like this ; initially , it does not feel as luxurious , but in the long run , I prefer it .####[([30], [42, 44], 'NEG'), ([30], [47, 53], 'NEU'), ([66, 69], [70, 73], 'NEG'), ([80, 81], [87], 'POS'), ([133, 134], [128, 131], 'NEG'), ([80, 81], [85], 'POS'), ([80, 81], [87], 'POS')]####Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry

There is about a 1 / 2 inch of extra space from the tip of my big toe to the front of the shoe . That 's okay , though .

I love these , I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier ? ) and finally wore them out after several years . They are definitely a light -weight training shoe so I wouldn 't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running . But this also makes them extremely comfortable , I hadn 't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these . Good support and my feet stay cool all day , also noticeably light but well -made and long lasting . I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don 't really recommend it because the material is mesh -like and will let a lot of dirt in .

Great shoe . I 've had Nike 's before and have always been pleased with the comfort , performance , and quality . Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first , so I was nervous . But this turned out to be a great choice . Breathable , lightweight but sturdy , and comfortable during all my workouts . The built -in arch support is great and I 've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use . As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes , I would consider these a ' medium ' build (not thin , not overly thick ) so if you 're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration . Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning , but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient .

Perfect . An aluminum 1 liter water bottle in heavy black . Sigg bottles are well made , bisphenol -free , keep water cold , and function flawlessly . This is my second one . The first I had for years and loved , but was stolen when a thief took my bag on the train one day . This one is just as good as the last . Made from aluminum , they can dent if struck , but continue to function . They are a brilliant solution to the problem of carrying water . The screw top has a compliant seal that helps make the closure water tight every time . The cap is not secured in any way (one possible quibble ) . You could always secure it to the neck with some nylon string . The threads are fine and that sometimes makes it momentarily difficult to thread the cap on . The upside is excellent performance of the interface between aluminum bottle and plastic cap . Bottom line : a great bottle .

First impression is a pack of realy poorly sharpened heads . .like real dull . Its almost like the edge was from the steel being stamped out .

I love it ! ! ! I just can 't wait for it to finally break in . I use this mat every single day , and it is still taking a fair amount of time to break in .

Works good but I needed a lower resistance to get started . Did not take long before I was able to use it though .####[([0], [1], 'POS'), ([-1], [4, 10], 'NEG'), ([-1], [12, 21], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors
My last two (non -thorn -resistant ) tubes punctured immediately upon inflation - despite inspecting the inside rim meticulously for burrs , and being careful to avoid pinching - GAH - so I tried these - probably not the *right * solution , but it worked like a charm , been riding two of them for months . For those like me who haven 't installed a thorn -resistant tube before , its definitely a little more work to get it into the tire , and I 'm not looking forward to my next roadside patch , but with these tubes , it will probably be a while .####[([45], [46, 48], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors

Five star Due to price and quality construction of rod . use it for pier fishing , trying to cast far out there . I can understand what everyone is saying about the pieces sticking together and making it near impossible to remove . Just take some precautions prior to assembling the rod .####[([4], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([6], [0, 1], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors

Thought this was ok until I received another brand and compared . The Birchwood Casey cloth seems dry like an ordinary cloth . Leaves little or no silicone on object being wiped down .####[([-1], [3], 'NEU'), ([13, 15], [17], 'NEG'), ([-1], [23, 31], 'NEG')]####Sports_and_Outdoors
I had ordered this product a year ago and had put it away as soon as it received , upon cleaning my pantry i noticed it and immediately looked at it to see what the expiration date was , amazingly there is no date printed for expiration or mfg date or lot # . goes into the bin immediately . in the future i will definitely ask the seller for mfg /exp date info prior to purchase and validate upon receipt of item , what a waste . hope this doesnt happen to others looking to purchase this item####[([-1], [84, 86], 'NEG'), ([-1], [42, 49], 'NEG')]####Sports_and_Outdoors
Does the job exactly as it needs to be done in a quick and efficient manner . The hose attachment makes for easy handling of strange items (like a double end striking bag ) .####[([-1], [0, 9], 'POS'), ([18, 19], [22, 23], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors
