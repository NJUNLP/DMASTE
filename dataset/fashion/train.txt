After having purchased a competitive brand of jeans for years , and noticing their rapidly deteriorating product quality , went on line and explored other brands . Have had success with Carhartt jackets so , based on reviews , decided to try their jeans . Received what we ordered 32Wx30L which is what was worn in competitive brand . The product itself appears well made and of good quality . The jeans are much too tight so we have tried to initiate a return /replace procedure but cannot get the Amazon feature to work to accomplish that . If whoever reads this will get two pair of 34Wx30L shipped to us with return shipping tags , we will return the two we received . Eager to give them a try .

I ordered these based upon my waist size as specified in the size chart . Some people mentioned that they run small , and I was just on the upper edge of size 9 so I ordered size 10 . BIG mistake , they were huge . When they arrived the sizes shown on the factory package was hip size , which corresponds with my normal size of 8 , so I returned the size 10 and ordered size 8 and they fit perfect . Checking Amazon 's size chart which you will find on other panties will show you the correct sizing for these as is shown on their package . They are comfortable to wear , the leg openings stay in place and don 't ride up , and the fabric is a nice thick cotton . The elastic could be better , though , it is narrow and a bit scratchy . Maybe it will soften with more washings . Would be perfect if the manufacturer used a wider and softer elastic .####[([-1], [45], 'NEG'), ([82], [83], 'POS'), ([-1], [114], 'POS'), ([119, 120], [121, 123], 'POS'), ([119, 120], [125, 128], 'POS'), ([132], [135, 137], 'POS'), ([140], [141, 143], 'NEG'), ([140], [149], 'NEG'), ([140], [151, 153], 'NEG')]####Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry
If your job requires you to tuck in your shirt these probably aren 't your best option . I would instead go with Dockers or American Eagle or Old Navy .

I bought these for lifting at the gym , but since then I use them for that and also work and pretty much everything else . Unlike most of the other reviews I don 't believe that these are knockoffs , if they are they 're a damn good one . I do however belive that they may be a defect batch or an "outlet mall " batch bc of the fact most of the people - myself included - have either a small scuff or stain ; I mean mines just on the laces and I was going to relace them with black ones anyway so it 's not too big of a deal , and even if I wasn 't they 're going to get dirty anyway . The fit is pretty good , I purchased the size 8 forgetting about how wide they make them in hindsight I probably should 've got a 7 . 5 but they 're not too big to stress over - a thick sock will do the trick . Overall , they 're very nice and comfortable and I 'd probably buy them again .

I received my shoes yesterday and wore them to ballroom class today . The brand suggested to go a half size up from your street shoes , and since I am between a 9 . 5 and 10 , I decided to take chance and go for the 10 . When I buy my second my in a different color , I 'll be going 10 .5 . They were mostly cramped in the toe , but after two hours dancing in them my toes didn 't hurt much worse than when I first put them on . I expect after a few lessons and a chance to break them in , they 'll start to feel better . As for their purpose , I had no problems dancing in them : they were smooth enough to let me spin without issue and gave me traction so I wasn 't spinning out of control .

We gave this watch to our six -year -old girl once she had learned how to tell time . For about two weeks , she would not take it off except at bath time (it is waterproof ) . The wristband is easy to operate and has been dependable for us so far (we have had it for about a month ) ; the band will loosen over time , so we do need to cinch it up occasionally . The watch is attractive and keeps time accurately . It ticks softly every second , which I think is a good way of learning about the passage of time . There is a little flower that moves with the second hand - - very cute . There are two rows of numbers around the watch - - one set of the 1 to 12 numbers and also an outer set of 5 to 60 (by fives ) . This second set of numbers is what makes it so helpful for 'watch learners .

Very good overall . Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me . These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far . I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training , as well as work as a massage therapist ( I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated ) . If you 're a Go Walk fan , these do not offer the same level of cushion -comfort as those , HOWEVER , they offer the kind of long -term comfort to make them a durable option . The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable . My feet do not feel hot in them . Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training , I would not get them to do 25 ,000 steps in Walt Disney World .

These are a bit longer than they should be . I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8 . 5 . The width is accurate .

Also two grommets on each shoe is dark .

This was a gift for my 9 -yr -old grandson , and for the price , was expecting something screen -printed on thin nylon . Instead he got a heavy -duty woven nylon flag with the Bucs pirate flag sewn on it . It included stick -on plastic wall hooks for hanging . Those were cheap white plastic but we didn 't care , as we planned to use our own hooks to hang the banner . Buy it for the banner , forget the hooks .

I 've gone thru three of these types of mirrors over the last couple decades . One was stolen along with the bike it was attached to . 5 years later I bought another bike and put one of these on . That one ended up being attached to a cafe motorcycle build when I sold that bicycle . 8 years later , I 'm riding again , and this was the first addon purchase . Seems that these mirrors are getting better . My first one would need to be tightened if bumped too far during loading or unloading . This one , I can fold it in and out and not need to tighten it before each ride . Two weeks now without needing to reach for the allen key .

Just received these socks and they are terrible . The page doesn 't say anything at all about size and there is no way to select a specific size ( i guess that should have been a clue ) .

I 'm actually oping that I receive the wrong pair of socks . If not , this is pretty much a scam because they are not posting a size and the size that is received won 't fit most adults .

Bought this to carry on vacation in England because even my Leatherman Wave is not allowed there because the blades locking place (good luck defending yourself over there , but that 's for another print venue ) ! This item is very solid and well -made and , in my opinion , a bargain at $ 29 . The 2 -1 /2 " knife blade is extremely sharp - good enough to pass the slice -a -loose -sheet -of -paper test , and although the corkscrew looks small , it easily opened a bottle of wine for me (a priority ) . Some have complained of the matte finish on the handle for the Huntsman II version , but I personally like it better than the slick original finish . The only minus I can see is that some of the tools are difficult to open , even with my tough manly fingernails (those of you who get manicures , forget it ) .

Purchased this Nok Hockey and when it came it was in pieces , totally a shoddy job of construction , because the box was destroyed when un packing I was left to repair the game board the best I could with real screws and not the staples they used to assemble the board .

So far , real good . I have a large noggin - I get joked about it often . "El grande " . . . . . This fits me with room to spare . 23 " circumference noggin . ( Lotta brains ! ) . ONE thing users need to know , as I see it in some of the questions and reviews - there are the two side 'button ' sized adjusters . They help you set the side straps under the ear lobe . The little twist bar on the button DOES hold tension if you use it correctly - when the 'bar ' / knob is inline with the strap it is loose . Adjust the button , sliding it up and down or pulling the straps through to it where you want - then move the bar /knob on the button firmly and slowly so the bar /knob is perpendicular to the strap . You should feel a small amount of relief where the bar slips into or nests into the horizontal / perpendicular spot where it will keep the strap tight . It ain 't a $40 piece , so don 't expect superman grip , but it will work . See two photos . First , on left is LOCKED position . On the right is the UNlocked / adjustable position .

A decent set of glass on an attractively finished optic for an OK price . But here 's my thoughts , the eye relief is long , very very long , even for a pistol scope . The turrets for adjusting are stiff and their adjusters are made of a soft plastic with less than stellar tactile features making them even more difficult to adjust and leaving them damaged and marred by your finger nail ! Ridiculous . This scope does NOT include rings bare that in mind . The good would be packaging and manual and paperwork are all excellent with this scope . Really nice in fact .

I read the reviews about the FlexBar and I wanted to try anything that would make my "tennis elbow " go away . I 'm still not sure if it is Lateral Epicondylitis or just pain from the tricep , itself . Regardless , when I do push ups or any sort of isolated tricep workout , there would be pain in both of my elbows . I started doing the twist method on both of my arms starting with the green band . It does seem to help . I know that you need a couple of months to really have it work , but it really seems to be making it better . I 'll revisit this in a few months and report the progress . Even if you don 't have tennis elbow , you can use the FlexBar for strengthening your forearm . The same twist method builds that muscle , eccentrically . I 've since gone to the blue bar for more resistance . Start with the green or red , though .####[([-1], [85, 88], 'POS'), ([-1], [113], 'POS'), ([141], [143, 145], 'POS'), ([163, 164], [166, 167], 'NEU')]####Sports_and_Outdoors

The pads fits on my car , but the control tower does not fit it . I bought two sets of pads and one set of control towers and a pair of crossbars .

The tent itself isn 't too bad , considering how cheap it is .

It was so hot that I opted to sleep my friends hammock instead . 2 ) since it does require the stakes to be anchored about a foot from the actual tent , you may run into problems like I did - namely people tripping over the rope , yanking your tent down .

I have use this type mirror for over 34 years . I just bought 2 new bicycle 's and tried one of the mirrors that strap onto your hand grip . Well if you have a bike that has the twist shiftier on the handle bars you lose some of your hand grip space so you are always hitting the mirror and then well I lost it , feel off some wear . But not this one you would just about have to wreck your bike to lose it . And it is glass not plastic so it is clearer to see with . You can set it high or set it below your handle bars and it sets out enough that it goes past your shoulders to see . But is not a mirror that you can just take on or off . It has to pretty much stay on . The only thing that you may not like is you have to cut of the end of the hand grip to put it on as it goes into the handle bar . But when in place you do not notice the cut out .####[([-1], [81, 87], 'POS'), ([-1], [93], 'POS'), ([-1], [94, 95], 'POS'), ([-1], [99, 102], 'POS'), ([-1], [118, 120], 'POS'), ([-1], [123, 128], 'POS'), ([-1], [145, 150], 'NEU'), ([-1], [189, 194], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors

Great net . This can be used for golf or as a backstop for baseball , etc . I would get the 7x7 instead of the 5x5 as the bigger net is much more versatile if you have the room . I was surprised how much we pull this net out of the garage and use it for all types of sports and activities . The kids love it and so far has held up nicely .

This watch looks great , is light and low profile so it doesn 't catch on objects when working with your hands . The downside is the face is unprotected and scratches something fierce . If you can remember to take it off when working on machinery or anything with limited space you should get many years out of a great looking watch . Otherwise be prepared to check the time through a severly scratched watch face . Functions are adequate for time interval training . The band on these usually breaks after several years of use .

Unless the player is tall or has long arms , the tether is a good length for making sure the ball does not get tossed too high (toss should be about 1 volleyball above where the player will hit it , not several feet in the air which is a common bad habit most learn ) .

I purchased this for my Glock 23 GEN4 and it works great . Love the fact that I don 't have to carry my light anymore . I would have gone with a 5th star but the information about it is a little off . It says "rubberized paddle " but the one I received is not a paddle type nor did it come with a paddle to put on it . Mine came with the belt hook system . I like the way it feels and I carry it in the open as without the paddle I find it hard to conceal . It is adjustable to rotate for comfort and the latching does not apply pressure to the trigger . I installed the "SiderLock " and it stays on safe when in holster . I also installed an extended Mag release which has plenty of room from it to the holster and even with several pulls have not had one hit of it against the holster drawing or replacing . Excellent .####[([10], [11], 'POS'), ([-1], [18, 25], 'POS'), ([37], [41, 43], 'NEG'), ([-1], [56, 59], 'NEG'), ([85], [80, 81], 'POS'), ([-1], [100, 102], 'NEG'), ([-1], [106, 110], 'POS'), ([113], [114, 120], 'POS'), ([-1], [172], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors

You can tell a window break or car door from a pole snapping with a fish on it .

I read that even REI tents don 't always hold up to the rain . But , I always bring a waterproof tarp anyway . We pitch over a sandy beach , so we had to put rocks over each tent stake .

We were warm and toasty because of this small backpacking tent when the nights hit the low 40s , even with the window and door open to prevent condensation buildup . The screens kept out the mosquitoes . We didn 't bring thermals because we ran out of room in our packs . We had 20 degree bags and klymit static v pads . I read reviews about people tripping over the cords , so I tied bright yellow fabric ribbons to the cords .

I bought 2 of these mats to use for a Girl Scout sleep over at the aquarium . The girls were sleeping on hard cement floors an needed some padding . I inflated with a pump ( you need one with a skinny nozzle tip ) and it did take a few minutes to inflate them , but they held air and were comfortable . I would recommend having a separate pillow as this is pretty much just flat . The mat held air all night and was pretty comfy . I think the downside to this mat is the valve . It would be nice if it was bigger (like an air mattress ) . That way it would inflate /deflate much faster . To deflate this mat , you have to pinch to valve to keep it open while also pushing the air out of the mat . Not the easiest and it takes a while . The nice thing about this is that 's it 's smaller and less heavy than a twin mattress (and takes up less space when inflated ) , so it would be easier to carry with you .

This step is well made and very sturdy . It will not fit 35 " tires . I purchased this step to use on a jeep with 35 " tires knowing it might be a little short on the depth side (and it is ) but could be modified to work . If you are not able or willing to make the modifications , do not buy this step . I used 1 " thin wall square tubing I had in my shop to make extensions so there was no added cost for me .

WONDERFUL little stove for camping or canning of garden produce . What we especially like about this stove is the burners . They burn clean and do not produce black soot on the bottom of the pots that are used . This stove has burners that are very similar to a gas stove /oven you would have in your home .

Yes the rail does hang over the receiver a bit if you mount it so 4 screws are used .

Fast shipping and good quality . Perfect product for beginner to professional badminton player . It is durable , stay longer than a normal feather shuttlecock . If you like to save money , this one definitely works for you . UPDATE * * * * * * * * * * My skill got better and i was trying to get a better shuttlecock for some pro play . So i bought mavis 2000 and 350 . However , surprisingly they didn 't work out for me due to the speed was too fast that i cannot really perform 100 % of my skill . EX : easy serving or return will go outside , shuttlecock easily breaking apart when we play very intense smashing game So again , i came back to this mavis 300 which i think it has the closest standard speed like the feather shuttlecock . I play two different locations , one uses plastic shuttlecock and other uses feather shuttle cock , so i am pretty sure that Maxis 300 is about the standard speed which also allows me to perform 100 % of my skill . Plus , the bird isn 't that speedy that will burst and break itself , so it can last longer than 350 & 2000 .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([7], [6], 'POS'), ([-1], [19, 25], 'POS'), ([25], [17], 'POS'), ([25], [19, 25], 'POS'), ([135, 136], [141, 149], 'POS'), ([174, 175], [183, 191], 'POS'), ([196], [197, 206], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors

I know in today 's world of portable electronics and even portable power , it 's easy to just buy a battery or AC powered pump but let me tell you on many camping trips , this thing saved my bacon . It 's the most powerful hand pump I 've ever used . The attachments for connecting to various valve types are permanently fixed to the end of the output tube so you won 't lose them and they are right there for quick changing . So obviously this thing is great when you are camping and the batteries die or you forget your portable pump , but even better , this thing will fill your air mattress faster and firmer . So leave the electronics at home . Another awesome benefit of this pump came when starting campfires . Especially if your wood is damp . Get your fire started and use one of the fine nozzle attachments to blow a jet stream of air directly on the flames /coals and in no time you will have a blaze going . If you are a prepper this is a must have in your bag of tricks . I might buy another .####[([37], [38, 40], 'POS'), ([47, 48], [45, 46], 'POS'), ([55], [81, 85], 'POS'), ([90], [92], 'POS'), ([113], [114, 121], 'POS'), ([132], [131], 'POS'), ([-1], [191, 192], 'POS'), ([-1], [200, 202], 'POS')]####Sports_and_Outdoors
