These run small ! I normally wear size 11M . I own a pair of Saucony Cohesion 7 running shoes that are size 11M and they fit +feel great . I ordered the Excursion TR8 in an 11M but it fit very differently than the other pair though . My toes felt cramped , and after wearing them for a while my feet began to hurt a bit . Fortunately I always wear a new pair of shoes strictly inside the house and on the carpet mostly until I 'm certain that I 'm happy with the way they fit , feel , and look . That way , in case I want to return them , they don 't show any signs of wear . I thought that possibly a size 11 . 5M might fit better , but in this style /color that size was sold out , so I ended up ordering a pair of the very similar Saucony Excursion TR9 from another retailer . Unfortunately even those 11 .5s hurt my feet after a couple hours of wear . I guess I 'll have to stick to the brand I 've been wearing for years (Merrell ) .

I recently ordered Keen Whisper and Venice , both of which have very light arch support . The Whisper is a lot prettier than the Venice , so I returned the Venice and ordered the Newport for the much better arch support . Overall , all 3 models fit very comfortable . The sole of the Newport is the least flexible but provides the best support and cushioning , and you feel like you are wearing regular sneakers . As stated by a couple of reviewers , they are longer and a lot wider ( chunkier ) and better reinforced in the front . I would say these are much better suited for hiking than the other two models .

Pricing hint : I have been watching the price on this style for a couple of months (cart -save for later ) . Amazon changes the price often and the price varies from $ 100 pair to $62 a pair .

OK , In all honesty this is a pretty nice hoodie . Not a heavy weight by any stretch but very nice none the less . The fit was just fine for me . I am an older guy so this was a good fit .

The Rago 21 is quickly becoming my go -to garment for under vintage and vintage -style clothing .

Great shoe . I 've had Nike 's before and have always been pleased with the comfort , performance , and quality . Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first , so I was nervous . But this turned out to be a great choice . Breathable , lightweight but sturdy , and comfortable during all my workouts . The built -in arch support is great and I 've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use . As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes , I would consider these a 'medium ' build (not thin , not overly thick ) so if you 're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration .

Obsessed with these shoes ! I was looking for good all around sneakers (running , walking , tennis , etc . ) and these more than fit the bill . I was looking specifically for black nikes ( I love the fit ) with white soles (good for court sports ) ; I was a little reluctant to purchase because I wasn 't sure whether the black on the soles would contact the ground , but it doesn 't !####[([3], [0], 'POS'), ([12], [26, 28], 'POS')]####AMAZON_FASHION

Super light -weight , decent arch support (mine is higher than average ) . I was pleasantly surprised by the sole / tread on these for my circuit training classes , as I couldn 't really tell by online pics . Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15 +years ago - I always wore one to 1 . 5 sizes larger in their "Hurache 's " /running shoes , so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic , heel , boot ) . But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less , I don 't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging , jumping , etc . ) . Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe , but no damage to box , paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further . I am very happy and highly recommend , although I have only worked out it once !####[([-1], [0, 2], 'POS'), ([-1], [4, 6], 'POS'), ([20], [16, 18], 'POS'), ([22], [16, 18], 'POS'), ([-1], [42, 44], 'POS'), ([-1], [122, 123], 'POS'), ([102], [94, 99], 'POS'), ([172, 173], [163, 170], 'NEG'), ([179], [176, 177], 'POS'), ([-1], [197, 201], 'POS'), ([195], [187, 193], 'POS'), ([-1], [205, 206], 'POS'), ([-1], [208, 209], 'POS')]####AMAZON_FASHION

I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient . After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair . They are slightly longer in look then I would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers . Also , the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you 're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this ) .

These sticks are great for training , but not as good as they could be . The issue is the PVC pipe they use as a core . It should be stronger . Several times we had to replace the core with PVC tubing we got at the local hardware store . I found that if you take the gray PVC pipes used for watering systems , you will have a much more useful stick . With that , you can hit as hard as you want and not break the sticks , and you can do disarming , as well as stick assisted control holds . With the core it comes with , the tube bends , and breaks with any real force is placed on the stick . If you are tapping lightly , and not doing disarming , then these are perfect .

The black one looked fine . The natural colored one had cracks on both ends . Some as wide as 1 / 4 inch . Both bokens were wrapped in hard plastic .

It was the cheapest and came up when I searched for a swimming mess bag . The handles are what you pull to close the top - not a drawstring . They don 't allow the top to cinch closed all the way , and they are slightly short . I find it awkward to put on my back or even over 1 shoulder . And even if I did , it still wouldn 't close all the way and my stuff would fall out . Or I would always be conscious of the fact that is could fall out . . . which isn 't any more convenient that just carrying my fins and paddles on top of my kick board right ? I 've decided I don 't swim enough to pursue an exchange . I 've taken to closing the top as much as possible and grabbing the top with one hand . Not too bad , but I recommend paying the extra 5 bucks for a TYR or speedo brand if you are in the market . Also if you are buying for kids , they will probably loose a paddle or goggles with this particular bag .####[([12, 14], [3], 'NEU'), ([-1], [47, 48], 'NEG'), ([-1], [156, 158], 'NEU')]####Sports_and_Outdoors

The top part where it sits on the crown of your head is camoflauge patterned . Sort of a dark multicam pattern . The mesh material itself isn 't very fine .

This lantern works perfect for a small group ( 3 -5 ) of people to hang around . Also , works well on a standard sized picnic table . If you have a larger group (or several tables ) you will need more lighting . I bought this mostly for camping , also for emergency preparedness . It is recommended you have several light sources (flashlights and lanterns ) . This is perfect size and output for an average living room . With the bulb , I feel like it is safer than the propane or gas lanterns . Also , the rated run time on this 4D -battery version is better the the larger 8D version of this .

I 'm not using this step for aerobics or anything high -intensity , but for rehab on my knee . I needed a step I could adjust from about 4 " (where my knee is now ) up to 12 " or so for when it 's feeling better . This step fits the bill and isn 't as big as the standard aerobics steps out there , so easier to hide away when I 'm not using it . It 's stable enough for my low -intensity work , but I probably wouldn 't try jumping on it or anything . The risers don 't lock in very securely , and because of the shape (vs longer steps ) , I 'd be worried it would come apart .
