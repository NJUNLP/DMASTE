A kilo of tasty rough brown sugar cubes with the slightest taste of molasses , made from cane sugar in Mauritius . Great in tea . They take a minute to dissolve but it 's worth the wait . Some people brew the tea with the sugar in the teapot . I don 't mind stirring it in the cup until I can 't hear the crunchy crystals anymore . . I can 't get this anywhere within a hundred miles so the slightly high price for Prime shipping was worth it . The only sugar I want to put in my tea .

I moved from Twinings Earl Grey tea to the Darjeeling flavor just to try something different . Not totally a great idea . Don 't get me wrong , it is my opinion that Twinings offers the best tea world wide . The switch from their Earl Grey , (which is floral smelling and leaves you with a WOW now that is a tea drinkers tea kind of flavor ) , was not my best tea decision . Darjeeling smells like lawn grass in comparison and although I got used to it and liked it after a few batches , it does not compare with Earl Grey 's flavor . I switched back to Earl Grey . If you are a fan of Darjeeling , Twinings makes it worth drinking .####[([-1], [17, 21], 'NEG'), ([79], [81, 82], 'NEG'), ([78], [93], 'POS'), ([78], [101, 103], 'NEG')]####Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

I was on the sugar free energy drink kick for the longest time . . . I knew sucralose ( Splenda ) was causing me problems as any artificial sugar will do over time . So I searched and searched and this is the only energy drink that uses Stevia instead of artificial sugar as a sweetener . The taste isn 't that bad and I drink them at room temperature . People used to sugary drinks (which I can 't stand at all ) probable won 't like the taste . But if you are use to diet drinks and can learn to like different taste this drink would be the healthy energy drink to switch too . I just wished they made Guru energy shots .

This tea is not quite as bold as the Yorkshire Gold . It has a more mellow flavor and is delightful . I usually drink 2 cups of the Yorkshire Gold each morning and then brew a cup of this . It 's a nice follow -up after having the Yorkshire Gold . I do allow it to brew for 5 minutes , and it delivers a lovely cup of tea .
