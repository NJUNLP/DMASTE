I didn 't know Kubaba was a Sumarian Queen : Kubaba is the only queen on the Sumerian King List , which states she reigned for 100 years roughly in the Early Dynastic III period (ca . 2500 - 2330 BC ) of Sumerian history .

I 've had Designer Whey 's premade liquid vanilla protein drink in a carton , and figured this would taste the same once I added water . Sadly , I was wrong . I tend to blend these with fruit and bring them to work . 30 minutes after blending I end up with a bizarre froth at the top of my glass , which is less than appetizing , and the overall flavor seems to have a sort of odd lightly salty /chemical aftertaste . I realize it 's a protein powder , but based on my experience with their other products , I was surprised . Overall , they still get a 3 because protein isn 't supposed to be a delicious milkshake - it is what it is .

Ive loved these since i was a little kid . I grew up eating them with espresso at like 8 years old ( i guess i had an advanced pallate at sn early age lol ) id been meaning to buy these for a while snd saw them on here so i had to get them . The only thing that disappointed me was im pretty sure these used to include the square cookies with rainbow sprinkles which i didn 't see in this package . Besides that they were fresh and yummy with just the right amount of sweetness and lighter than a sugar cookie and less frosted . . .just as i remember . . .and still awesome with espresso . i added some dark and white chocolate covered cherries to the cookie plate as well which was really yummy together - everyone loved the combo . The only question im left with still is "where have all the rainbow sprinkle cookies gone ?

Just back from a trip to Japan , hungry for some good nabeyaki udon , I ordered this stock . There 's got to be something better on the market . I love salt , and dashi should be salty , but not overwhelmingly so . And why sugar , let alone two or three types of sugar ? While I don 't have a problem with MSG myself , I do try to avoid it . Probably my own fault ; I should have specified "No MSG " , except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn 't be labelled somewhere ! Outside of any of this , the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base . I know if I want all of that , I need to make it from scratch , but since purchasing this I 've tried several non - MSG brands and all of them are better . Sad to say , because Ajinomoto is a venerable company , but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other , healthier brands !####[([36], [37, 44], 'NEG'), ([98], [101, 107], 'NEG'), ([117], [118, 124], 'NEG')]####Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

As an avid tea drinker I find myself blessed with a wonderful variety of different blends stocked in my cupboard but most days I find myself reaching past them for this one . No , it 's not the most exotic or the most expensive or the fanciest blend but maybe that is what makes it my go to tea , it 's simple smooth rich flavor and warm aroma that is pleasing to the senses , does not overwhelm the palate or leave you with an unpleasant aftertaste .####[([59], [56, 58], 'POS'), ([66], [63], 'POS'), ([66], [64], 'POS'), ([66], [65], 'POS'), ([68, 69], [72, 75], 'POS'), ([-1], [77, 81], 'POS')]####Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

I just received this set , after ordering it for a great price of $ 12 .50 . For that price I am very pleased with it . The little glass teapot works fine . The handle stayed cool enough and you have to hold the lid down , but if you use the little "ball " on the lid to hold it down , it isn 't too hot and you won 't burn yourself . I brew the tea and then my husband and I each have a middle -eastern style tea glass full and then I brew the next pot using the same flower . If you use a big mug , it would only make one cup , but this works for us . The first tea I used opened up and looked very pretty , the tea was mild in flavor and tasty . I am looking forward to trying the next tea . The bamboo box will be useful for storage of tea -bags etc . Overall I love this for the price I got it at . If I had paid full price , I would have been a little disappointed . . .####[([12], [11], 'POS'), ([-1], [23, 25], 'POS'), ([29, 31], [32, 33], 'POS'), ([36], [37, 39], 'NEU'), ([54, 59], [66, 75], 'POS'), ([129, 130], [136, 138], 'POS'), ([141], [143, 145], 'NEU'), ([141], [147], 'POS'), ([156, 157], [151, 154], 'POS'), ([-1], [174], 'POS')]####Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

As a meat alternative which also does not contain soy , seitan has become popular , and I bought it willingly until I purchased this gluten flour and started making my own .

I purchase a bag of these every few months for making boba , bubble tea at home and it never disappoints . The actual product did change to this from the original that I used to receive and it was a change for the better . The consistency of these tapiocas is better and there is less powder in the bag . To cook : Make sure that you have a pan of water at a rolling boil before adding in the tapioca or it will turn into a gooey mess Add desired amount of tapioca (you want to have about 2 times or more of water because you will boil the entire time ) Set timer for 5 minutes and stir at a rolling boil . Once the consistency of the water starts to thicken your tapioca should be cooked thoroughly , this could be a bit less than 5 minutes depending on your stove top . If you have any remaining tapioca , you can store in water (and honey or agave to sweeten ) in the fridge for about 3 days before they start to get a bit hard , to make extra and use later .####[([-1], [19, 20], 'POS'), ([24], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([50], [52], 'POS'), ([-1], [56, 57], 'POS'), ([-1], [41, 44], 'POS')]####Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

Coconut oil is great for many things ! I use it in place of butter and oils in recipes . You can even use this on your skin , as well as to clean your mouth by rinsing with it .

This adds a nice shine but is not very pigmented like the gold luster dust is . I had to start with a very dark gray fondant to get it to actually look silver .

I definitely recommend this tea due to its quality of manufacture and specifically the taste . The tastes of pomegranate , raspberry , and strawberry mix very well with green tea . I wasn 't sure about that flavor combination at first , but was pleasantly surprised during my first cup . I have always been a fan of Twinings tea and its quality . This tea mixes well with honey , and specifically buckwheat honey if you have a cough or sore throat . I am a regular tea drinker and have found a new favorite . The packaging of this tea was quite good . The 6 boxes came in a large white box in which they were packed tight for protection , and individually wrapped . I am sure I will be buying this item again . . .####[([4], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([4], [8, 10], 'POS'), ([4], [12, 14], 'POS'), ([25], [26, 27], 'POS'), ([38, 39], [45, 46], 'POS'), ([59], [53, 58], 'POS'), ([66], [67, 70], 'POS'), ([-1], [92, 96], 'POS'), ([99], [104, 105], 'POS'), ([120], [121, 123], 'POS'), ([109], [126, 127], 'POS'), ([137], [131, 135], 'POS'), ([63], [53, 57], 'POS')]####Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

Buy this honey ! You won 't be disappointed . I like the fact that it is 100 % certified organic true raw state unpasteurized and unfiltered , has a great company write -up on the label , comes in a glass jar and not a plastic jar , and it really has a wonderful smooth texture and mellow full distinct flavor , unlike other creamed honeys I have purchased in the past . My cappuccino tastes so much better with this particular honey . The price is so affordable and much much cheaper than if I had to purchase this in a health food store .

I ALMOST HATE TO SAY THIS . THE ORIGINAL ONLINE AD USED THE WORDS XYLITOL ' POWDER ' .

NOT LIKELY THAT Y OU 'D SPRINKLE GRANULATED SUGAR ON THE OUTSIDE OF A CAKE , FOR EXAMPLE . YOU 'D NEED POWDERED .
