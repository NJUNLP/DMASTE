I 'll be uncharacteristically brief : this was the best Anita Blake book since "Burnt Offerings " - the return of Edward (and yes , Olaf as well ) was worth the wait and I savored every little detail . I especially , surprisingly , enjoyed the scene between Raoul and Anita . I have one tiny little nit to pick : When Sylvie visits Anita in the hospital and says she doesn 't do women . I think that line may have been intended for Claudia because I have always cherished Sylvie as the sole preternatural lesbian in Anita 's world . Or maybe she should have said she knew Anita didn 't do women .####[([10, 12], [9], 'POS'), ([-1], [30, 32], 'POS'), ([38], [35, 37], 'POS'), ([47, 51], [45], 'POS')]####Books

The story flows well through the book , with enough detail for the reader to appreciate the difference between our society and that which was in existence during the time of the story , but does not bog down on trivia . The characters are not superheroes or dolts , but are complex enough where you can be engrossed with them . The wording and grammar are not at a kindergarten level , but the author has not made it so complex that it is hard to read or to require the presence of a dictionary .

This is a fine book for adults and teens alike as it gives an honest description of the actions , feelings and relationships of a young soldier fighting in 1967 VietNam . Without belaboring the point , the author successfully showed complex and long lasting changes that result from this miserable experience . The struggle to remain human and compassionate in a situation that called for detachment , depersonalization and the blunting of feelings was clear . The Viet Nam era was for me , an extremely formative event and it is unfortunate that we have remembered so few of its many lessons . In 1968 "Stars and Sripes " wrote sanitized and erroneous reports of combat , including inflated body counts and the empty hope that the Paris Peace Talks would bring an end to the conflict ~ how similar to the situation out of Iraq today . "They never talk about the cost " is Richie 's observation . Will we EVER have the courage to be truthful about the cost of war , present and into the future ?####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([15], [14], 'POS'), ([41, 45], [39, 40], 'POS'), ([88], [86, 87], 'POS')]####Books

A reprint of Pope 's novel first published in 1965 . The action is concentrated in a very short time period (less than two weeks ) in the later part of 1796 , just before the British evacuation of Corsica . Ramage escapes from a sinking frigate , aids the escape of Italian refugees from the French , and then deals with the aftermath of his actions . There is a final side action on the coast of Corsica involving the grounded frigate Belette ( W .P . Gosset , "the Lost Ships of the Royal Navy , 1793 -1900 , " lists the frigate Belette as "burned at Ajaccio as unserviceable " on 20 October 1796 , along with the frigate Poulette ) . The action is , perhaps , a little too fast paced . At points , the author gets wrapped up in details of ship handling , but overall it is a good story with a somewhat romantic ending .####[([126], [131, 135], 'NEG'), ([141], [142, 146], 'NEG'), ([157], [156], 'POS'), ([162], [160, 161], 'POS')]####Books

Even though the story remains relevant and can hold true in terms of glossing over how current race relations are conveyed , it is still interesting to note that the story serves more as a cautionary tale towards misogyny , even though women 's faults and shortcomings are outlined . The emphasis is more on a woman preserving her honour and her virtue than it is about a fair game of sport over who gets what . Race was dealt with competitively to win a woman 's loyalties and affections . And the story shows the consequences of what happens when the game is rigged and there isn 't a fair fight , to dissolve tensions . Had the characters been less temperamental and perhaps more seasoned in the game of love , they might have faired well . It helps to watch unfolding events at a distance so as to not get emotionally caught up in the outcome and to derive the most reward from the lessons .####[([3], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([3], [7, 9], 'POS'), ([143, 144], [140, 142], 'POS')]####Books

When considering the Tawny Man series as a whole , it is an excellent conclusion to the story begun in the Farseer trilogy . However , the Farseer trilogy was the better written half of the story . The Tawny Man series suffers from a lot of laborious reminiscing and build -up . The pacing of each book is not the best , and you 'll find large stretches where the story plods and you find yourself wishing you could skip ahead to the end . The strength of the Tawny Man story is that it finishes the story of characters you have come to know and love .

I don 't have much to add to the positive reviews here ; the Russians have once again proven themselves to be great writers . The book is so short it left me wishing (longing ) that it was a lot longer and included more cases . The writing and the tone reminded me a little of the books by James Herriot . There are some striking similarities . Both men were newly qualified and were worried about making a good impression on the population they were about to work with . Both have a keen observation of the human condition and both worked in the days before antibiotics . I had to smile every time Bulgakov frets that he 'll have to treat a strangulated hernia . You feel for him , But Herriot had Sigfried Farnon , a boss who knew his stuff and with whom he could consult when he need to . Bulgakov had nobody to mentor him and so there are disturbing examples of malpractice . The story about morphine may be of interest to those who 've had addiction but I wondered why it was included at all . It doesn 't have the same feel as the rest of the stories and seems tacked on .

The best nautical historical fiction for the late eighteenth , early nineteenth century British navy there is , hands down . O ' Brian researched exhaustively to produce this series , and the accuracy is spot on . More to the point , they 're infinitely readable , with laudable chracter development and environmental description that puts you firmly in the midst of what you 're reading . There is such a wealth of description , you 'll want a dictionary , thesaurus , and an atlas at hand when you dive in .

for about 50 years , but I have never read much of anything about the lives of European generals during WWII . This book was very very interesting . I talks about generals when they are not in the office . George S . Patton , Mark Clark , and others . It also talks about George Marshall , President Roosevelt , President Truman , Churchill . Fascinating . I think Kay Summersby really knew General Eisenhower more than anyone else in his life . So many interesting events , personalities , things that happened to her . Some comments on Amazon state that they do not believe that she actually lived all that is in the book , but I can not agree . I am astounded at what she saw and the people that she met . This book shows the shortness of life . So many experiences in life . So many unfulfilled dreams and hopes - - yet so many unexpected joys and much happiness too . I am so glad that she wrote about this side of these people , other wise we might not know them as well .####[([23], [25, 27], 'POS'), ([88], [85, 87], 'POS'), ([90], [85, 87], 'POS'), ([92, 94], [85, 87], 'POS'), ([129, 137], [126, 127], 'POS'), ([140], [141, 145], 'POS')]####Books

Quite good read as an early offering from a very capable writer and storyteller . The prologue presents a seemingly unrelated intro to a very different storyline that jerks the readers emotions and notions about the characters like wild roller coaster ride . Murder and mayhem seem to be constant companions in a deceptive plot to reach a well hidden objective .

The first three books were great . The fourth one was lacking and I had hoped that this fifth one would redeem the fourth book by being as good as the first three - it did not . Describing things , places , men that have been described by the author before a hundred times - gets old . The descriptions take me nowhere that I haven 't already been or want to go . Entire chapters about people that I don 't care about , or that I didn 't come to like as well as the characters who 've been conveniently killed so things will become a little more simple , these chapters pretty much are worth skipping or browsing - looking for quotation marks and key words that may have something to do with someone who is interesting . Anyway , if there are going to be seven of these books , I guess that I can wait five years for the next one and I 'll probably buy it and read it .

I made the mistake of purchasing this printing of C . S . Lewis ' book without checking reviews . Although the book written by C .S . Lewis is a good one , I would encourage buyers of this book to purchase one from a different publisher . This edition was very difficult to read , because it has many , many typographical errors , uses very small font size that is hard to read , and on every page , substitutes parts of words with symbols or the wrong letters , and occasionally leaves out words altogether .

This review refers to the Harper Collins ( UK ) so -called deluxe edition . While it is of finer quality than the trade hardcover , it is rather plain . The book comes in a fairly sturdy slipcase , the binding is tight and the paper is above average quality . However , the book is made entirely of paper ; no cloth , no bukram , no leather , not even faux or bonded leather . The boards are bound in satin finish paper , the spine ; also paper , with a faux graining to it . The slipcase has a decorative circular window in it . The problem is that the window looks very crudely cut making the otherwise elegant slipcase look cheap . All in all not much value here from a book collector 's point of view . There are other , less expensive , more beautiful collector editions of the Hobbit . Nevertheless , for the Tolkien fanatic this is a must -have . And for that alone I give it 4 stars .####[([20], [19], 'POS'), ([-1], [28, 29], 'NEG'), ([38], [36, 37], 'POS'), ([41], [43], 'POS'), ([46], [48, 50], 'POS'), ([57], [58, 60], 'NEG'), ([-1], [62, 63], 'NEG'), ([79], [81, 85], 'NEG'), ([88], [95, 97], 'NEG'), ([91], [95, 96], 'NEG'), ([101], [104, 106], 'POS'), ([115], [116, 119], 'NEG'), ([125], [126], 'NEG'), ([-1], [131, 134], 'NEG'), ([-1], [167, 169], 'POS'), ([-1], [178, 179], 'POS')]####Books

This is the first of the Ed Eagle series . Funny , though , how the main character is the victim /suspect ( Wolf Willett ) and not Eagle , who is the character 's attorney . I was a little confused on this approach . Wolf is a movies producer and gets caught up in a quadruple murder . He has an alibi for one , but not the other three . To make matters worse , was he drugged ? Did he have an alcohol blackout ? His wife , his friend , and a man he knew by another name have been brutally murdered in his home , and maybe while he was present , or maybe not . An excon sister figures in the mess somehow , and Ed Eagle is on the case . The descriptions of Santa Fe are very well done . And made me wish I lived there . I could almost smell the pinon . I 'm not totally engrossed with any of the characters , they are rather shallow , and the writing reminds me of some other authors that were successful crime writers in another era .

I devoured this book when I first read it early in college . The present popularity of Tolkien 's adventures of Bilbo Baggins prompted me to read it again . I have read The Silmarillion and the trilogy of the ring , and I will explore more of Tolkien 's writings .####[([27], [26], 'POS'), ([32], [29], 'NEU'), ([36], [34, 35], 'POS'), ([41], [39], 'POS'), ([32], [31], 'POS')]####Books

Alistair Maclean is an amazing writer and this book is one of his best . I first read it in the early 1960 's , it was amazing then and amazing now . I think he is not a well know writer in the USA . A few of his books have been made into movies ( The Guns of Navarone , Where Eagles Dare and Breakheart Pass ) . Even today , his books combine plot and excellent writing to keep you guessing until the end . I think this is one of his best . One thing that is notable is his writing style , always descriptive without becoming intrusive and contrived . I am unashamedly hooked and recommend him to anyone who enjoys an thriller .####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([8], [10, 13], 'POS'), ([-1], [27], 'POS'), ([79], [78], 'POS'), ([104, 105], [108, 111], 'POS'), ([-1], [117, 118], 'POS'), ([-1], [120], 'POS')]####Books
For the most part , this book is an excellent read . The characters are well developed and details about them as well as life in Leningrad at the beginning of WWII are so dynamic that readers would be drawn into the story . There are many parts of this book that are very intense and often difficult to read because of the severe living conditions the characters have to endure . A good portion of the book , though , drags on and on with detailed descriptions of the characters ' sexual exploits which just got old after a while . I found I had to really "work " to get through this section of the book . While the intensity of their passion and sexual attraction is warranted for plot purposes , I thought it got to just be too much and became more of a "yawn " . Depending on your taste , it might be worth skipping through . The detail and suspense in most of the book is very good though and well worth the read .####[([6], [9, 10], 'POS'), ([13], [15, 16], 'POS'), ([171], [177, 180], 'POS'), ([164], [173, 174], 'POS'), ([166], [173, 174], 'POS'), ([47], [53, 54], 'NEG'), ([47], [57, 59], 'NEG'), ([74, 77], [73], 'POS'), ([74, 77], [81, 82], 'NEG'), ([114, 117], [105, 112], 'NEG')]####Books

Finally took the plunge and read Master and Commander , the first novel in the series . Have been recommended these novels many times over the years . Took quite a while to find my "sea legs " with this one , but I loved the battle scenes and the relationship between Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin . Rich in historical detail which I enjoyed but had to stop many times to search out some of the nautical wording in the novel which tended to play havoc with the flow of the story . A tough life on the high seas in those bygone days . . . . . . .####[([21], [17, 19], 'POS'), ([46, 47], [44], 'POS'), ([50, 56], [44], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [58], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [64], 'POS'), ([77, 78], [66, 73], 'NEG'), ([92], [83, 90], 'NEG')]####Books
" Dracula " is a phenomenal story with terrific atmosphere . Although we 're largely inured to the vampire mythos (if anything , we 're possibly sick of it from overexposure ) , I can definitely see how Stoker 's novel would have been pants -crappingly terrifying to readers of his day . The pacing is great , plot twists are dramatic and chaotic , and the battle of wits with Count Dracula is legendary .

To me , this almost reads like a 252 -page suicide note . . . certainly it deals with feelings of self -loathing and his decision to commit his third wife for psychiatric treatment and drug therapy . It 's not happy , but as usual it 's incredibly vivid and incredibly imaginative . If you choose to go with the central conceit (a drug which transports users through time and into alternate realities ) , it 's an extremely wild ride .

( I mean Socialists , not , as some think are the same thing , Communists . ) Pride and Prejudice for people who like to think , and are socially interested . A great view of the difference in the rich and the poor social levels in the 1800 's , it truly makes the reader glad someone took the labour fights and fight for women 's rights , so we can enjoy the freedom we have today . I liked the characters , they seem to me like real persons with whom one can identify in a lesser or greater degree . They adapt in a natural way , through philosophy and events .

What a great story ! Aubrey is in trouble by land and sea because of bad decisions and yet brilliant at sea when it comes to sailoring and battle tactics where O ' Brian has never swayed with regard to the captain . Aubrey is endeared to me as a reader because he 's brilliant , doesn 't know it or dwell on it , in his element . He is the polar opposite of brilliant in personal matters , knows it and dwells on it . What a great balance in story telling because I , as a reader , worry about Aubrey every moment one foot is ashore and I 'm concerned for him at sea but feel that every sea encounter will end as well as it can which doesn 't mean with success . This is another great installment by O 'Brian and I highly recommend it .####[([3], [2], 'POS'), ([43], [45, 54], 'POS'), ([92, 93], [89, 90], 'POS'), ([-1], [140, 145], 'POS'), ([-1], [148, 149], 'POS')]####Books

Thomas L . Friedman has produced a readable but not superficial work which helps its readers grasp the complicated world we now inhabit . He has a gift for creating analogies which make clear extremely unclear concepts . His " Five Gas Stations " , for example , is the best explanation for the many different cultural /economic systems now extant that I 've come across . The book was written well before 9 - 11 but has some chilling predictions and discussions about the potential for such actions and their consequences . For this uncertain and frightening world , Friedman offers insights , warnings , and reassurances .####[([11], [7], 'POS'), ([11], [9, 10], 'POS'), ([40, 42], [50, 58], 'POS'), ([68], [77, 82], 'POS'), ([100], [101, 107], 'POS')]####Books

This is one of my top ten classic reading choices , and it pairs well with a reading of George Orwell 's 1984 . Huxley shows us a world where entertainment has become the center and everyone just wants to have a good time . He conveys tragedy in his story , and provides some scientific detail to ground the story in believability without being cumbersome . I recommend this as a dystopian classic , and I also recommend reading it with Entertaining Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman , as Postman applies the concepts in the book to a critique of the real world .####[([-1], [5, 9], 'POS'), ([-1], [13, 22], 'POS'), ([-1], [46, 47], 'POS'), ([-1], [53, 56], 'POS'), ([-1], [68], 'POS')]####Books

I was extremely disappointed by this book . Instead of providing a thoughtful explanation of Christianity , the author dishes out his trite biases against women , gays and others .

The novel is ok but there is a lot of clichs ; the turn of "evil " guy behind it all suddenly developing a conscience seems a little too forced , just for the sake of the argument , as well as the keys figures that were the real power behind the evil bloodline are just flat characters , without any personality of their own . I found the computer nerd technology too much of hocus -pocus , the eternal ones an unsolved /unexplaind mystery , and the G -man a bit superman in excess . The reference to the Templars seems just a clich .

I have read the first three of the Ramage novels and I find the books to be excellent . The stories are well written and enjoyable . Pope is obviously well versed in his subject and conveys that knowledge well . In my view , the Ramage stories are on a par with the Hornblower and the Bolitho series , in fact I personally find Pope 's books to be more entertaining than the Bolitho series of Alexander Kent . I did enjoy Kent 's stories , but I like Pope 's stories even better . . .fully equal to the Hornblower series . I think Pope has done an excellent job and I look forward to reading the rest of the series .####[([14], [17], 'POS'), ([20], [22, 23], 'POS'), ([20], [25], 'POS'), ([27], [29, 31], 'POS'), ([27], [36, 39], 'POS'), ([65, 67], [70, 71], 'POS'), ([90, 92], [89], 'POS'), ([106], [108, 111], 'POS'), ([122], [114, 119], 'POS')]####Books
I have read The Hobbit and the trilogy ( Lord of the Rings ) on my kindle and love the story . I have also promised myself that as much as I love my kindle and the savings it gives me when buying books I would also buy the books I love in hard copy . This is mainly because I still love the feel of holding a book and looking through it . I would hate to see actual books go by the wayside and only have digital books . The Hobbit is a very nice book and I would recommend it to any that loves J .R .R . Tolkien .####[([4], [18], 'POS'), ([7], [18], 'POS'), ([20], [18], 'POS'), ([92], [95, 96], 'POS'), ([-1], [99, 101], 'POS')]####Books

I 've reread this trilogy every few years since my first reading in fifth grade , so probably ten plus read throughs .

I remember reading the thief of always first when I was in middle school . It had enthralled me at the time with it 's fantasy elements of a realm where kids could get whatever they wanted , at an unknown yet horrible cost . Reading it again as a young adult I must say , it still holds it 's own . It might seem a bit rushed in parts but it 's still excellent . The storyline is unique , the characters are interesting , quirky or creepy , and the climax is especially intriguing . It also makes one thinks : If you could have anything you wanted but at personal cost , would you take it ? Or would you enjoy the new life so much you 'd not care ? Clive Barker is one of the masters of unique , odd , or interesting stories and novels , and the thief of always is no exception to this . I highly recommend it for people of all ages .####[([-1], [16, 18], 'POS'), ([-1], [64, 70], 'NEG'), ([-1], [74, 75], 'POS'), ([78], [80], 'POS'), ([83], [85], 'POS'), ([83], [87], 'NEU'), ([83], [89], 'NEG'), ([93], [95, 96], 'POS'), ([155, 157], [159, 160], 'POS'), ([-1], [165, 166], 'POS')]####Books

Some may be offended by my characterization of LoTR as a "minor classic " , but offence do I not mean at all . Indeed , Tolkien stands among the greats of 20th century literature . Nonetheless , the impact of Tolkien 's work does not match the profound significance of Shakespeare or Chaucer or (certainly not ) the King James Bible . This is not to diminish the greatness of Tolkien 's achievements , but rather to acknowledge the sublimity of these sources . I do not think that Tolkien himself would be offended . From all accounts , he was a very humble man . What would he think about all this fuss we make over his work ? Generation after generation , new readers discover the heretofore unexplored lands of Middle - Earth . Long may they live , and deeply may they read !####[([26], [27, 34], 'POS')]####Books
