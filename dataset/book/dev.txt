I 'm a wrestling fan , but more importantly , I 'm a Mick Foley fan . Mr . Foley 's exploits and adventures over the course of his eventful career made a sixteen hour flight to Asia fly by . Having said that , I 'm also a fan of well -written books , and this is , unfortunately , not one of them . It 's clear that the book may have benefitted from the work of a ghost -writer , but at the same time , an autobiography from a man an straightforward as Mr . Foley would have seemed disingenuous with one . In short , this book is an open and honest look at the business of wrestling (although Mr . Foley skirts the issue of genuine heat between Owen Hart and Steve Austin ) , that is at times rambling , but nonetheless extremely enjoyable .####[([71], [72, 81], 'NEG'), ([111], [114], 'NEU'), ([111], [116], 'NEU'), ([-1], [143, 145], 'NEG'), ([-1], [148, 150], 'POS')]####Books
First Sigma Force read for me . Bought it originally due to presence of CAPT Tucker Wayne and his war dog partner , Kane . Was delighted to see the inclusion of a short story , "Tracker " at the end and read that first as an appetizer . Then on to the main course ! Began the .story and wanted to try to finish in one seating . Size of book and other considerations kept me from doing that but I kept the story in mind as I laid the book down , each time leaving one or another of the multiple protagonists in dire straits . The action is fast -paced and without much letup . The prologue of the book gives a subtle hint of the main secret of the story which does not become clear until the end of the book . After the the prologue , Rollins introduces a teaser which stays in the mind of the reader as he /she follows the ensuing maze of excitement . There are some very rough descriptions as the author juxtaposes ethics /morality against the singleminedness of the scientific search for knowledge . I was both horrified and facinated at the science of trying to extend human life toward immortality . As is often the case , the ultimate goal is control of power by the chosen few . A darn good read and only the first of many Sigma Force novels I plan to inhale .####[([36, 37], [26, 28], 'POS'), ([109], [111, 112], 'POS'), ([109], [114, 116], 'POS'), ([178], [176, 177], 'NEU'), ([-1], [197, 200], 'NEU'), ([234], [232, 233], 'POS')]####Books

I have read all 5 books in this series and am really looking forward to the release of the sixth book . I have thoroughly enjoyed them all . If the series was written at a "PG13 " level instead of an "R " level , I would have given it five stars . I would not be comfortable sharing this with anyone under 17 or 18 years old , which is unfortunate because it is such an engrossing storyline . It is easy to see why this is a best selling series . If you aren 't concerned with the "R " level writing , you will probably consider this a 5 -star book series .

This is the first C . S . Lewis book that I 've read . I felt some trepidation in ordering the book , because of the subject , and the intellect of the author . However , I found myself spellbound , enjoying his writing skill , and his humor . At the end of each chapter I found myself delightedly saying aloud - Amen ! This book plainly illustrates to man his condition without God . To those who are "little Christs " as C .S .Lewis calls them , one gratefully realizes that all the good found in us and all the work done by or through us , was in fact His ordered plan as He stands alongside us enabling us . He is both witty and wise - a great read .####[([-1], [39, 41], 'POS'), ([45, 46], [43], 'POS'), ([50], [43], 'POS'), ([-1], [129], 'POS'), ([-1], [131], 'POS'), ([-1], [134, 135], 'POS'), ([68], [69, 76], 'POS')]####Books

I read and taught And Then There Were None , which I thought was an amazing book . I was hoping for a similar experience with Murder on the Orient Express , and I wanted to read it before the film was released . Unfortunately , I was pretty disappointed . There is very little action in this book , and it is mostly Poirot just talking to everyone who is a suspect . I did enjoy the resolution , but getting to that point seemed slow and painful at times . As far as audiobooks go , that could have been one of my issues with enjoying this book . I listened to the book on 1x , and there were still times when the voice actor was difficult to understand . I appreciate how he used a variety of different voices , but there were times when I couldn 't understand him because he used too thick of an accent or spoke too quickly . There are a lot of characters and information to maintain , and maybe reading the book would have been better than listening to it . At least the audiobook is only about six hours , so at least it 's a quick listen !####[([-1], [48, 49], 'NEG'), ([55], [53, 54], 'NEG'), ([78], [75, 76], 'POS'), ([81, 84], [85, 86], 'NEG'), ([81, 84], [88, 90], 'NEG'), ([126], [129, 131], 'NEG'), ([142], [137, 139], 'POS'), ([-1], [150, 152], 'NEG'), ([161], [157, 158], 'NEG'), ([-1], [163, 165], 'NEG')]####Books

Some absolutely brilliant pieces of writing .

The last time I read the Secret Garden was probably in grade school and I honestly don 't remember anything about the book . I 've gotten into classics lately so decided to read it again . I thoroughly enjoyed this book . As an adult , this book had a lot more depth and meaning that it would for an adolescent . The writer painted a beautiful picture where you can visualize the scene as it unfolded . The story of wonder and triumph was uplifting and engaging . I would definitely recommend this book to a reader of any age . It 's an uplifting story that will put you in a good mood and is a great story of growth and hope !####[([41], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([48], [49, 55], 'POS'), ([64], [65, 68], 'POS'), ([80, 84], [86], 'POS'), ([80, 84], [88], 'POS'), ([95], [91, 93], 'POS'), ([107], [106], 'POS'), ([-1], [109, 115], 'POS'), ([120, 124], [119], 'POS')]####Books

I found this version of The Tempest very helpful as it allows readers to enjoy both the Shakespearean text and a modern translation at the same time .

I have read other Richard Bach 's Books ( A bridge across forever ) and he is one of my favorite writers , but this book , which is about being your own person despite what the others may say , just was not working for me .

This is a pretty classic murder mystery novel . Murder happens , evidence is reviewed , people are interviewed , and the detective solves . The writing was generally easy to follow and the ending was certainly interesting ! I won 't include any spoilers , but it wasn 't how I thought it would end . I love a good twist ! It 's actually the first true murder mystery novel I 've read , so I was pretty pleased . That said , I do wish I could have been able to solve the mystery on my own . In order to do that , it seems I would have had to know some facts that were impossible for me to know (because it 's based around another fictional story , which we only receive little information on ) .

Ranking books of this nature is an interesting proposition . First of all it depends while you are here looking at the book , if you need it as a textbook for a course and are looking for a bargain price it is a no brainer - just order it . If you are supplementing other books and you are in the field I think it is also a wise choice as it is very detailed , had great diagrams and is easy to follow . If you are a not a molecular biologist , like me , and are simply keen to learn I think it is a brilliant book on the topic - understanding that this is not my specialty . I can imagine this does not solve all issues in the field , nor could any book , so I would not hesitate for one second in ordering this .

Capra 's exploration of the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism is a book I should have read years ago . I am familiar with the religions he calls "Eastern mysticism " but modern physics not so much . I try to keep up with developments in science but found his presentation of modern physics tough going though I was familiar with its general outlines . Of course , there have been a lot of developments since this book was published in 1975 . But Capra 's statement Modern physics has confirmed most dramatically one of the basic ideas of Eastern mysticism ; that all the concepts we use to describe nature are limited , that they are not features of reality , as we tend to believe , but creations of the mind " will certainly stand the test of time .

The books themselves are a thing of legend at this point , so no need to review them . This edition is amazing , very well put together and extremely pleasant to look at and hold . The size is just right to carry around in a book bag , or anywhere really . The print is a little small in order to accommodate such a large amount of text in a small handbook -sized edition . The slipcase is also really nice . This will look handsome in any display . The cover pages for The Hobbit include Thror 's map in the opening endpaper , and a map of Wilderland in the closing endpaper . The Return of the King has multiple appendixes and calendars , and a plethora of other additional material at the end of the novel . All in all , this is a steal at around 35 bucks .####[([1], [5, 10], 'POS'), ([20], [22], 'POS'), ([-1], [24, 27], 'POS'), ([-1], [29, 35], 'POS'), ([38], [40, 48], 'POS'), ([55], [57, 59], 'NEU'), ([78], [81, 82], 'POS'), ([-1], [85, 90], 'POS')]####Books

Gives you a great look into the birth of the John Clark character that shows up in a few of his other books . Couldn 't stop turning the pages and just wanted it to go on as the story was great . Buy it and settle in for a page turner as the family clamors for dinner and you can 't stop reading .####[([-1], [24, 29], 'POS'), ([39], [41], 'POS'), ([-1], [59, 63], 'POS')]####Books
Amazing . That is basically the only word that I would explain this book . First of all , it came in a great packaging . No damage done to the book itself , and It comes in great state . This thing is just great to look at . The pages look like gold , and the cover is a leathery material . The drawings are great , too . It is basically exactly the same thing as the normal hobbit , but in a shiny , beautiful encasing . Bravo .####[([-1], [0], 'POS'), ([31], [26, 27], 'POS'), ([-1], [36, 39], 'POS'), ([42], [45], 'POS'), ([51], [52, 54], 'POS'), ([65], [67], 'POS'), ([89], [88], 'POS'), ([89], [86], 'POS')]####Books
I really like the author , both his style and his attention to detail , I must admit this was not one of my first choices of his work but I was more than surprised how much I enjoyed it . It worked well into the French pre -war history and the main character very believable . Wee done Mr .

Well , part of the plot is a little bit predictable and the other part is not very logical . Difficult to compare this book to other great classics as Muder in the orient express or Cat between pidgeons . Either way , an interesting and dynamic book that will not allow you to get tired before you reach the last page .####[([2, 5], [7, 10], 'NEU'), ([5], [16, 18], 'NEG'), ([24], [20, 22], 'NEU'), ([47], [44], 'POS'), ([47], [46], 'POS')]####Books

One of the best logical explanations of what Christians believe . Even if you aren 't a Christian , this well written , easy to understand book will at least give you a clear picture of the reasoned approach to faith , and the fundamental reasoning for that which Christians believe .####[([-1], [0, 9], 'POS'), ([26], [20, 21], 'POS'), ([26], [23, 25], 'POS')]####Books

The novel is creepy and scary . Also gross . Most of the characters are well drawn and believable , although a McDermid could have done better with the female journalist - who is about as complex as Rita Skeeter in "Harry Potter , " but without the sense of humor . I 'm not sure that the denouement is entirely believable , but by that point I was willing to go with the flow .####[([1], [3], 'NEU'), ([1], [5], 'NEU'), ([-1], [8], 'NEU'), ([13], [15, 16], 'POS'), ([13], [18], 'POS'), ([29, 30], [23, 26], 'NEG')]####Books

I have read and re -read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings several times over the last 45 years and will probably read them many times more over the ensuring years . I find some new or different each time I read them . I have also read the other books Professor Tolkien has written , and have found them to be just as engaging . If J . R R . Tolkien 's name is on the book cover , it is definitely worth your time to read it .####[([-1], [35, 43], 'POS'), ([-1], [22, 24], 'POS'), ([-1], [85, 90], 'POS')]####Books
