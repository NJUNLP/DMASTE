We first encountered these in the nationally popular Music Together [ TM ] class that we enrolled our kids in our local area . We knew immediately that we had to have one .

Take it to the drum circle if you want . As a bonus , it 's durable , well -made , and designed in such a way ( colorful artwork , rubber feet , lightweight , rubber -tipped stick ) as to be kid -friendly in every way . This is light years ahead of any toystore drum (most of which are pale excuses for any sort of musical instrument , if they even manage to be that ) and for the price is an absolute steal .####[([-1], [37, 41], 'POS'), ([-1], [90], 'POS'), ([-1], [92, 93], 'POS'), ([96], [117, 121], 'POS'), ([103], [102], 'POS'), ([106], [105], 'POS'), ([-1], [108], 'POS'), ([112], [110, 111], 'POS'), ([130, 131], [125, 129], 'POS'), ([156], [159, 160], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

This is pretty much the Operation I remember . Or at least as close as it 's going to get . Avoid the other version with the horrible reviews .

It 's a neat toy and is great for a puzzle -loving kid . But there 's no lid . Nothing to hold all those pieces in one spot . Nothing to put on top so that a young child could confidently walk it over to its spot to be put away . Nothing to cover it so that you can toss it in the car to bring on a trip whether long or short . Nothing to protect the pieces from being scattered everywhere when you forget you 've placed it on the top of the stack of books and it all comes tumbling down . Nothing to contain all the pieces when your child grows out of it and you want to donate it to a thrift store . Good luck keeping all the pieces . Other than the lid thing , it 's great .

I would also recomment that you buy a new little doll to go with the 3 -in -1 buggy .####[([1, 10], [12, 14], 'POS'), ([-1], [30, 34], 'POS'), ([-1], [40, 42], 'POS'), ([62], [61], 'POS'), ([62], [65, 66], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games
Our boys love these and can do them for hours on end . The whole neighborhood enjoys them , so for us , we need to replace them quite often because kids can 't get along , aren 't careful with the product , and often don 't listen to rules about keeping the rockets away from the house . We end up with a lot of rockets on the roof and a stomped out blaster because of all the commotion , but still a great value and toy to keep the kids occupied !####[([-1], [2], 'POS'), ([-1], [14, 16], 'POS'), ([86], [85], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

This is a really fun game . It 's got the weird cooky factor without being too gross . I play with my three year old son . It has blank cards to add my own items and we did right away . I add new things all the time . It is also easily altered to play as your child 's age dictates . Very fun ! The one thing I might say is the cards have a general idea as to what you need to pull out of neds ears , nose or mouth , but it is not an exact picture of the item . That bothered my son at first because he didn 't think he 'd found the right item . It didn 't "match " perfectly . Other than that fun game .####[([5], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([-1], [9, 17], 'POS'), ([30, 31], [33, 36], 'POS'), ([-1], [54, 63], 'POS'), ([-1], [65, 66], 'POS'), ([-1], [127, 131], 'NEG'), ([106], [100, 104], 'NEG'), ([-1], [109], 'NEG')]####Toys_and_Games
This has become a Christmas tradition in our house . Our kids (age 3 and 2 ) race to find Bernie - our elf on the shelf - every morning . It 's fun for me and hubby too because we love to get creative at night hiding /positioning our elf all over the house . If you don 't celebrate Santa then it probably won 't have the same excitement /meaning for you . YOu could try hiding something else - a baby Jesus or Menorah but really the kids love finding the elf because they think he is going to tell Santa what they want for Christmas . Of course , most kids love hide and seek so would find this fun even if they don 't believe in Santa .

These made a perfect gift for a friend 's daughter on her 7th birthday . The "tubs " are a great value with plenty of beads in different colors and a handful of templates . We also got her some extra templates , including some large square ones , so she could make any design she could imagine . Unfortunately , by the end of her birthday party , the adults had gathered around the kitchen table and used up half the tub ! I felt bad , so I gave her the butterfly I had made and promised I would get her another tub .

I bought this to use in our summer 's kid -carnival party . They LOVED using it . Actually , they were fighting over who got to go next . I read several reviews before deciding which spinner to purchase , and think I really did make a good choice . This one is easy to use , has enough battery power to spin nicely (instead of hand powered ) . Of course people complain that you need to buy replacement paper /paint . But really , if your creative , make your own paint squirt bottles . Fabric paint from Michaels works good . And just save some of the cardboard as a template to cut out more paper from cardstock . One piece of advice . . . make sure you have your paint area covered nicely to prevent paint from spilling . They were so excited to show everyone their creations , that many of them ended up on my kitchen floor .

I did look at a number of different cribs before choosing this one . Originally I wanted a brown crib but the quality appeared to be lacking in other brands so I settled for white . On receiving this crib it was apparent that you will need 2 people to construct this however certainly someone more engineer minded could do it by themself . In any event the wood is sturdy and once built this is an impressive crib that will last for a long time . It does come with bedding which is nice and it is big enough for larger dolls . It can rock side to side but is steady enough that it won 't tip over . It was brought for a 2 year old that loves playing mommy .

This product was great ! That was until we tried to put together the pig . That was when we realized that we have some duplicate pictures on some of the blocks . That means no matter how hard my daughter tries she can never get the picture to look right . So buyer beware that you might only have a few animals that your child can put together correctly . We did compare the blocks to the picture just to confirm the block mistake . I had my wife double check the blocks just to make sure . I would have rated it 4 stars except the pictures don 't all match up . I don 't know how long the blocks would hold up because the pictures are just stickers .

Yesterday was my son 's birthday and with everything he recieved - and there was a lot - this was his absolute favorite item . The rocket goes straight up and it really gets some distance . The harder you step on the launcher , the further it goes . Not just the kids either , the adults were having a blast with it as well . It seems very sturdy and I imagine I will need to buy replacement rockets since what comes up , must go down , and hits cement .

First the batteries are really hard to get in and out . Plus whether we installed the batteries the shuffler would work upside down but not right side up . Fixed this by putting piece of napkin between battery and door . Also the cards sometimes get stuck . Have to pause and reseat them .

Overall this table has been great . I had it out of the box , legs pushed into the holes and a bag of sand poured into it and ready for my kids in 15 minutes or less . Quite literally the day I got this set up we had a huge rainstorm and the cover did it 's job and didn 't let any water in . This table is the perfect size for 1 - 3 kids and the toys that came with it are nice , not cheap , and they are primarily what my children use when playing with this sand table . It was nice to not have to go out and get accessories for them to use before they could enjoy this table . It holds one small bag of play sand (0 .5 cubic feet , probably roughly 25 pounds ? ) nicely and could hold a LITTLE more than that but I just put one bag in . I feel like the table is a little shallow , however my children certainly don 't seem to mind and I 'm just glad that I chose this one instead of a more traditional one that would be larger , more difficult to move , and would require my children to sit in the sand while playing .####[([2], [5], 'POS'), ([73], [72], 'POS'), ([81], [87], 'POS'), ([81], [89, 90], 'POS'), ([128], [126], 'POS'), ([-1], [186, 192], 'POS'), ([55], [61, 66], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games
Even though Don 't Break the Ice isn 't as popular as some other children 's games out there (think Candyland ) I think it is a classic and should be just as popular ! It is a simple , but suspenseful , game - kinda like Jenga , but horizontal . Setting the game up isn 't too fun though , as you need to turn the thing upside down and tightly pack all the ice cubes in there . . . then turn it back over and push the ice skater into the ice without breaking the ice .

This purse and items seemed to be really cheap online , but I wanted my daughter to have her own purse and felt that even if it was junk to me , she would love it . She loves the purse and everything in it . She plays with the phone just as much as her Vtech phone . The debit card and wallet are sooo cute . I love the material of the bag , it has a leathery feel to it . The toys are also a better quality than I thought . I would buy this again as a gift for other little girls . She also walks around applying and reapplying her plastic lipstick . I don 't know where she gets that from . : ) The big plus for me is that she now constantly turns over her own bag and replaces the items instead of mine .####[([1, 3], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([40], [38], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [65, 66], 'POS'), ([63], [65, 66], 'POS'), ([71, 74], [69], 'POS'), ([80], [79], 'POS'), ([85], [89, 90], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

Saw this game being used on a tv programme and thought it was a great idea . Reviews were a bit hit and miss and I can understand why . Takes quite a while to set up each game , squeezing the last cube into place is hard . When you turn the block over and try to bang out cubes nearly always more than one drops out . Keeping strictly to your chosen cube doesn 't make any difference . The hammers were very light so again , kids had to keep banging a cube before it would drop out . I also thought it was expensive . The product is really flimsey . Having said all this my grandkids enjoyed playing the game and trying not to knock the polar bear into the ice . Wouldn 't recommend .####[([-1], [40, 47], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [30, 33], 'NEG'), ([60], [61, 67], 'NEG'), ([82], [84, 85], 'NEG'), ([95], [90, 93], 'NEG'), ([-1], [107], 'NEG'), ([110], [113], 'NEG'), ([124], [121, 122], 'POS'), ([-1], [137, 139], 'NEG')]####Toys_and_Games

I purchased this game to help reinforce reading strategies at home with my elementary -aged child . The tactile aspect of this resource makes it very appealing to children , and moving the tiles about helps with word attack skills . Word of warning , however : there are thousands of word combinations with the onset tiles and rimes , and that includes words that are , well , not age -appropriate .

We love this . We decided to try this instead of Elf on Shelf . I didn 't read the part about not being allowed to touch him . Cute story and my 4 year old loved it , especially Christopher . However , the problem we have now is does not want him to go back to the North Pole . She cried for 20 min in bed xmas eve night because she didn 't want him to leave . I did not want her to be sad (when she should be super happy /excited ) so we said he could stay longer and I tried to explain he is just for fun . This is why I gave it 4 stars because your child might be extremely upset when it 's time for the elf to leave : (####[([-1], [1], 'POS'), ([30], [29], 'POS'), ([30], [36], 'POS'), ([40], [36], 'POS'), ([-1], [63, 66], 'NEG'), ([-1], [124, 129], 'NEG')]####Toys_and_Games

Smart Mouth is the perfect name for this word game in which players must make words using the pairs of first and last letters . Though you really do not need the game pieces to play , having the tiles and dispenser helps ramdonize the letter choices and reloading the dispenser gives younger kids a kick . The instructions are clear and offer a variety of options for playing so that the game does not get stale too fast . Thought the concept is pretty neat , the game itself it poorly designed . Once you dispense a pair of tiles , you have to remove them from the base , and then you loose them - - -all over the car , the floor , the table . It would have been simple and useful just to create a bigger base for the game . The packaging is wasteful and ridiculous . The game comes in a large box , but it would easily fit in a box one third the size .

I have the original mastermind board and over the years it is missing some of the little pieces here and there . I decided it was time for an upgrade .

The holding tray to put the pegs was a nice idea , but it 's not big enough for all the pegs and if you put the big pegs and the little pegs in , you have to sort them each and every time you want to play the game .

I ordered this because I was looking for a toy to take with us when my husband and I go places and our child needs something to play with in the room that is quiet (church , talks , etc ) . I liked the added bonus of it being a fill and spill toy and saw that many reviewers commented how great it was for church . Perfect ! Well . . . it is quiet but it is NOT SILENT . Each little bird rattles (but thankfully no crinkles ) . The rattle is about the volume of the foot finder rattles so it is not too loud and I 'm hoping will work for our purpose . We 'll find out soon ! As for now , it is a cute toy that she was immediately interested in . The birds fit in the hole very well and can be dumped out in multiple ways .

I bought those separately and sent along with toy so they can play with it . Should be great on days they can 't play outside .####[([-1], [66, 73], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

I bought this for my daughter 's Easter basket this past year . I like that this toy teaches colors , shapes , and some fine motor skills . Plus , it 's a natural addition to an Easter basket . We 've had many hours of enjoyment talking about the different colors we see and the shapes we 're looking at on the bottom of the eggs , putting the eggs in the carton , taking them out , etc . I don 't like that the eggs barely "chirp . " The sound they make is really just a high -pitched squeaky noise that 's created by pushing the eggs down . Not really a chirp per say . However , for me , the educational benefits outweigh this drawback .

This puzzle is nice at the top ; however , the whale doesn 't have enough to differentiation in colors . My 3 year old can complete 48 piece puzzles alone in under 15 minutes so I wanted a challenge for him by buying 100 piece puzzle .

We had a neighborhood party and these were used for face painting . They just dipped these in some water and started making designs on the kids faces . The designs turned out very well and at the end of the night they also washed off pretty easily . On paper they are also easy to use , especially fun for young kids to make a pretty watercolor without all the hassle of the paintbrushes and watercolors . The other thing I like about them is they last quite a while - and for the price they are awesome ! ! I have a 4 . 5 yr old son and 2 .5 yr old daughter .

First off this item came with a foul oil all over it that had to be washed off with soap and water . Not that big an issue just nasty stuff , the problem I have is , there doesn 't appear to be any leaks but it won 't hold air for longer then 20 minutes . I 'm guessing it 's the cheap plug for the hole that leaks slowly . Yes you have to inflate this yourself . I expected this to come fully inflated and factory sealed . I also expected it to be made with a much better and thicker wall . This bouncer is made of what seems like a thicker beach ball kind of plastic . Not happy at all with it .

My kiddos are 2 and 5 and they love this set . They can swing as high as they like without us worrying about it tipping over (after it 's staked ) . Assembly was a chore , only because we assembled the slide side completely before the swing add -on . The directions you get are for each piece individually so you don 't realize that the crossbeam at the top of the slide part will have to be taken apart to install the swing part . So we lost time on that . The directions were also confusing - rudimentary pictures rather than instructions . 11mo Update : Still in great shape and got through a scorching Tucson summer without fading .####[([10], [8], 'POS'), ([-1], [14, 23], 'POS'), ([33], [36], 'NEG'), ([68], [77, 86], 'NEG'), ([96], [99], 'NEG'), ([105], [101, 103], 'NEG'), ([113], [112], 'POS'), ([-1], [115, 122], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

My son loves this Woody . I read a few people saying this Woody doesn 't sound like Tom Hanks , or the pull string Woody in the movie . Ours does . The phrases that Woody says in the movie ( "there 's a snake in my boot " , "Reach for the sky ! " , "Someone 's poisoned the water hole ! " , etc . ) sounds exactly as the pull string Woody in the movie . The only drawback for my son , was he did want to take the cow boots off . As mentioned in prior reviews , they are not meant to come off , and Woody doesn 't have feet , just stubs . He 's played with it for nearly two months now , and it works just as perfectly as it did when it arrived . He has been a little rough with the string and we had to break him of the habit of carrying Woody around by holding the loop of the pull string ; despite the roughness , Woody 's string has stayed perfectly intact .####[([4], [2], 'POS'), ([70], [71, 79], 'POS'), ([136], [137, 139], 'POS'), ([182, 184], [186, 188], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

Fantastic Chess -like strategy game . This adds a little randomness to your 2 -player abstract strategy game .

This is a nice card game for girls 7 and up . It features 4 equestrian themed 'events ' ( Jumper , Hunter , Equitation , Dressage ) - and the object is to collect blue ribbons . Players take turn alternating who hosts a show - and depending on the number of players , there will be 3 -4 events per show . Certain horses in your hand will have a better chance than others in certain shows - and some horses have penalties for a particular ribbon . There is a bit of strategy - but not so much that younger children are at a disadvantage against older kids or their parents .

Mine came ripped . Unfortunately I didn 't take it out of the package until one day after the return date . It is very cheaply made and sewn - -and made of flammable materials .

This is a really fun tent ! It fits all three of my kids at the same time . They love to take it outdoors and play with it , which is nice with the SPF protection on a hot and sunny day . My eight month old loves to play with it too , which is useful since its been too hot for him to be in the sun ! Its also very easy to put up and take down , and comes with a bag to store the tent .

I bought this CD player for my 2 year old daughter because she uses all sorts of things to sing into , from spoons to sticks to my cats tail (he doesn 't appreciate that at all ) . It is true what others have said about not being able to control the volume of the microphones . They do squeal when they are close to the player as well . I had to teach my daughter to hold the microphones away from her mouth and to sit back from the player a bit , when she does those two things it works great . She really enjoys using the player . She and I , or her brother , sing together so we really like that it has two microphones . I didn 't get it for educational purposes , though she does use it to play book CD 's , I still don 't think it 's an educational toy and I don 't think they advertise it in that manner either . In my opinion it 's definitely worth the money . We have lots of fun with it !####[([53], [47, 51], 'NEG'), ([-1], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([102], [103], 'POS'), ([110], [106, 108], 'POS'), ([129, 130], [124, 125], 'POS'), ([-1], [180, 183], 'POS'), ([-1], [185, 190], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

I got this as a way to introduce my 5 year old son to the idea of shaving . He has seen me shave before , and he seemed curious about it , so this was a great tool for letting him try it out for himself safely . The shaver is great , no complaints with that . There is no razer so there 's no risk of cutting himself , it 's mostly just for wiping the shaving cream off his face . The shaving cream also says it 's soap , but I haven 't really put that to the test in any way . The brush was mostly ineffective . and the mirror is good enough to help him see what he 's doing . We haven 't used the comb yet . I think this is a good buy for any young boy who is curious about shaving .####[([38], [37], 'POS'), ([61, 62], [66, 69], 'POS'), ([109], [111, 112], 'NEG'), ([116], [118, 119], 'POS'), ([50], [52], 'POS'), ([50], [54, 56], 'POS'), ([143], [142], 'POS'), ([61, 62], [66, 69], 'POS'), ([86, 87], [92], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games
I purchased this Pizza Party kit for my 4 year old son because he always makes pizza with my husband . He loves to pretend play that he is a "Pizza man " . He uses the tray as a cash register and any left over toppings not on the pizza are his "money " . This set is very durable and can withstand a good amount of abuse from kids without breaking . However , parents with younger children should heed caution when younger children are playing with this as it can pose a choking hazard with the toppings . It would be tough for a smaller child to swallow one of the toppings but that 's not to say it can 't happen . Also , gnawing on the pieces can cause them to splinter and causes the paint to come off . Overall , I would highly recommend this product to anyone . Quality products that last are becoming hard to come by . And I foresee this being in our household for years to come .####[([57], [59, 60], 'POS'), ([99], [92, 96], 'NEG'), ([152], [149, 150], 'POS'), ([-1], [168, 169], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

We try to minimize TV time by playing fun games at least every other night if we can . This is a fun game for her , easy , quick to learn and quick to play . It 's not long and drawn out , it 's perfect for the attention span 3 year olds have ! It 's also really cute with the lady bugs . You get a game board and the game pieces are cardboard and the lady bugs sit in little plastic stands . The each have names that go along with their color (i .e . , Olivia Orange ) .

I bought this set for my two year old son with a few reservations . It is ceramic . Which is breakable . I thought for sure it was going to last for a few hours , maybe one tea party at best , but was hopeful . I wanted something he could put real liquids in . I 'm so happy I took the gamble and bought this set . It 's extremely affordable , even compared to the plastic sets . The little tea cups could hold a golf ball , but he gets a few sips out of them before they 're empty . They are very small compared to adult hands , but are a perfect fit for him .
