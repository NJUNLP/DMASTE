Although I have seen some 3 year olds play this , it seems best for the ages stated 4 - 8 , at least for independent play . I purchased it for my classroom of preschoolers with special needs . I am adapting the way we use it to encourage even more speaking , turn taking , and social interaction , but it already does this pretty well . When I observed other children using it they had no trouble using it independently in a small group of 3 to 5 children once they understood how to play . It is a game that is frequently requested and played with amazingly little conflict considering the competitive aspects . The children usually play until everyone wins and even help each other . The dispenser is well designed and sturdy as are the plastic pieces . I recommend it for home and the classroom .####[([-1], [77, 80], 'POS'), ([102], [105, 106], 'POS'), ([102], [108, 116], 'POS'), ([132], [134, 135], 'POS'), ([141, 142], [137], 'POS'), ([132], [137], 'POS'), ([-1], [145], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

With Magna Tiles , you just hold pieces next to each other and they snap together ! They have great balance , too .

Be careful when you order this ! The same set is being sold by different sellers on Amazon for very different prices .

This is absolutely the most used toy in our household . My 2 year old boy is fascinated with vacuums (wants to watch YouTube vacuum demonstration videos all the time , too ) and he now has this one , a small real dust buster , and a new yellow toy vacuum that actually works . If you are looking for one that doesn 't actually do anything , this one is a good choice . Just know it is very loud when it is used (the sound it makes when it moves is much louder than the sound of the faux motor when it is turned on ) and that your child may have some trouble getting it from a standing position to a reclining one . We just broke the piece that kept it up and he is much happier now that he can stand it up and lean it down on his own .

My 3 year old LOVES these planets . I thought they were incredibly easy to put up . They have a nice glow to them . My son is completely fascinated by them and his imagination and interest in planets , stars and everything space has exploded . I am 100 % satisfied with my purchase . As far as the star stickers , we didn 't put them up since he already had much larger glow in the dark stars and a moon on his ceiling . I figure he can use them on paper or other places later . The planets make a perfect addition to his room .####[([6], [4], 'POS'), ([-1], [12, 16], 'POS'), ([-1], [19, 22], 'POS'), ([-1], [29, 30], 'POS'), ([35], [46], 'POS'), ([37], [46], 'POS'), ([55], [50, 52], 'POS'), ([102], [105, 109], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

My daughter loves these ! I guess she uses these at her school for her stem class and just had to have them . . there are so many different circuit designs and projects in the two books it comes with to keep your child entertained forever .

She learns to read instructions every time , about electrical currents , how to read diagrams , and how to take care of smal objects . Like I said earlier there are hundreds of different circuit plans to keep your child busy for a long time .

Does my 4 year old like it ? Yes . Which is why it gets two stars . The game goes on FOREVER ! I 'm not sure why there are not more complaints about this .

Great detail and fairly durable . A great toy for our little guy , who loves all things that go . The spring motor is a little weak for something this size , but that doesn 't matter much to us . Ultimately the stop sign was broken off , and the bus got stepped on , so the axles are bent , but that just makes it much more humorous to see it wobble across the floor . The front doors require fine dexterity to close (opening is easy , just mash your little finger through them ! ) with tiny knobs under the bus . So consider how many times you may be asked to close them if your kid is younger than say 5 or so ! : - ) Update 2017 : About 3 years later and it is still running . It sees some rougher play now , going off ramps , into walls , etc , but the spring motor still works . The rear door was broken off and re -attached with gauze and superglue , but it all still looks the part of a nice school bus . We easily got our money 's worth out of this and it is still giving enjoyment .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([-1], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([8], [7], 'POS'), ([22, 23], [26, 27], 'NEG'), ([44, 45], [47, 48], 'NEG'), ([80, 81], [82, 86], 'NEG'), ([-1], [136, 139], 'POS'), ([164, 165], [166, 167], 'POS'), ([-1], [197, 203], 'POS'), ([-1], [209, 211], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games
I really like this game . It 's not as fun if your significant other or someone you play with on a regular basis wins almost every time , though . He 's fast . It doesn 't seem fair . I can win one or two rounds , maybe , but at least I usually fare better if there are more people playing . I 'm not the best or the worst . Anyway , it 's just a game where you have to flip cards really fast and be good at identifying numbers in sequence and color recognition . The main skill is flipping cards fast and playing them fast . Having fast reflexes is an absolute must for winning . I would recommend this game , at any rate . I like the challenge and commiserate with my fellow losers when we get whipped .####[([4], [0, 2], 'POS'), ([127], [125], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

My father has alzheimer 's and in addition , he has had many small strokes and is a cancer survivor . He used to put together puzzles that were thousands of pieces but this is about all he can do now and he has trouble with these .

My father would not like putting together puzzles with GI Joe or Barbie but he has put together this one and a few others .

My toddler son attends a weekly music class that uses this brand of drum . He was becoming resourceful in repurposing many household items into drums (most notably , baking pans . . .thanks , Gram . . . ) despite a couple of toy drums he has . The wood -on -wood or wood -on -metal was driving me a little crazy . This drum is the perfect size . It 's large but he can easily carry it around (and does ) . The mallets are soft rubber and despite his enthusiastic drumming , the sound is mellow , low , and not obtrusive . It 's much more pleasant to the ear . The drum is excellent quality and holds up well in a classroom -type environment , so I expect this will last a long time . The artwork around the outside is also attractive and my son was able to identify some of the animals .####[([69], [68], 'POS'), ([86], [88], 'POS'), ([97], [99, 105], 'POS'), ([120], [119], 'POS'), ([142], [148], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games

I bought this for my 4 -year -old . I had one like it as a kid and remember it as being mind -blowingly awesome . This one is not . It doesn 't focus very well , there 's no definition or crispness to what you see , which diminishes the educational value greatly , in my opinion . I won 't send it back , because it was so cheap that postage will be half the price anyway , and at least I can console myself in knowing that when my kid loses interest in 3 minutes I didn 't go under for this . Given that my kid is 4 , this is no big loss . . . When he breaks it I will congratulate myself on the money I saved !

I bought these for my 23 month old . She already knows her colors and shapes , so this was not educational for her in that way (but could be useful for a child who is learning those concepts ) . I was hoping it would be a good introduction to pattern blocks , since I figured she is a bit young for a full set of traditional small ones . However , this set includes cirles and ovals , which simply can not work like traditional pattern blocks , and the triangles are not equilateral . Therefore , we can 't do much independent patterning with these . So , as an alternative to wooden knob puzzles , these are a good puzzle .

This product is very fine , and requires substantial amounts to be posed individually , to get the absolute most realistic effect . Because of this , I feel that out of all the Woodland Scenics products , this product is one of the most technical . If you are not a seasoned modeler ( I 'm not ) , but have developed a cool patience , then this product can greatly enhance the look of a diorama with an autumnal or transitional theme . Posed together with burnt leaves , yellow straw , and late -fall colors , along with a sparse , dusty , bare -earth base , it would not be difficult to invoke in the viewer through your diorama , that the days are getting shorter , the shadows growing longer , and the walk becoming more brisk , and maybe , hopefully , the realization that autumn has come home .####[([1], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([39], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([69], [70, 77], 'POS'), ([1], [7, 13], 'POS'), ([1], [19, 21], 'POS')]####Toys_and_Games
