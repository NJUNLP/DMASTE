The fact that this toy is double ended so you can put treats in both sides it hilarious if you have two dogs , it either causes fights between the dogs as one tries to steal it from the other end while the other is eating .

At first I thought I had ordered the wrong thing , because this strip is so narrow . However , after using it for a month , it is perfect . I have 5 little male terriers that occasionally mark in the house . The strip only needs to be wide enough so that two of the dog 's feet touch it . So , if I place it about 6 inches from a piece of furniture , they have to stand on it to lift their leg . I can move this strip around to their favorite places and stop the behavior . I don 't need a strip for every spot . It has reduced in house marking by about 90 % . With persistence I 'm hoping to stop it completely . I thought this strip was very expensive , but realize it was well worth the money .####[([13], [16], 'NEG'), ([-1], [29], 'POS'), ([-1], [115, 122], 'POS'), ([138], [140, 141], 'NEG'), ([-1], [147, 150], 'POS')]####Pet_Supplies
Great product ! Works as described . I left my 2 cats for 4 days , and although I left enough dry food out for them , I wanted something to dispense their daily can of wet food , and this did the job beautifully ! The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the food receptacles are made of plastic (stainless or ceramic would have made this product perfect ! ) . This is very easy to set up , and the two ice packs help for a day , but defrost quickly . It helps to freeze the cat food cans for a couple of days , so when the cat is ready to eat it , it is at room temperature but has been preserved longer . . . .

Seems like a good idea , but not very accurate . Purchased to use during a tank transfer method for new arrivals . This was showing 0 ammonia the morning we had a dead fish . I used a Salifert test kit to check the water and the ammonia was high enough to be lethal . I have had one of these in the past that never showed any ammonia level , but assumed it was because there was no ammonia . Skip this and use a test kit , it only takes a few minutes and could save the life of an expensive fish .####[([-1], [7, 9], 'NEG'), ([-1], [25, 27], 'NEG'), ([-1], [82, 83], 'NEG')]####Pet_Supplies

It still gets the surface hot enough for my snake , and I 'll be able to switch the mat to a new enclosure easily as she grows .

There was one pregnant female who looked like she was ready to explode so I bought this in hopes that the fry would have somewhere to hide . I allowed these to float because I did not have any floating plants . I also read other customers who had great success by floating instead of tethering these things down . Today (within 2 days of setting these out ) , I saw that the female had a much slimmer belly so I started looking for babies . Lo and behold , there was one that was hiding in the floating breeding grass ! I looked around more and was able to save a total of four babies which is more than enough to keep sustaining my aquarium . That was well worth the cost of the breeding grass .

My older service dog has back and joint injuries , so our veterinarian suggested giving him daily glucosamine /chondroitin supplements . I originally bought this product from a local pet store , but Amazon 's price is much lower . Dog chews and swallows this tablet quickly with no complaints .####[([35], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([45], [40, 43], 'POS')]####Pet_Supplies
my dog is not allowed on the couch and he knows to sneak on only when we 're not home or sleeping . normal training methods did not work in discouraging him off the couch . the scat mat did the trick the very first night . it worked so well that it took a lot of coaxing just to get him back into the same room as the couch . please do touch the mat for yourself to help determine the setting for your animal . we found that the high setting is quite painful , and the medium setting was more than enough to scare our 75lbs doberman . the low setting feels like a decent static shock and should provide enough discomfort to remind our dog to stay off the couch , although he has yet to attempt to get on the sofa since .####[([37, 38], [39, 41], 'POS'), ([48], [49, 50], 'POS'), ([91, 92], [94, 95], 'NEG'), ([99, 100], [102, 104], 'NEU'), ([112, 113], [117, 119], 'POS'), ([112, 113], [121, 124], 'POS')]####Pet_Supplies

WOW , this works really well . I have a Tamaskan ( Husky -Shepard mix , basically ) and he doesn 't like most of the steel wire brushes , and most of the standard prong brushes don 't work at all for him . This brush , however , works outstandingly and he really doesn 't mind it .

Love this brand ! It is so hard to tear this material up . I put 2 puppy milkbone treats in this dog bone and my 4 month old Basset mix goes to town on it . Her puppy teeth never penetrate through the material . She 's happy chewing away till treat is all gone . Update : She 's now 10 months old and still hasn 't tore this bone up . She 's a major chewer too ! I stick peanut butter in it now and it keeps her busy for a while .

This has to be the best dog grooming brush I have experienced thusfar . So simple and yet so effective . I have also used it on my short haired cat with great results - never thought my cat had so much hair . She feels so sleek and smooth now . My two Corgi dogs ' hair comes out in handfulls and they have long and thick hair . The dogs love it and indicate , in their voices , that they want more . They turn their bodies around , I guess to make sure I have gotten it all ! ! Heh ! Heh !

I wanted to upgrade my fishes current food since they were store brand and I wanted to better my fishes food . I already knew that Ocean Nutrition makes some wonderful fish food with great ingredients . First time I put this food in the tank they swarm right to the surface and started eating . They were becoming more interested in feeding time , and no food was wasted the first time feeding this . This is a very big jar of fish food so I probably won 't be buying any more anytime soon , this food should last me 4 months or even longer . Here are the guaranteed analysis since amazon doesn 't list them . Crude Protein (min ) 58 . 6 % Crude Fat (min ) 15 .6 % Crude Fiber (max ) 1 .8 % Moisture (max ) 7 .2 % Ash (max ) 4 .8 % Phosphorus (min ) 0 .6 %####[([42], [47, 54], 'POS'), ([67], [66], 'POS'), ([81], [79, 80], 'POS'), ([98], [99, 106], 'POS')]####Pet_Supplies

my oscar loves this product . in fact it is all he will accept for breakfast . I made the mistake of buying sun dried krill for him because it was cheaper but the texture isn 't quite right and he won 't eat it . The krill are reasonably sized and become edible after being soaked in water for minutes . The best part is that my cat now knows that I will be soaking the oscars krill in water and she likes the "krill " juice . So every morning my cat eagerly awaits the krill preparation . On a more practical note , the price on the internet was much cheaper than what I could find in town .####[([-1], [2], 'POS'), ([47], [49, 50], 'POS'), ([47], [52, 60], 'POS')]####Pet_Supplies
My cat loves this food . Specifically in the chicken and herring flavor . He 's not a fan of the other ones . He 's been eating this for over a year and his coat is beautiful and he has a ton of energy .

I previously had a Mega which worked a couple years . This one was a Total Disaster . Never could get rake to work , Littermaid customer service (once you finally get to is ) was of little help and Orange Onion ( don 't buy anything from them ) sucked . They couldn 't care less , at least Littermaid apologized (on one of my three calls ) . Keep in mind , if you buy it and return it , do it through Littermaid . You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire . To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid ! ) , unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire , don 't let it go ! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment . I wasted hours and hours on this . If only they had a good competitor . They 're sending me the only thing available , the latest model that most people here seem to hate . sigh . .if it doesn 't work , I 'm giving up totally on Littermaid . I have two cats , so it had its uses .####[([-1], [15, 16], 'NEG'), ([25, 27], [36, 38], 'NEU'), ([40, 41], [43, 47], 'NEG'), ([40, 41], [50], 'NEG'), ([-1], [53, 56], 'NEG'), ([60], [61, 67], 'NEU'), ([99, 100], [98], 'NEG'), ([176, 177], [182, 184], 'NEG'), ([-1], [190, 192], 'NEG'), ([200], [194, 199], 'NEG')]####Pet_Supplies
