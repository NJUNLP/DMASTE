I am a 28 yo male and I use many Jack Black products because of their commitment to nature , science , and more importantly men 's skin . I use the Protein Booster Skin Serum , Energizing Scrub , Double Duty Lotion , and now this night cream . It provides instant hydration without leaving behind an oily residue . I used to use Zirh Rejuvenate as my night cream and that worked well but it is harder and harder to find Zirh in stores or online anymore . The Jack Black Dry Erase Ultra Calming cream is just what it says it is . It provides moisture and calms the skin after even the harsher and cheaper face washes . Combine this with the Protein Serum and Double Duty Moisturizer for day use and you have a comprehensive day /night regime that provides your skin with the ant drying and ant aging moisture it needs .####[([-1], [51, 59], 'POS'), ([-1], [107, 108], 'POS'), ([-1], [110, 112], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

The actual polish is a little thicker than what I 'm used to from other brands but the results are so much better than any other brands .

I 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff . When it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap . This stuff is no different . Proraso is a very good shaving product . It doesn 't have the variety of scents that other soaps /creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low -frills product . The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort . It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick . It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm . The only gripe I have is the scent . I don 't particularly care for the soapy scent . It 's not bad , I just wouldn 't wear it as a cologne . Of course , smell is completely subjective . Like most all soaps , the scent doesn 't linger for more than a few minutes anyway . Overall , the soap performs great . There 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months . It performs as well as TOBS , but 25 % less expensive .####[([33], [63], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

Toile is a gorgeous , bright pinky coral shade that is very pigmented but easy to sheer out on the cheeks . Unfortunately I do not get the wear out of this that some other reviewers do . I 've yet to find a blush that wears for more than a couple of hours on me though , and I suspect this has to do with my very oily skin . That said it does wear longer than most other blushes on my skin . The packaging of this is cute but makes me nervous because it is so lightweight and the product inside is heavy .

I REALLY want to love this drying lotion as so many other users do . I bought this expecting my breakouts to magically disappear overnight . When I received it , it was definitely shaken so I 'm wondering if that has something to do with it not working . After letting it settle , I dab it on any trouble areas using a q tip . You have to go down into the pink stuff at the bottom . I will say , I like the smell . It makes me feel like its doing the job . It also burns a little after I apply it . Then I typically go to sleep (hoping I don 't run into anyone in the middle of the night - it leaves little pink /white spots on your face ) and wake up in the morning and wash my face as usual .

Typically , CND is known for high quality and this polish did not come close to meeting my expectations . The color is not pretty whatsoever , so I have to use an additive or another polish over the top to transform the color . Plus , a week into my manicure , and the tips of my nails are all faded and the polish is wearing away . I do not have this problem with other brands of gel polish , which are much cheaper priced than CND ! I should have returned this . . .####[([2], [11, 18], 'NEG'), ([21], [23, 24], 'NEG'), ([-1], [55, 61], 'NEG'), ([64], [64], 'NEG'), ([79, 80], [69, 77], 'NEG'), ([-1], [90, 93], 'NEG')]####Luxury_Beauty

It does clean but it rolls in your hand and is kind of awkward to use . And I did not really feel my face was clean so I used a cleanser after .

While it is expensive , it 's the only sunscreen I 've used that feels more like moisturizer than sunscreen . Not greasy at all . Great for wearing under makeup . I 'd been looking for a light face sunscreen for a while , and tried so many drugstore and department store brand . This one is definitely the best .

I tried this shampoo after using the Awapuhi shampoo and this one is much better IMO . My hair is baby fine and tends to get oily after one day even though I am 29 years old . I wanted a shampoo that could help my hair feel clean , voluminous ,and didn 't harm animals . This product has everything I need . It has a coconut smell but its not bothersome - coming from someone who doesn 't care for coconut scents . It 's lather is less soapy than the Awapuhi and has more of a thick lather . I like it more because it makes my hair feel clean within any greasy build up . It also helps my hair feel less oily over time . I purchased the one liter because it is 3 times the product of the smaller bottle you find at Target and roughly twice the price so it 's a better deal . The standard bottle lasts around 2 months with daily usage . This bottle will probably last half the year ! I also support the cruelty free stance of Paul Mitchell and his products are some of the best in that market . Other vegan products have made my hair feel dull and just sit on my head without cleaning my hair . This product gets the job done without the guilt !####[([3], [13, 15], 'POS'), ([41], [52, 55], 'POS'), ([58], [59, 62], 'POS'), ([68], [71, 72], 'POS'), ([87], [89, 90], 'POS'), ([100], [96, 99], 'POS'), ([-1], [108, 112], 'POS'), ([-1], [121, 126], 'POS'), ([160], [159], 'POS'), ([194], [196, 199], 'POS'), ([225], [226, 229], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

I love this cream . I wash my face before bed and put on the cream and wake up with such soft skin . Great for anytime especially when the heat is on in the winter .

This gel nail polish stays put for three weeks , or more when used with base and top coat . I have kept it on without changing for three weeks . I changed only then because my nails needed filing and new growth was visible . You also need to set polish with uv light sold here at Amazon . I love it . No chips at all . This stuff is indestructible . I wash my hands numerous times daily in addition to using hand sanitizer multiple times . Nothing breaks this stuff down . Nails look the same the 21st day as the 1st day . Only takes a total of 30 minutes per manicure . Salons charge $ 40 or more for gel nails .

When I saw a hint of dryness under my eyes compared to the rest of the face , I went straight for this product because of the hyaluronic ingredient in this cream . Yes , it hydrates the skin very well , but not with satisfaction . The cream is thick , heavy , and doesn 't absorb very well . If I happened to get too much , I couldn 't do anything else but to smear it out more to other areas of the face . There were some mornings I woke up and the skin underneath the eye lashes was so itchy , but I wasn 't 100 % sure if the eye cream causes it . Another lesson to learn from this product is that eye cream lasts very long because I use very little st a time , so I should never buy the jar package again as it 's not very sanitary over a long period of time . After 3 months and the jar was still almost full ! !####[([-1], [36, 40], 'POS'), ([-1], [43, 45], 'NEG'), ([48], [50], 'NEG'), ([48], [52], 'NEG'), ([48], [55, 59], 'NEG'), ([149, 150], [155, 163], 'NEG'), ([170], [172, 174], 'NEU')]####Luxury_Beauty

It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends ) way stronger and shinny without being oily ! It 's really fantastic .

I usually use natural skin care products as much as possible , but two weeks ago my dermatologist burned off some pre -cancerous areas on my hand , and she recommended that I get the Aquaphor "in a tub " to heal them . ( I couldn 't find any explanation online as to whether or not the tub version was different than the tube version , but figured I just buy this big tub since it was more cost -effective . ) Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon , I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas , which wasn 't really doing much . As soon as I started using the Aquaphor , I noticed a big difference in how my skin was healing . This tub is huge , especially since you only need a tiny bit of this . I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house . It seems to have a ton of uses ; I 've been applying it not only on those patches on my hand , but also on dry areas on my face (a result of using Carac cream to remove pre -cancerous patches also ) , on my lips , on my heels at night , and also on my cuticles .

After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor . Our family doesn 't floss much . The dentist castigated me for this and I said , "But I do floss ! Twice a year ! " (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth ) . The dentist and his hygienist were not amused . So , we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven 't changed dentists by then ! ) we will be able to tell them we do use it .

So yes the little bottle is $ 20 .00 however if you 're looking for relief from baby being at the breast , this little bottle is like gold for them . It goes such a long way . You don 't need much . It 's not greasy feeling like some lanolin can get . We have actually used in for our 8 month old through teething & rash . We 'd throw some on at bed & by morning good as new ! I highly highly recommend this to all new moms !####[([24, 25], [27, 28], 'POS'), ([-1], [33, 37], 'POS'), ([-1], [39, 43], 'POS'), ([-1], [47, 49], 'POS'), ([-1], [86, 88], 'POS')]####All_Beauty

I read that sponges need to be changed once a month . . . This product combines a body wash and sponge in one ! The skin feels so clean each time I used it ! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation . To prolong its life , I first wash my hair (my body gets wet ) turn off the water and scrub /soap -up my whole body with the Spongelle . Once done , I simply rinse off with the shower . This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle 's useful life -span . About a month and a half after first use , I start adding some of my favorite body wash . And after three months I replace it with a new one .####[([-1], [26, 29], 'POS'), ([38], [39, 43], 'POS'), ([96, 97], [95], 'POS')]####All_Beauty

Been using this for years . Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single . I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts , frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days . Don 't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone .####[([-1], [0, 4], 'POS'), ([-1], [6, 8], 'POS'), ([-1], [60, 65], 'NEG'), ([-1], [51, 55], 'NEG')]####All_Beauty
I decided to purchase this for my husband as part of a gift because I love the " Invigorating Tibetan " version of this and it 's every bit as gorgeous as the Tibetan shower gel but much milder and more on a light floral note whereas the Tibetan is more of a strong cologne scent . Very nice for baths before bedtime .####[([18, 19], [15], 'POS'), ([-1], [30], 'POS'), ([-1], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([-1], [43, 45], 'POS'), ([-1], [57, 58], 'POS')]####All_Beauty

This soap has a very pleasant smell , but most importantly it is very concentrated and so you don 't need to use as much soap ( saving you money and resources ) . I used this for medical reasons (jock itch ) and found that the tea tree solution helps . However Tea Tree is often very costly and to be able to buy this in bulk at such a good value . . . I would strongly recommend .####[([6], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([25], [13, 14], 'POS'), ([25], [27, 31], 'POS'), ([47, 49], [50], 'POS'), ([72], [71], 'POS'), ([-1], [78, 79], 'POS')]####All_Beauty

I 'm giving this three stars because it does work but the results do not justify the price . I 've been using this for over two months . Before I started I couldn 't even get my lashes on a curler . They were that short . Within two and a half weeks I could see a difference . Within a month I could get my lashes on a curler . This product did make my eyelids itchy . No irritation in my eye though when I accidentally got some in it . I also noticed a weird looking line above my lashes that is lighter than the rest of my skin . I 've used this as directed . I did see improvement but I think there is a natural plateau to the length and amount of eyelashes that one 's DNA will allow . I 've hit mine . Overall a good product but I can 't see spending the money on it again ( I got mine for 60 % off and still can 't justify it ) .####[([-1], [8, 9], 'POS'), ([-1], [4, 5], 'NEU'), ([-1], [12, 17], 'NEG'), ([73], [74, 78], 'NEG'), ([-1], [80, 84], 'POS'), ([-1], [122, 124], 'POS'), ([155], [154], 'POS'), ([155], [158, 163], 'NEG')]####All_Beauty

I continually get compliments on how wonderful I smell whenever I have used this product - especially when using it with the body lotion . I bought this product at Bath and Body during one of their annual sales a year ago and now they no longer carry it . However , other dealers have it online for $ 45 and the lotion for $ 45 up to 95 ?

This gel uses what feels like small seeds as the scrubbing particles . but there are too few of them to be of any real help as a body scrub . As a cranberry -scented , foaming body wash , it 's out of this world heavenly ! Just so luscious it makes me hungry just smelling it . It 's also thick and makes a LOT of lather with only a minor amount of the gel on a bath sponge .
