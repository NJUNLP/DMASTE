Dermatologists recommend a mineral sunscreen such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide . The older generation sunscreens with zinc oxide used to leave a thick white paste on the skin , similar to the look of diaper cream . Obagi Nu - Derm however has a thin , almost fluid consistency and just about disappears on the skin if you rub it in for about 10 seconds . There is a very faint powder scent . The special smooth zinc formula is called Z -COTE , a trademark of BASF Corp . This sunscreen is also great if you tend to have acne breakouts after wearing sunscreen , because zinc oxide is great at preventing acne . According to dermatologist Rebecca Tung , "Its main beneficial properties relative to the skin include being an antioxidant , as well as being anti -inflammatory and antimicrobial . Studies have suggested that zinc may reduce acne -causing bacteria counts , and that it may also reduce sebum and oil production .

My face is way too sensitive - it loves to make my life miserable with its "acne parties " . Most cleansers (esp foaming ) dry me out and lead to more acne . This smells so fresh and is fairly gentle (for me ) . Cleans my oily skin well , mildly chemically exfoliating . Once in a while I 'll just leave it on my face for 20 min before rinsing . For the first time in years my skin is clear and glowing - thanks to this product as well as others from MB . I like the toners , rose oil , rose spray . Don 't like the MB stuff specifically formulated for acne (not just MB I think all acne products are too aggravating ) .

2nd purchase . Great for medium to thick with tangley hair . Thin hair ? Spray in hands and use sparingly . Gets my knots manageable , nice smell . It actually sprays which is great because some kind of spit spray which is annoying . I use this mostly in the winter .

The Elta sunscreen products were recommended by my dermatologist . I chose this tinted one because I was hoping for a tiny bit of coverage to help even out my skin tone . Instead it went on practically clear and very shiny . I also wanted some sunscreen protection for the delicate eye area . I could not use this anywhere near my eyes because it burned like crazy and I had to wash it off after about 10 minutes . I tired it a second time and the same thing happened . Also I was disappointed when I read in the instructions that for it to be effective for sunscreen protection you need to reapply it every two hours .

I did not like this face wash and was pretty disappointed because I am a huge La Roche - Posay fan .

For starters this product definitely does everything everyone raves about . It is an excellent light coverage on my skin (which goes between fair and medium depending on how recently I self -tanned ) and blends in seemlessly . It seems to soak in well an dI 've never had problems with it running if I workout after applying . The reason for the 1 star reduction is that I think it feels a bit chalky , almost like there is flour in it .

My hair is naturally curly but has been thinning for several years . It finally reached a point where it was noticeable . Being a woman in the performing arts I realized I needed to take action before it became too obvious . I started to use Minoxidil , thickening shampoos , and hair vitamins . My hair is healthier and there are signs things might be getting better . However , the process takes too long so I wanted something in the meantime that I could use to help me regain my confidence . I found it in Toppik . So easy to use and the results are immediate . I even went out in windy weather and wasn 't afraid that my thin spots would show .

I don 't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better . I just completed my first shave and came away loving it .

This is an effective deep cleansing shampoo . With this shampoo I would really recommend that you first wash your hair with a cheaper shampoo then follow with this . I have found that on the first round of shampoo this does not lather well , so you 'll end up using more than you need if you want a rich lather .

This is a great CC cream for everyone , but most especially for those w / oily or combo skin . I 've tried lots of good CC creams , including the infamous beauty -blogger favorite by IT Cosmetics . . .which I do love , but you end up TOTALLY slick later in the day if you have an oily T -zone or combo skin . With Dr . T 's SuperGoop , my skin stays a bit more matte which makes touch -ups possible , rather than impossible as they mostly are w / the IT Cosmetics version (you can 't touch up a total oil slick ! ) . I am fair , however , I use the medium -dark and it 's fine - it provides me a bit of color without overdoing it . This product goes on easily , without being oily and without being tacky where it drags across your skin . I put some powder over it and my skin just looks flawless .

Love this stuff . I received a sample of the peach color and I don 't wear much peach but I liked it enough to try the pink . The color is light pink , almost like a soft pink -rose . If I put a thin coat on then it 's lighter and if I want slightly more pigment I use 2 coats . Feels great on my lips . I apply every few hours . This is not a thick lipstick and it 's not a gloss . It 's a sheer color that can deepen and slightly change after you put it on . Good for those who like lighter pinks . Goes very well with JI blush in : Cotton Candy and Awake - both of which I wear with this lipstick . Going to get the red next .

Pro : Whitens and brightens my natural nail tips . Looks really nice by itself . Con : Bright nail tips really show through color polish and look horrible . HORRIBLE . Pro : Quite a good basecoat - - keeps polish firmly in place and makes nails strong while in use . Con : It really doesn 't fill in ridges very well . It does make nails somewhat smoother but nothing to write home about . Additionally , my bottle is gloopy and it tends to pool on the sides , making my polish colors uneven .

I expected this to be a little better . I suppose I had high hopes based off my previous experiences with buying various products of this brand . The lotion smells good and mostly rosy at first , but then really dwindles down quickly to just a perfume smell and not like roses at all . All of the scent goes away rather quickly , though , too . The moisturization was not as much as I expected either . Usually Loccitane lotions and creams are very rich and long lasting on the skin . This one wasn 't like that , even my hands felt dry after just an hour or two , which is very unusual for the brand . I buy a lot of their body products , as well as face and eye creams . They 've always been very luxe feeling on the skin . . . very rich , very moisturizing , etc . I do realize this one is called a body milk , which typically does indicate a lighter lotion , but I guess I just didn 't expect it to be this light . I will use it up , but I will continue my search for a rose scented body cream or lotion . This bottle is very cute with a little gold colored flip top opening . It will be hard getting the lotion out once the bottle gets low .####[([-1], [1, 7], 'NEG'), ([29], [30, 31], 'POS'), ([-1], [33, 36], 'POS'), ([-1], [41, 48], 'NEG'), ([-1], [50, 54], 'NEG'), ([59], [60, 63], 'NEG'), ([70], [72, 77], 'NEG'), ([-1], [103, 112], 'NEG'), ([215], [217, 218], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

I was given the MD SolarSciences SPF 50 Tinted Beauty Balm in my Birchbox and I loved it . It absorbed well and you couldn 't really notice the tint ; I was able to wear an illuminating moisturizer over it without it feeling too heavy or greasy . The only reason I purchased this was because it was cheaper and the quantity was slightly more . I do like this although it is " slightly " more slippery . . . . . . It covers well , absorbs well (after about 5 minutes ) . If you don 't rub it in well , it can leave you looking white . I may go back to the tinted beauty balm : haven 't really decided . This doesn 't make me breakout and overall was a great purchase and I don 't regret it but if you tried the tinted beauty balm and expect this to be the same , it is not !

These are totally worth getting . Not only do you get a full credit to use on another product but what they give you lasts longer than it may appear at first . I am especially thrilled with the perfume samples , which are the little spray kinds and oh so handy for your purse or desk at work , or even your car . All pricey perfumes , no junk .

Like the color , but it does not go on as smoothly as expected as it is more of an opaque polish . I was not expecting that considering the color , the consistency of the polish is something would would expect from a solid pastel color or nude polish . It 's still a nice color , it just takes at least 3 coats and hard to work with , like many pastel colors , to get a solid looking finish .####[([2], [0], 'POS'), ([-1], [6, 13], 'NEG'), ([56], [53, 55], 'POS'), ([-1], [58, 64], 'NEG')]####Luxury_Beauty

white pencil is matte , not super creamy . stays on my water line all day .it fades a little but still visible by the end of the day . looks great with blue eyeshadows . easy to draw the line , i do 2 or 3 passes . it is not too soft so it doesn 't crumble , which is great , will last a long time . the color is true bright white .

I purchased some Replenix product samples from Amazon just to try this brand for the first time . It 's very hard to tell just from a sample if a retinoid based product works , but this serum has a good formula and few straightforward ingredients . The sample packet is quite generous , I spread it out even on my neck , shoulders and chest , not just my face . It 's a thick serum , with an earthy scent and an brownish orange color . Even if it 's thick , it was absorbed quick into the skin . After application my skin felt tight . I applied it under my eyes as well , no irritation occurred and I have sensitive eyes . I use retinoids 3 - 4 times a week already , so my skin is used to them . I followed with my moisturizer , even on my combination skin it didn 't provided enough hydration . My skin was plumper in the morning , but most good serum do that .####[([37], [40, 41], 'POS'), ([37], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([48, 49], [51, 52], 'POS'), ([76], [75], 'POS'), ([81], [80], 'NEU'), ([86], [84, 85], 'NEU'), ([-1], [96, 100], 'POS'), ([-1], [104, 107], 'POS'), ([-1], [118, 120], 'POS'), ([-1], [164, 170], 'NEG')]####Luxury_Beauty

It 's a very pretty color , and it has smooth application . I put 3 very thin coats on and my nails look flawless . In sunlight , the silver shimmer is very beautiful , but still subtle . It 's a very summery feminine polish . The color looks like a shimmery less pastel version of Coral Reef by Sally Hansen . I painted my nails with Sunday Funday last night and they haven 't chipped 24 hours later . Usually I chip polishes fast because my nails are in awful condition from school , work , guitar , and piano . But it 's held up so far with a top coat . Definitely in my top 5 favorite polishes out of the 50 -something I have . On a side note , the polish arrived very fast , a day before the shipment stated . The polish was properly wrapped in bubble wrap and then put into paper packaging that was encased with bubble wrap as well .####[([5], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([11], [10], 'POS'), ([-1], [22, 24], 'POS'), ([30, 31], [33, 34], 'POS'), ([30, 31], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([46], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([46], [45], 'POS'), ([49], [53], 'POS'), ([-1], [75, 80], 'POS'), ([-1], [107, 110], 'POS'), ([122], [119, 121], 'POS'), ([138], [139, 140], 'POS'), ([146], [142, 144], 'POS'), ([162], [165, 170], 'POS'), ([-1], [152, 156], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

I can remove everything on my face with one cotton round + a bit of this water . The little cotton round is filthy by the end . At first I didn 't use a cotton round . I would put some of this in my hands and massage it onto my face . I thought it would be a waste to put it on something - -that the something would absorb all the product . Rather , the waste was splashing this on my face . It says you don 't have to wash it off your skin , and sometimes I don 't . Sometimes I just splash my face once or twice after with some warm water . It 's a nice fast way to remove foundation , brow product , eye shadow + mascara . . .

I 've been a Lorac user for quite some time , and recently decided to try their matte eyeshadow . The only negative is the pallette does not include an applicator brush , which it should .

I LOVE this stuff I mean it has finally set me free from having to shower EVERY morning . Let me stress that I have tried so many other dry shampoos and it did not help or made my hair feel gross . I bought this the first time to give a try when I was traveling for almost 24hrs my hair would get so oily and a little bit of this was all I needed . I have dark hair and the powder is white so yes if you use a lot you can see it a little bit , however if you take a few min to work it in you cant see it anymore ! It is a little pricey but for me it is well worth it , I NEVERRRR thought I would be able to go a day or 2 without washing my hair and looking disgusting and was so jealous of all my friends who were able to do that but now I can ! Saves me so much time in the morning not having to blow dry and style every day . It 's a really light weight powder and almost has a bit of grit in the powder which makes my hair feel clean and freshened while giving it lift . In my opinion this is what makes it better then any other because it does more then soak up oil .####[([3], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([3], [9, 17], 'POS'), ([-1], [73, 75], 'POS'), ([-1], [120, 122], 'NEG'), ([-1], [171, 175], 'POS'), ([195], [192, 194], 'POS'), ([205], [198, 203], 'POS'), ([200, 202], [207, 213], 'POS'), ([-1], [233, 238], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

I have recently started using this BB cream and I really like it . It makes my skin look much better very even and smooth , plus it feels incredibly light and silky going on . Most impressively , it really blends away your pores somehow . It only comes in two shades Fair / Light and Light /Medium . I bought the Light /Medium although I am pretty fair and it blends in perfectly . The only drawback is that it does not seem to absorb any oil despite the description and needs to be set with powder . In fact , Effaclar is La Roch e -Posays acne line but this is not at all drying .

These wipes are great . They are soft , gentle and have a very mild baby scent . After my daughter would finish eating , I would wipe her face with other wipes and her face started drying it so much . I ended up switching to these wipes and her face no longer is dry and is nice and soft . They are definitely expensive so I wouldn 't really use them as regular wipes past the first couple of weeks of a baby 's life . I used these in between baths when she was really tiny to freshen her up and they worked wonderfully for that purpose too . We always have these wipes in the house and the only reason I am taking off a star is that I would love for it to come with the snap top like the picture but it comes with an adhesive top that doesn 't really work great at keeping shut .

I have literally been on a retinol for 30 years ! !

My acne has since gotten much better but I remain on a retinol for its anti -aging benefits . I find this product to be very good . There are different levels so if you have not used a retinol you may want to step down and use the .25 or .50 and work your way up .

There are lots of retinol products on the market anymore but I think for the price point and quality of this particular one you simply can 't beat it .

I 'd been looking for a scented candle with some serious fragrance heft ; a great throw to really add to my whole (small ) house . This does the trick . It burns cleanly and has a clean , crisp scent . There are light floral overtones but "champagne " would not be far off . The candle comes in a hefty presentation box that I 'd be proud to give as a gift for a shower or celebratory event . The glass container , usually a throw away in items like this , is really special . I very much want to keep it for household use after the candle is done . Pretty with an artisan flair . I want to add a note : the instructions say to burn the candle to the edge the first time you light it as that will afford a smooth burn all the way down . The estimated time to get to that stage was given as 2 - 3 hours . I have had this candle burning for 5 hours and cannot get that full circumferential burn . It doesn 't diminish the candle for me but I did want to point that out .

Application is the same as any other nail polish , the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me ( I am VERY hard on my nails ) .

I REALLY liked the color Cake Pop ( I got some compliments ) but it was thin - I needed 3 coats for good coverage . It wore about the same as OPI for staying power and chips .

7 / 22 /2015 I 'm so pleased with this product , I bought a tube . The original tube lasted one year . I 've been using wrinkle /fine line reducer products for a couple of years now , so I didn 't expect that the StriVectin would be able to make anymore of a difference , but it did . It has worked particularly well on my neck and forehead wrinkles , making them much less noticeable . The lines around my eyes have also improved . I expect that if I hadn 't already been using other products , there would have been a greater improvement . I like that this product has no artificial color or added fragrance . It does have a bit of a minty smell , but it 's hardly noticeable and dissipates quickly . Even though it 's pricey , a little goes a long way , so this lasts quite a while .####[([10], [6, 8], 'POS'), ([-1], [64, 71], 'POS'), ([-1], [81, 87], 'POS'), ([114], [111], 'POS'), ([114], [115, 121], 'POS'), ([130, 131], [125, 128], 'NEU'), ([130, 131], [136, 137], 'NEU'), ([130, 131], [139, 140], 'POS'), ([-1], [146], 'NEU'), ([-1], [157, 160], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

I absolutely LOVE Vinylux because it does exactly what it says it does - lasts for a week . I always precede it with OPI BondAid and then finish with Vinylux Top Coat . However , this looks absolutely pink which is what I wanted . It isn 't anywhere near pink , not in the vicinity of pink , and not even a nodding acquaintance with pink . It 's a dusky transparent lilac . If you want it to be opaque , coat your nails three times and it looks great . But it 's not pink ! I want pink ! I 'm keeping this however , b /c I was going to look for a shade like it soon anyway . It does last a week , and it looks beautiful .

First of all , let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff . I gave this 3 stars because IMHO , it doesn 't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes . I have a tube of Proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave . Also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather . I did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 -step process which I don 't want to do . I 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl . And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in -between . It 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream . It 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you wouldn 't need to wipe any residue off your hand .####[([11], [10], 'POS'), ([-1], [17, 18], 'NEU'), ([-1], [23, 27], 'NEG'), ([-1], [119, 121], 'POS'), ([128, 130], [133, 137], 'NEG'), ([-1], [198, 201], 'POS'), ([-1], [185, 191], 'POS'), ([-1], [205, 207], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

I recently got the worst adult acne on my back and face I have ever had . I apply this with a Q - Tip on the affected areas after either I tone with pure rubbing alcohol or witch hazel . (Usually back , chest and cheeks ) , wait 15 minutes naked then put on my pajamas and go to bed . The smell is pretty bad and my room has this smell lingering but who cares ! This really dries out active pimples and "opens up " under the skin cysts . I have noticed even when I use a little bit on a pimple not only will that pimple go down , but the surrounding areas will break out less often . Maybe it 's killing the bacteria that spreads and causes more acne ? Either way it 's DEFINITELY not a cure -all or even an overnight cure but it is consistently effective in reducing bumps and pimples and when you 're dealing with an all out attack , this helps tremendously . My only complaint is that it goes by WAAAY too fast and I have a ton of the pink stuff left at the bottom of the bottle but none of the alcohol liquid that sits on top of it . (So I have squired witch hazel and rubbing alcohol in it to make it last , it still seems to work this way ) I just ordered my second bottle .####[([64], [66, 67], 'NEG'), ([64], [74], 'NEU'), ([-1], [80, 84], 'POS'), ([-1], [86, 92], 'NEU'), ([-1], [111, 113], 'POS'), ([-1], [117, 123], 'POS'), ([-1], [142, 146], 'NEU'), ([-1], [155, 161], 'POS'), ([-1], [174, 175], 'POS'), ([-1], [183, 187], 'NEG')]####Luxury_Beauty

I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves . I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know . As a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice . It loads well , though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones . The scent is nice and has some staying power . The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion . Is this the best soap in the world ? Nope . Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point ? Absolutely . One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave . Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso . This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin . ) Let me just say a preshave is a must . I use an oil but you could use theirs as well . A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better . without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti -inflammatory properties .####[([35, 37], [40, 42], 'POS'), ([53], [54, 60], 'POS'), ([45], [46], 'POS'), ([63], [65, 70], 'POS'), ([73], [76], 'NEU'), ([99], [101, 107], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

Good Stuff ! When I first got into DE shaving I tried all kinds of Esoteric shave creams , soap etc . After the dust settled and my wallet was empty I found the Proraso Shave Soaps . I find with a good badger brush and possibly a drop of shave oil this soap is all one needs for the PERFECT close shave ! I like the green Proraso sometimes a bit better than this white and sometimes I prefer this white so I keep both on hand and alternate . I find the value of this product is simply incredible . With a badger brush I get fantastic , PERFECT lather and this product last many months before I need to order more . I find using one drop of Shave Secret oil in my mix is preferred but not required to get that perfect shave ! I like the built in cup as I shave in the shower and with this plastic (unbreakable ) cup I can whip up a good later in no time .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [42], 'POS'), ([67, 68], [65], 'POS'), ([-1], [71, 75], 'POS'), ([81], [79], 'POS'), ([94], [99, 100], 'POS'), ([111], [108], 'POS'), ([111], [110], 'POS'), ([114], [115, 117], 'POS'), ([151, 153], [149], 'POS'), ([173], [172], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty

jane iredale lip pencils break easily and have to be ground down quite a bit each time they need to be sharpened . I have found this to be true of every lip pencil I have bought in this line of cosmetics . For that reason , the lip pencils are way over -priced .

My skin gets dry and easily irritated , especially on my back and underarms . This cleansing bar is like magic . I have only been using it for two days and have already gotten relief from itchy and dry skin . After a shower , my skin no longer feels tight and itchy - it 's softer and smoother so that I don 't feel the need to use body lotion . Also , it 's gentle enough that I can use it lightly to cleanse my face without causing irritation or tightness . This is an absolutely excellent cleansing bar , a tad expensive compared to others but worth every penny that I paid for it .

I have very sensitive skin . Over the years I have tried many different things to help . This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing . The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent . This was good for me as I also don 't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells . This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint . The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously . I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor . Although my skin hasn 't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years . I am very happy with this purchase .####[([-1], [32, 35], 'POS'), ([38], [39, 43], 'POS'), ([50], [45, 49], 'POS'), ([-1], [54], 'POS'), ([78], [77], 'POS'), ([78], [80, 81], 'POS'), ([90], [92, 95], 'POS'), ([142], [138, 140], 'POS')]####Luxury_Beauty
After many years of dreading shaving I decided to start using a straight razor . Wish I had gone this route years ago . My shave is now a ritual . I love to shave now . I love the feel and weight of the razor and the skill it takes to produce a smooth shave . One of the problems I was having was finding the right soap . I read many reviews and besides wool fat soap , the Proraso comes out on top . I tried it , I love , love , love it . Smooth , silky , great lather . Buying this proves you don 't have to spend a fortune to become a wet shaver . you can buy a fine , shave ready razor , a nice badger brush and this great Proraso Soap , right here on Amazon ! If you have never had a straight shave , get one ! Then get a nice razor .

ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer . I have been eyeing it out for a while but was not wanting to pay $ 60 for a a hair dryer . Then after a few week of debate I decided to get it after all . It arrived yesterday and I could not wait and tried it on . OMG ! This is the lightest BIG hair dryer I have ever owned . It feels GREAT in hand . Also 2000 watts is JUST what I needed for my thick , long and curly hair . Usually It takes me about an hour to blowdry and then another hour to straighten my hair but with this hair dryer I had nicely dried and styled my hair in 30 minutes ! And the best part is I did not need to use a flat iron ! My hair is super soft and I love how quickly I was able to accomplish what usually takes me almost to hours !

This lip balm is a bit pricey compared to your regular every day Chapstick or Blistex tubed lip balms , but it is very good lip balm and worth the price . It heals and soothes chapped or dry lips quickly . Moisturization lasts , so you don 't have to apply it constantly . All 3 varieties are good , but I think this one is best for healing really chapped lips . Consistency isn 't too thick or shiny . It won 't make a man look like he is wearing lip gloss . I 've been buying these for my son and husband for a few years now . They are always happy to receive them .

I came across "Mario Badescu " at ULTA one day at the checkout area . I picked up the rose water /aloe facial spray and fell in love .

Although it does not seem to be helping my dark under eye circles . It is also a little thick , so I recommend applying a thin layer 10 - 15min before makeup application .

good toothpaste but way more mint than ginger flavored .

I have fine hair that 's oily at the crown and very dry brittle ends . A year ago my stylist recommended the HBL products . Now I can 't live without them ! I use hydrating shampoo and the hair masque . Only a small dab needed . The higher cost is made up for in value of the product . I occasionally change up shampoo by using the HBL volumizing shampoo . With the hydrating I wash hair more quickly as it is rich but never leaves hair oily . With the masque . . . I do use daily but I apply first at the brittle ends and then work up from there . . . .basically only using the remaining residuals of the shampoo on my crown . After washing I towel dry and after it begins to dry I then work into the dry ends , a pea sized amount of the HBL Shine and Seal . Any residual on finger tips is lightly applied to areas with fly aways . My hair looks healthy and naturally shiny !

Dove no longer manufactures this body wash so I was relieved to find it on Amazon . The price is ridiculous but since I could not find it anywhere else I bought it . This is the only body wash I can use that doesn 't dry my skin and make me itchy .

Hi reader , I have used this product since the early 60s and nothing has changed . It makes the electric razor glide across the skin without dragging . It seems to set -up the beard better than any other way . Now I 'm sure some company has copied it somehow , but I like the clean smell and how it works , so I don 't look for any other stuff . Great Product !####[([7], [13, 15], 'POS'), ([-1], [18, 27], 'POS'), ([-1], [32, 36], 'POS'), ([58], [57], 'POS'), ([60, 62], [55], 'POS'), ([-1], [66, 72], 'POS'), ([75], [74], 'POS')]####All_Beauty

I was skeptical about ordering this lotion because I didn 't think it would smell like the actual perfume . WRONG ! ! It smells exactly like the Original J ' Adore perfume .
