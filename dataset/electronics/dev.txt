I have been plagued with very dirty power for years . After doing a great deal of research , as I would suggest anyone do before buying almost anything , I settled on The Monster MP HT800 . I 'm using it mainly for audio recording , Voice Over work to be exact , where a clean signal is a must . Hooked up my computer , mixing board and amp to this , and right away , the low frequency hum , I 've had to pad out , went away . Bought two now , and in the crowded urban environment of LA , I finally have clean sounding power . This is no hype , just the facts . I know some reviewers don 't notice a difference , well they probably have less noise to filter out . Hope the surge protection is as good as the filtering . Price was right on Amazon as well . I think I 'll get a third for the home theater .####[([-1], [107, 111], 'POS'), ([153], [155], 'POS')]####Electronics

For some reason , if you by this type of cable at local stores they will cost several times more than you 'll pay at Amazon . Instead of using a network connector , I hook up my two computers with one of these cables each .

I have no horror stories about lightning strikes or major power surges to tell . This does the job that I need , but do not think it has been truly tested . I have 3 of these for various setups . There was a TV that would occasionaly just have sound no picture . Replacing the surge protector with the monster model seems to have elimated the problem .

I am using the Isobar 8 outlet unit with 8 ' cord with my audio /video system . I am familiar with their products . They provide the protection as advertised . The protection indicator on my 8 outlet unit is clearly visible , as it sits on the floor in my media room . I always know when it is functioning . However , with this direct plug -in unit , it is buried behind my heavy , new LG refrig (as I suspect other users will too ) and impossible to see if protection is active . If the unit gets taken out by a surge (as it should ) you would never know because you can not see the light on this unit . I think it might still operate without the active protection . That would be crazy . Some sort of audible warning sound would . correct this situation .

I used to buy these headphones regularly when they were $ 10 -12 bucks a pair . With the infiltration of other more expensive headphones Sony somehow thought they could charge 1000 % more for these . They are a decent headphone for what I used them for - throwing them into my gym bag and running with them . The reason I bought them is because I would go through 2 -3 pair a year because they would break easily (the cord and connectivity to the head piece will go quickly ) and I wouldn 't feel bad constantly replacing them because I like the over the head model for running and use ear buds for just listening to music . I am shocked an annoyed that Sony thinks they could get $100 bucks for these .

Coupled with a 25 -ft cord , Y -splitter and 2 sets of headphones , this is a good way for 2 people to listen to TV or play video games after the rest of the house has gone to bed .

A convenience is the switch , the sockets are too close together to plug in 3 or more adapter type plugs . It was larger than I expected , the picture makes it look smaller than it is , also it didn 't have a flat bottom surface but instead had two mounting rails for mounting to a surface . It can and does remain sitting on the carpet and I would recommend if on hard woods that something be placed on it (ie : silicon spots , felt spots ) or under it like a pad to protect floors from any type of scratching . Overall the product offers a nice 6 foot chord so combined with the switch it does not necessarily need to sit under something such as a desk , as long as a wall socket is 6 feet or under , allowing for play needed for the intended use . ( As an example if you plan to mount it two feet from the floor with 1 /2 foot of travel under furniture , be certain the wall socket is within 3 1 /2 feet . of your mounting location . )####[([4], [1], 'POS'), ([-1], [24], 'NEG'), ([-1], [41, 47], 'NEG'), ([112, 114], [111], 'POS')]####Electronics

I love these headphones . The passive noise cancellation is great due to the very large over -the -ear muffs on these puppies .

My primary reason for buying these was I need an inexpensive headphone for my kids to use on long trips for listening to music and watching movies .

The guitar came well boxed and padded with brown paper . Unfortunately there was no receipt included which I would need for warranty work . I called Customer Service and they just sent me a copy of an email that they sent me for the purchase . If anything goes wrong with the guitar and I would need warranty work , I 'm not sure that a copy of email would satisfy the need of a receipt . As far as the guitar , it is an excellent alternative to a full size guitar when you are unable to bring a full size one . But this is not a good substitue to a conventional guitar . The fit and finish are spectacular to say the least . The electronics work flawlessly . The sound is very good . The included stethescope earphone is uncomfortable to wear and most headphone amps will not fit into the cable jack due to its location . As far as playability , it is strange for my right hand .

You will be hard pressed to find a colored TRS to TRS cable anywhere for a price this low . That said , one of my cables was f aulty out of the package . It was missing the clear plastic insulating tube that the other cables have on each end . My advice to you , check and make sure the plastic insulator is on each end of each cable before using , and if it is missing , cover the soldered connections with electrical tape .

My HoneyTone arrived yesterday . I bought it for a giggle , because for $ 20 why not ? Pulled it out of the box and admired its face , right out of a '55 Chevy BelAir , then popped the battery lid and was amused by the custom -labelled 9v . Can I buy more of those ? I wasn 't prepared for what happened when I plugged it in : It sounds . . . GOOD . I mean , really good ! And loud enough to annoy my family , so that 's a win . I put on some headphones and enjoyed the sounds for a bit , then grabbed a patch cord and plugged it into my laptop running Guitarix . Oh , man , this toy will run Guitarix !

I 've used other manufacturer 's guitar strings , even the brands that has their special string coatings to prevent corrosion , but they all fail when compared to SIT strings . I like the bright tone , which is clear and they actually stay in tune - just as the product name suggests . A real plus for me , is that these strings don 't tarnish as quickly as the other brands I 've used . Tarnish strings deadens the tone , which also affects the intonation . Because I play my guitar somewhere , every weekend - my sweaty hands just reeks havoc and quick corrode my strings . I can go through two to three sets of strings per month ! . SIT strings actually saves me money per month . Now SIT allows me to play a set per month . I probably can do a month in half , but I a stickler about my tone and intonation , so I don 't want to push the strings too much . If you haven 't tried this brand on your guitar yet , I suggest you give them a try .####[([35, 36], [33], 'POS'), ([35, 36], [40], 'POS'), ([-1], [43, 46], 'POS'), ([64], [65, 69], 'POS'), ([126, 127], [129, 131], 'POS'), ([-1], [190, 192], 'POS')]####Musical_Instruments
Does the job . Can it be used for chapped lips ? - -you decide . The applicator is much more convenient that the cork grease that comes in a tiny lozenge shaped container .

Otterbox has become a trusted name for mobile phone cases - but I was hesitant to purchase this case for my Nokia E5 fearing that it would inhibit my access to the keys of the phone . My other concern was that it would add too much bulk . Both of these fears seemed unwarranted because after receiving the Commuter series case , I have had totally free access to all keys , and a very minimal increase in the bulk of the phone . What a great case ! I would recommend this over the "Impact " series case . The 2 -component soft /hard case protects against damage while still keeping the phone easy to get in and out of my pocket . The soft part of the case that is visible at the front of the phone is beveled , allowing easy access to the keys . All in all , this case is a great buy and I recommend it to anyone wondering how to best protect their Nokia E5 .####[([-1], [75, 80], 'POS'), ([88], [87], 'POS'), ([-1], [91, 92], 'POS'), ([102, 106], [107, 109], 'POS'), ([126, 127], [141], 'POS'), ([126, 127], [143, 148], 'POS'), ([155], [158, 159], 'POS'), ([-1], [64, 71], 'POS'), ([-1], [162], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories
