I tried the privacy screen for a 24 " widescreen LED monitor and the " privacy " feature made the screen dark at the right and left edges even when viewed straight on by one user . You need to back up to a distance of almost three feet to eliminate the darkness . It seems pretty clear that the product is not compatible with larger wide screens .

I like these headphones a lot . It 's been years since I 've had over -the -ear headphones and there 's no comparison in both comfort and sound vs earbuds . These are like being in concert . The MDR - V6 's have a nice , neutral sound , meaning they 're not overly base heavy but more realistic to what natural sound would be . The cord is coiled and doesn 't detach from the headset . So for those who want everything to come apart these wouldn 't do it .

Analog Portable shortwave radios are hard to come by these days . This is one of the few left that are being sold today . It 's not the highest quality , but it 's not junk either .

Not sure it would be good for more than one body although two with limited lenses could fit . If you have a Battery Grip Extension on your body then it takes up a bit more space .

Fits a Camera Body , 3 lens , three filter sets , chargers , batterys , flash , and assorted other items with ease . . . plenty of space to add other items within reason .

It 's a bit annoying when you buy something as a gift and the gift receiver has to later tell you that there was a part missing .

Instruction book was easy to review and within 30 minutes I was up and running . I have it connected to a 11 meter whip antenna so am hearing some good dx signals .

These are the best strings on the market . i have tried others and they have all come up short .

Bottom line : Ill keep it in a guitar case and use only if I don 't have separate tools handy . Its okay . I thought having this three -in -one tool would be handy to keep in a guitar case for emergencies ; however , its not super practical for regular use . The string cutting handle gets in the way of the winding tuning pegs , the cutting is okay ( Im not confident it will last long ) , and the acoustic puller is okay in a pinch . Youre better served buying the tree separate tools , but its likely more practical to keep only this doo -hickey in a guitar case . Wire cutters are cheap at dollar stores , string winders are often on counters at guitar shops as cheap impulse buy items , and everyone should have a decent pair of needle nose pliers to GENTLY pull pins (or wrap a pair of pliers with a sliver of electric tape to prevent teeth marks ) .####[([-1], [23], 'NEU'), ([-1], [48, 53], 'NEG'), ([56, 58], [59, 67], 'NEG'), ([70], [72], 'NEU'), ([85, 86], [88, 91], 'NEU'), ([111, 112], [104, 108], 'POS')]####Musical_Instruments
Quite simply stated , this is a very high quality microphone . It has a very rugged build . The sound pickup on this mic is so good that it can be used for many tasks . My very best advice is to just purchase this mic ( OR the Shure SM58 non -switched ) and do not waste your hard earned money on cheaper dynamic or condenser mics just to save a few bucks . The sensitivity of this mic is just incredible as the tech specs clearly point out . The cross platform uses for this particular mic are quite extensive to say the very least .####[([10], [7, 9], 'POS'), ([17], [15, 16], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [26, 27], 'POS'), ([77], [83], 'POS'), ([46], [44], 'POS')]####Musical_Instruments

I used the second tier to add to a cheap folding X -stand that came with my son 's keyboard . It works very well and is quite sturdy . The only item of note has been mentioned and I will add emphasis . If you have a shallow keyboard on the bottom , the upper board may get in the way . I have a Roland VR - 09 on the bottom with a KingKorg on top . The Roland is quite small (shallow ) and I 'd prefer that the Korg sit back a couple of inches , but there is no adjustment that will allow the position of the top board to be anything other than tilted . However , there is just enough visibility as to where this isn 't really a problem . This unit does what it is intended to do .

I wanted a compressor primarily for bass to take the edge off the occasional excessive transient and smoothen up the tone . Well you shouldn 't expect magic from a compressor , of course , but I was pretty underwhelmed by this one . The effect is very subtle (or nonexistent ) , then as you turn it up it suddenly kicks in with a rather unpleasant effect . To my ears it works better on guitar , but again I find the compression extremely abrupt when it kicks in and very audible , not in a good way . I was much more pleased with my TC Electronics rack compressor which I put in the effects loop of my bass amp . That has a much more subtle effect + you get a noise gate as well (and two channels too ! ) and a lot more versatility for pretty much the same price .####[([30], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([45], [47, 50], 'POS'), ([67], [66], 'NEG'), ([73], [74, 76], 'POS'), ([83], [84, 88], 'NEG'), ([83], [91, 98], 'NEG'), ([83], [91, 92], 'NEG')]####Musical_Instruments

I don 't know if Levy 's markets this as a bass guitar strap or a regular guitar strap . Whatever they are calling it , it works great on heavier guitars . I previously used a plain unpadded strap on Gretsch 5620 CB - T and the strap would dig into my shoulder after a few minutes of playing , even while sitting down . No more , this strap is much more comfortable . Standing up , it also seems to make the guitar feel a bit lighter and makes me forget it weighs about 10lbs . Perhaps this is because the wide strap distributes the weight of the guitar better than a 2 ' ' one , I 'm not sure . If you have a heavy guitar that is giving you issues and you 're still using it with a cheap , unpadded strap , give this a shot .####[([27], [28], 'POS'), ([70], [72, 74], 'POS'), ([-1], [149, 152], 'POS'), ([-1], [83, 89], 'POS')]####Musical_Instruments

I use three of these to help mic my drum kit . I mount them low onto cymbal stands (to reduce vibration from hitting the cymbals ) and they hold the mics in place well .

Ten years ago I had a SKB case which was sold with an older Bass I had . I must say the the quality of that case was better than the quality of this current rendition of the model /case . But . . . This model will protect the instrument as much as it can for a semi -reasonable price . Given the quality of the hardware and the ease in which these are produced I think they should be priced at about $ 50 (USD ) . The current price is a little bit too high (IMHO ) .

Well , I have to say that these strings have seen me through the last 9 months better than any string "deal " that I have tried before ! The strings stay lively for a long time with moderate playing time . I don 't play out that often , so the strings have been mostly used for rehearsing /wood shedding , but on the occasion that a gig came up and I had to play in a day or less , I was never afraid of dead strings after the first time !

This product came in a very small grey bottle . When opened it came out as semi -liquid . I followed the instructions on autogeek .net for how to apply this and it worked like a charm . First coat of the Klass All In One , then layered two coats of this product . Be very careful when dispense it onto your applicator . It 's VERY concentrated and a little goes a long way . If you get carried away , or accidentally use too much you will regret your aching arms later as it 's hard to get off and polish to a nice shine without it being streaky . Also be forewarned , don 't set this bottle on top of your car or on anything other than a porous , level surface . I learned the hard way that once it 's applied and buffed off the roof of your car , the bottle will slide on the sealed surface and eventually tip over . This stuff will make your paint slick , soft as silk , and give it a deep wet -looking shine . Better than most waxes I 've used even . The bottle looks a bit deceiving , it 's well designed but much smaller than I thought it would be . Overall an excellent product . Hard to buff off , and don 't use too much .####[([8], [5, 6], 'NEU'), ([-1], [33, 36], 'POS'), ([-1], [67, 68], 'NEU'), ([-1], [70, 75], 'POS'), ([-1], [89, 94], 'NEG'), ([-1], [98, 103], 'NEG'), ([-1], [111], 'NEG'), ([171], [172, 176], 'POS'), ([-1], [178, 180], 'POS'), ([189], [186, 188], 'POS'), ([-1], [191, 193], 'POS'), ([201], [202, 205], 'NEG'), ([-1], [209, 210], 'POS'), ([-1], [212, 216], 'NEU'), ([224], [223], 'POS'), ([-1], [226, 229], 'NEG')]####Automotive

This tool is a necessary one for removing the crank bolt on hondas . There are many videos online of how to do it . The thing i didn 't like and something i read from another buyer is that : When using this tool , the 50mm 6 sided grove has some tapered edges on the deep side of the harmonic balancer . The tool weighs a few pounds and when you place it inside the indention , it doesnt really sit flush and can fall out easily . Im not sure if other hondas /acuras have the same thing but it has a tendency to fall out when using it . . If they compensated for the round edges it may have fit a little better . The tool is square making it once again not super flush with the inside of the balancer . Another idea is making it magnetic so it doesnt fall out . Otherwise it was a good tool and got the job done .

Works for what I need it for . I have two trailers . One with a six -round and one with a 5 round . The adapter fits perfect in the 7 flat on all my trucks but it is only a 6 flat .

This is a yellow paste wax that came with a sponge applicator pad . I was skeptical that this could really out -do my old standby turtle wax so I did a side -by -side comparison on the hood of my 2011 metalic black VW GTI . After a wash and glaze treatment I applied half turtle wax and half Meguiar 's # 26 . They both applied the same and the Meguiar 's was a little easier to buff off . Initially there was no noticable difference between the two . Then a couple of days later , after a little rain and pollen accumulation I noticed that the Meguiar 's side still looked brilliant while the turtle wax side looked like a waxed car that had dried pollen stuck to it . The verdict is still out on how long a coat will last but with the ease of removal and the general sheen , I 'm happy to keep using this on my cars .####[([10, 12], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([72, 73], [75, 80], 'POS'), ([-1], [159, 162], 'POS')]####Automotive

I bought two of them . They do NOT come as a pair as one reviewer suggested . They are sold as EACH . I just lost one of them May 2015 , they were purchased Aug of 2014 . Used them several times , but it just fell off . They do whistle , but I think it is depends on the angle . I have not quite figured it out exactly . I like the idea of how they mount and are aero dynamic . Don 't expect to see a huge image , but enough to make you feel comfortable if the lane is clear . One of the things I did was label one of them as "Driver " so I know which side it goes on , and paid attention where two of the three points made contact with my vehicles mirror . This will require minor adjustments if any . I have contacted the company and shown them proof of purchase and see how they respond to it falling off . Would I buy it again ? Yes I would .

This phone WOULD receive a five -star rating if it wasn 't for the fact that it broke after seven months of light use . It will not register a cell phone signal matter what SIM card is used even in places with a strong signal on an identical phone on the same carrier .

The two little plastic pieces that support your device at the bottom edge are just that : two narrow pieces of plastic sticking out of an otherwise durable looking mount . Unfortunately , those little plastic pieces are very fragile and break off easily . One was broken off of the unit I received in the mail , most likely the results of damage during shipping .

This phone is OK . Like most feature phones , it has a great battery life , but the screen is l ow res and the 2mp camera takes pretty bad photos .

I purchased this bracket for my iPhone4 and am very pleased overall with it performance and high quality . The bracket , suction cup and extension arm is high quality and I doubt there will be any issues with it failing anytime soon . My one disappointment is that it does shake a bit while driving ( 2008 F150 ) and when using something like a GPS app it can e difficult to read the shaking screen . After using this for about a month though , I strongly doubt that any flexible arm extension would not shake some and I believe that this is the best solution one would find before moving to some firm fixed bracket device . Just a note . . .I ended up putting a little rubber bumper between the halfway point of the arm and the phone holder . The way I have mine mounted it passes an inch or so over the edge of my dash and this adds a bit more stability to the phone .####[([14], [9, 10], 'POS'), ([17], [16], 'POS'), ([17], [9, 10], 'POS'), ([20], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([22, 23], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([-1], [51, 58], 'NEG')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

I purchased this cable for the sole purpose of using it to connect my iPhone 4S to my aviation headset (for GPS , maybe a call and for occasional music ) . I was VERY surprised and pleasantly shocked when I opened the package (which arrived ahead of schedule ) . Man , this cable is THICK ! ! !

I bought this because cell phone signal was bad . This works great for one room . I upgraded to larger one . But if you have small house or just service bad in part of house this should work for you . Trust me it works .####[([-1], [11, 12], 'POS'), ([-1], [46], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

My OEM battery start to last shorter and shorter on each charge after barely 1 year of use , so I was looking for replacement battery . I was hoping to get an aftermarket high capacity replacement , but the risk there is most aftermarket ones have false capacity claims and can 't deliver . Decided to try Anker product because of all the great reviews . and Wow , am I happy . I can go through a day without recharge now , and it definitely last longer than my OEM . It 's heavy , which to a battery is a good thing , and it 's well built . If only Samsung would have included these batteries in the package . Recommend to anyone .####[([-1], [68], 'POS'), ([-1], [70, 72], 'POS'), ([-1], [75, 81], 'POS'), ([-1], [86, 91], 'POS'), ([-1], [95], 'POS'), ([-1], [109, 110], 'POS'), ([-1], [124], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

Let me start by saying ! The numbers and alphabet is extremely tiny on this Tracfone so if you wear glasses do not even attempt to buy this phone ! I truly can not believe how small Lg made the numbers So I gave this phone to my friends teenage daughter and it is the perfect phone for a teenager girl or boy ! But I will tell you this the prepaid cards you buy for this phone are cheaper than any of the others out there . Well worth it for your kids but not for adults at all and yes this seller was professional and on time . Thank You KC .####[([7], [11, 12], 'NEG'), ([9], [11, 12], 'NEG'), ([28], [17, 26], 'NEG'), ([40], [36], 'NEG'), ([56], [55], 'POS'), ([-1], [88, 93], 'POS'), ([-1], [95, 97], 'NEG'), ([103], [105], 'POS'), ([103], [107, 108], 'POS'), ([-1], [110, 111], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

These work great , they cover a lot and there are minimal bubbles . If you mess up you can just keep doing it until you get it right as they are not permanent .

I am using this in an Optimus V , and compared to the stock battery , I am getting about twice as much use from the battery - about 2 days of light to moderate use . Good price .####[([38], [37], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories
It 's a very pretty case and works well to protect the phone . . . but it 's VERY VERY hard to take off the cover if you need to do anything with the phone .

Received promptly . As others have noted plastic smoother not included but credit card works fine . Protectors are cut slightly larger than size of screen area to be covered resulting in bubbles near edges that can not be removed . Bubbles are also difficult to remove from central areas if protector is not carefully applied . Directions are ok and give good guidance in application technique . Bubbles and other imperfections are generally not visible when display is illuminated but really stand out when back light is off . Protector seems reasonably thick and performs intended function . Overall not a bad product . Will probably continue to use for exterior screen which receives the most abuse .####[([0], [1], 'POS'), ([7, 8], [9, 10], 'NEU'), ([17], [19, 26], 'NEG'), ([41], [44, 49], 'NEG'), ([57], [59], 'NEU'), ([57], [62, 66], 'POS'), ([68], [82, 88], 'NEG'), ([90], [92, 93], 'POS'), ([90], [95, 97], 'NEU'), ([103], [100, 102], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

I bought this because I do a a lot of travel to remote locations in the US . I have Sprint which I usually get OK service . I had 0 and still had 0 signal but everyone else was happy . Left it on job site for everyone to use and bought another for my next job site . Still 0 bars FML Texas is not Sprint country .####[([35], [29, 34], 'NEG'), ([-1], [37, 40], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories
I purchased this and a variety of common phone charging cables for our first -out engine and it is working great . Since we all rely on our phones for everything these days (we even get emergency dispatch information and updates on our cell phones ) , and sometimes we can be out on fire /rescue calls for hours , either one long emergency or back to back calls , this was a very inexpensive solution to keep our firefighters connected . Having the center 12V socket was the best option . We have been using this for over a month now and absolutely no complaints .####[([-1], [19, 20], 'POS'), ([-1], [73, 74], 'POS'), ([84, 86], [89, 90], 'POS'), ([-1], [103, 105], 'POS')]####Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

I have had a few of these battery packs , but wanted one that was not plastic . It fit 's better than plastic ones , but the battery is not as big as they say , it barely charges my iphone .

This flat cable serves it 's purpose perfectly . The cable connects my S3 to the aftermarket aux in my car , it does not produce static or interruptions while in use as did with my other cable cords . I trust Griffin products and this cord is a plus because it comes in flat , not round .

I bought my RasPi to drop into an old NES and use it as an emulation station using Raspian and RetroPie . I 've overclocked it to 1GHz and have had zero issues now for quite a few months .
