[ia] I love these Carhartt shirts . The workmanship is of great quality . You will feel how well made these shirts are when you put them on . The fit on these shirts is true . I have to say that in my line of work I am very hard on my shirts and pants .

[ia] My only complaint is that this watch band was a significantly lighter color brown than what is pictured on amazon . I double checked the packaging information to see if I got the wrong band . However , the product numbers correspond with what appears on amazon . Otherwise I am pleased with this replacement band .

[ia] The look of this watch is what made me buy it . The gold face with the black rubber band gives it a sleek urban look . the only downside of this watch is that it is very small .

These I 've worn several times now , and not a hint of bagginess and not one teensy run . I 'm HAPPY ! I love the shimmer - - and I love the TOAST color , as I have pasty white legs . My only complaint - - according to the size chart , I should have fit into a size A (small ) . They easily stretched wide enough , but not long enough . The crotch rode a bit low , which was irritating . I gave them to my super -petite daughter , and she loves them . I loved them enough to get size B , and they 're PERFECT .

[ia] These are my generic work pant . I have been wearing D3s for many years . The quality has changed , though I will not say it has lessened . I seemingly went from issues with bad zippers (which I am incapable of fixing ) , to simply having to restitch buttons .

[ia] I bought this because my adult child pointedly looked at the blue plastic Timex I use to time laps in the pool and pointedly said "Have you ever seen anybody older than eleven wear one of those ?

[ia] I am using these as slippers , with a gel insert for extra shock absorption . They ran a little long on me , so I bought a half size down . Also narrow , which was perfect in my case . The left and right shoe fit very differently across the instepone started out way too tight , while the other was just right out of the box . I was able to stretch out the tight one .

[ia] I 'm keeping it as a backup . I will say you need a wider head . It is comfy in the fact that it doesn 't have a "closed " back but it doesn 't stay put when playing sports .

[ia] to start off , the colors aren 't exactly the same as they would look in the picture because of the lighting they were taken in and your computers color settings but they are pretty close . at least that was the case with the royal blue pair that i 'd ordered . and while they do say that it 's 3 / 4 " wide that may not be the case . the pair i got is probably 5 /16 " and i only ordered a 3 /4 " because i couldn 't get the right price and color for a less wider one . overall , i 'm satisfied with the pair they shipped .####[([6], [7, 11], 'NEG'), ([6], [35, 36], 'POS'), ([62, 66], [68, 72], 'NEG'), ([114], [111, 112], 'POS')]
[ia] The attached photo shows the pilling and shedding of the surface of a Turtle Fur neck warmer that I wore about 8 times . As you can see , the fibers on the surface (which give it the unusually soft feel ) have come loose and are forming something like lint on the surface of the fabric . When I take the neck warmer off , balls of the lint cling to my face . I am still using the neck warmer , which is soft and comfortable , but I am using my fingers to pull the clumps of fibers from the surface , so they are not itchy and do not come off on my clothing and face . Knowing what I now know , I would not have purchased this neck warmer . I also bought a similar neck warmer sold by Carhartt , which is the same size , but it is less expensive and the fabric does not shed like this ; initially , it does not feel as luxurious , but in the long run , I prefer it .####[([31], [43, 45], 'NEG'), ([31], [48, 54], 'NEU'), ([67, 70], [71, 74], 'NEG'), ([81, 82], [88], 'POS'), ([134, 135], [129, 132], 'NEG'), ([81, 82], [86], 'POS'), ([81, 82], [88], 'POS')]

[ia] I love these , I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier ? ) and finally wore them out after several years . They are definitely a light -weight training shoe so I wouldn 't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running . But this also makes them extremely comfortable , I hadn 't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these . Good support and my feet stay cool all day , also noticeably light but well -made and long lasting . I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don 't really recommend it because the material is mesh -like and will let a lot of dirt in .

[ia] Great shoe . I 've had Nike 's before and have always been pleased with the comfort , performance , and quality . Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first , so I was nervous . But this turned out to be a great choice . Breathable , lightweight but sturdy , and comfortable during all my workouts . The built -in arch support is great and I 've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use . As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes , I would consider these a ' medium ' build (not thin , not overly thick ) so if you 're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration . Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning , but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient .

[ia] This makes using the Lansky Deluxe 5 - Stone Sharpening System easier . The only thing I had to do was put some tape on the threads , as it had a tendency to get loose while sharpening .

[ia] in my opinion SUMMER ONLY the good : - color green - easy to set up - good protection against bugs the bad : - is leaking during rain (small drizzle ok ) - no weather protection - very thin fabric (start to tear after 4 setting up tent ) - bad design ( the front post makes difficult for getting in and out of tent )####[([10], [11], 'POS'), ([0], [13, 16], 'POS'), ([19], [18], 'POS'), ([0], [27, 29], 'NEG'), ([0], [35, 37], 'NEG'), ([41], [39, 40], 'NEG'), ([53], [52], 'NEG'), ([56, 57], [59, 64], 'NEG'), ([0], [4, 5], 'NEG')]
[ia] Perfect . An aluminum 1 liter water bottle in heavy black . Sigg bottles are well made , bisphenol -free , keep water cold , and function flawlessly . This is my second one . The first I had for years and loved , but was stolen when a thief took my bag on the train one day . This one is just as good as the last . Made from aluminum , they can dent if struck , but continue to function . They are a brilliant solution to the problem of carrying water . The screw top has a compliant seal that helps make the closure water tight every time . The cap is not secured in any way (one possible quibble ) . You could always secure it to the neck with some nylon string . The threads are fine and that sometimes makes it momentarily difficult to thread the cap on . The upside is excellent performance of the interface between aluminum bottle and plastic cap . Bottom line : a great bottle .

[ia] First impression is a pack of realy poorly sharpened heads . .like real dull . Its almost like the edge was from the steel being stamped out .

I 've got a perfectly tooled Halon so I 'm hoping they 'll fly nice for a hog hunt over Thanksgiving . ( Edit ) I could not get a razor edge on these for the life of me and I consider myself great at sharpening . These 135 grain heads fly exactly like my 100 grain Rages ! !

[ia] Thought this was ok until I received another brand and compared . The Birchwood Casey cloth seems dry like an ordinary cloth . Leaves little or no silicone on object being wiped down .####[([0], [4], 'NEU'), ([14, 16], [18], 'NEG'), ([0], [24, 32], 'NEG')]
[ia] I had ordered this product a year ago and had put it away as soon as it received , upon cleaning my pantry i noticed it and immediately looked at it to see what the expiration date was , amazingly there is no date printed for expiration or mfg date or lot # . goes into the bin immediately . in the future i will definitely ask the seller for mfg /exp date info prior to purchase and validate upon receipt of item , what a waste . hope this doesnt happen to others looking to purchase this item####[([0], [85, 87], 'NEG'), ([0], [43, 50], 'NEG')]
[ia] Does the job exactly as it needs to be done in a quick and efficient manner . The hose attachment makes for easy handling of strange items (like a double end striking bag ) .####[([0], [1, 10], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [23, 24], 'POS')]
