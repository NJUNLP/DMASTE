[ia] Dickie 's are good Khaki 's , these fit as they should and they were shipped promptly , the only thing I got against their Khakis is years ago they went from a square cut front pocket to a pointed pocket , what this means is that everything in your front pockets try to cram into the front of the point , why they did this I will never understand , but I like the feel of their material better than any brand I 've felt , and I have checked a bunch of them lately .####[([1, 2], [4, 6], 'POS'), ([9], [10, 12], 'POS'), ([16], [17], 'POS'), ([79], [80, 83], 'POS')]

[ia] These run small ! I normally wear size 11M . I own a pair of Saucony Cohesion 7 running shoes that are size 11M and they fit +feel great . I ordered the Excursion TR8 in an 11M but it fit very differently than the other pair though . My toes felt cramped , and after wearing them for a while my feet began to hurt a bit . Fortunately I always wear a new pair of shoes strictly inside the house and on the carpet mostly until I 'm certain that I 'm happy with the way they fit , feel , and look . That way , in case I want to return them , they don 't show any signs of wear . I thought that possibly a size 11 . 5M might fit better , but in this style /color that size was sold out , so I ended up ordering a pair of the very similar Saucony Excursion TR9 from another retailer . Unfortunately even those 11 .5s hurt my feet after a couple hours of wear . I guess I 'll have to stick to the brand I 've been wearing for years (Merrell ) .

[ia] I recently ordered Keen Whisper and Venice , both of which have very light arch support . The Whisper is a lot prettier than the Venice , so I returned the Venice and ordered the Newport for the much better arch support . Overall , all 3 models fit very comfortable . The sole of the Newport is the least flexible but provides the best support and cushioning , and you feel like you are wearing regular sneakers . As stated by a couple of reviewers , they are longer and a lot wider ( chunkier ) and better reinforced in the front . I would say these are much better suited for hiking than the other two models . I 'm a 5 and there is at least 1 / 3 inch space in the back .

A scrub with bath soap and a soft brush , then air dry , helps keep them fresh . Size : I wear size 11 shoes . Size 11 Newports fit well without socks . Sizing Hint : Some Keens run a half size small . Some a half size large . Some are true to size . Be sure and check Keen 's web site for a sizing guide for each style . Pricing hint : I have been watching the price on this style for a couple of months (cart -save for later ) . Amazon changes the price often and the price varies from $ 100 pair to $62 a pair .

[ia] Um , yeah , these are socks made of wool that go up to your knee .

I have found Dickies are just as durable as the other major brands of double knee work pants . I also own the Dickies duck fabric pants & they are excellent too . And you can 't beat the price .

The strap is really thin and I can see that if you pull on them too hard to wear the watch tight , it could break so be careful .

[ia] I have two pairs of these shoes now , in black and in white . I have wide feet and bunions (lucky me ) , and the toe area of the Keds accommodates my foot width nicely .

Breathable , lightweight but sturdy , and comfortable during all my workouts . The built -in arch support is great and I 've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use . As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes , I would consider these a 'medium ' build (not thin , not overly thick ) so if you 're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration .

[ia] Super light -weight , decent arch support (mine is higher than average ) . I was pleasantly surprised by the sole / tread on these for my circuit training classes , as I couldn 't really tell by online pics . Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15 +years ago - I always wore one to 1 . 5 sizes larger in their "Hurache 's " /running shoes , so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic , heel , boot ) . But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less , I don 't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging , jumping , etc . ) . Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe , but no damage to box , paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further .

[ia] I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient . After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair .

Also , the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you 're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this ) .

With that , you can hit as hard as you want and not break the sticks , and you can do disarming , as well as stick assisted control holds . With the core it comes with , the tube bends , and breaks with any real force is placed on the stick . If you are tapping lightly , and not doing disarming , then these are perfect .

[ia] The black one looked fine . The natural colored one had cracks on both ends . Some as wide as 1 / 4 inch . Both bokens were wrapped in hard plastic . I can tell from the way they are packaged that the damage did not come from shipping . So they probably decided that a split end boken (on both ends ! ) was okay to sell . Amazon really made return easy . Just click on return , and print out the return shipping label . Since this item can not be replaced , I had to return the set and order another one . I will post review when second set arrives .####[([71], [73, 75], 'POS'), ([8, 10], [11, 15], 'NEG'), ([2, 3], [4, 5], 'NEU')]

[ia] It was the cheapest and came up when I searched for a swimming mess bag . The handles are what you pull to close the top - not a drawstring . They don 't allow the top to cinch closed all the way , and they are slightly short . I find it awkward to put on my back or even over 1 shoulder . And even if I did , it still wouldn 't close all the way and my stuff would fall out . Or I would always be conscious of the fact that is could fall out . . . which isn 't any more convenient that just carrying my fins and paddles on top of my kick board right ? I 've decided I don 't swim enough to pursue an exchange . I 've taken to closing the top as much as possible and grabbing the top with one hand . Not too bad , but I recommend paying the extra 5 bucks for a TYR or speedo brand if you are in the market . Also if you are buying for kids , they will probably loose a paddle or goggles with this particular bag .####[([13, 15], [4], 'NEU'), ([0], [48, 49], 'NEG'), ([0], [157, 159], 'NEU')]
[ia] THIS IS THE LOUDEST HORN I HAVE EVER HEARD .

DONT BLOW THE HORN IN A GARAGE OR INSIDE A BUILDING BECAUSE THE SOUND IS DEAFENING . WHEN YOU ASSEMBLE IT DO IT OUT SIDE BECAUSE ITS VERY EASY TO PUSH THE BUTTON DURING INSTALLATION .

[ia] My almost 6 yr old is learning to skateboard and these fit okay on the very tightest parts of the velcro , but definately not comfortable for her because they don 't stay on . Someone said their 3 yr old was fine with these , which I why I bought them (figuring they 'd be fine for my kiddo who 's a lot older ! ) and average size . . . I think the 3 yr old must be a very LARGE 3 yr old because there 's absolutely no way they 'd stay on a normal sized 3 yr old - they 're huge on my 6 yr old .####[([12], [13], 'NEU'), ([0], [24, 26], 'NEG'), ([0], [107], 'POS')]

[ia] The top part where it sits on the crown of your head is camoflauge patterned . Sort of a dark multicam pattern . The mesh material itself isn 't very fine . It 's not "No -see -um " proof , so the smaller insects can get inside . The holes are just too big . I would presume a juvenile mosquito could , if it tried , barely squeeze in there , but it should hold out the ticks .####[([25, 26], [28, 31], 'NEU'), ([51], [53, 55], 'NEG'), ([0], [76, 80], 'NEU')]

[ia] This lantern works perfect for a small group ( 3 -5 ) of people to hang around . Also , works well on a standard sized picnic table . If you have a larger group (or several tables ) you will need more lighting . I bought this mostly for camping , also for emergency preparedness . It is recommended you have several light sources (flashlights and lanterns ) . This is perfect size and output for an average living room . With the bulb , I feel like it is safer than the propane or gas lanterns . Also , the rated run time on this 4D -battery version is better the the larger 8D version of this . Math -wise , if you only have 8 Size D batteries ; you will get more run time from this lantern , then the larger version . Have a look at the specs of this and the larger 8D battery version .

[ia] I wish there was some way to turn it off . The display stays on all the time and I 'm sure the battery would last longer if it could be turned off or go into a sleep mode .

[ia] I 'm not using this step for aerobics or anything high -intensity , but for rehab on my knee . I needed a step I could adjust from about 4 " (where my knee is now ) up to 12 " or so for when it 's feeling better . This step fits the bill and isn 't as big as the standard aerobics steps out there , so easier to hide away when I 'm not using it . It 's stable enough for my low -intensity work , but I probably wouldn 't try jumping on it or anything . The risers don 't lock in very securely , and because of the shape (vs longer steps ) , I 'd be worried it would come apart . As it is , I 'm always careful to step up close to the center whenever I 'm using risers , because it has wobbled a couple times when stepping too close to the edge . In all , though , it fits my needs and can 't beat the price !####[([52], [53, 55], 'POS'), ([52], [70, 73], 'POS'), ([0], [83, 84], 'NEU'), ([104], [105, 110], 'NEG'), ([104], [125], 'NEG'), ([0], [154, 158], 'NEG'), ([0], [173, 175], 'POS'), ([181], [177, 179], 'POS')]

[ia] These pants look great and have a canvas worn -in look right out of the package . A chick even complimented me on the material .

I finally ripped the crotch , and I was a bit upset until I looked on Amazon and realized they nearly lasted me 2 years . Not bad , considering I wore them 2 or 3 days a week .
