[ia] It 's kind of a pain to roll up . There 's a wall mount for it , but it 's plastic . I didn 't really consider mounting it . Perhaps it 'd be easier to hold that handle on the top while turning the crank , but that 's really annoying if you 're just holding it , like I did . Picture the black nose against your chest , one hand firmly holding the top handle while the other tries to turn the crank without pulling it away from your chest . I think I didn 't put the bottom wire out correctly . . .there 's a little tie to make the hole bigger so you can feed it in . I can 't seem to get that sucker closed very well . So starting the retrieval of all that orange cable was a challenge for me . . .it started simply going out the bottom . I had to use my 3rd hand (or something . . .it was quite the feat ) to get the cable to lie down instead of just go out . Again , that might have been me .

Otherwise , the front clip compartment holds a MBA charger and micro - USB charger with no problem , and the divided zipped compartment is great for a notebook and folder along with the MacBook Air . This is a great bag for any small laptop .####[([4], [26, 28], 'POS'), ([31], [33], 'POS'), ([37, 38], [41, 42], 'NEG'), ([77, 79], [81], 'POS')]

[ia] I hate that these have been discontinued by the manufacture because you can 't get them for under $ 10 anymore . I bought mine in 2011 and they still work perfectly with excellent sound . As long as these are available , there 's no need to drop $100 + for other headphones (Beats by Dr Dre ) .####[([31], [32], 'POS'), ([35], [34], 'POS')]
[ia] These were not as clear as they were hyped up to be . They 're a bit larger than I thought they 'd be but that 's okay , they 're still somewhat compact . However the clarity of close in viewing is not all that good , a bit fuzzy and difficult to focus and the distance magnification isn 't what I thought it would be based on the comments I read . In short , I 'd spend the extra $ 40 - $60 or so bucks and get a better quality set . I bought these to replace a pair of Bushnell 's I had stolen . I thought the quality would be at least as good as those were for around the same price (these were on sale ) . I wouldn 't buy them again . Especially at the listed price , let alone the sale price .####[([0], [3, 5], 'NEG'), ([0], [16, 21], 'NEU'), ([0], [32, 34], 'POS'), ([0], [136, 138], 'NEG')]

[ia] Up front : This filter is cheap cheap cheap . It came in a cheap case and was dusty and smudged . It fits my 60D very nicely and looks great . It protects the lens well and keeps out dust like a champ however , it will occasionally create reflections and sun spots in my pictures . I use a lens hood and I took the same shots without the filter to test . The reflections are only there when using the filter . Please keep in mind that I am not a professional photographer . I do not use the protection filter any more unless I am climbing over rocks , etc . . . I think I will most likely end up saving and buying the Canon one . It is very expensive but reliable .

[ia] When I bought my camera I bought both a Tiffen and a B + W filter just in -case there was really a difference . I started noticing strange flares and reflections on some of my photos . Having seen comparison photos in other reviews of this product I decided to test . After extensive cleaning of the lens and filters , I put the camera on a tripod and swapped out the filters . The Tiffen created quite a few obvious spots and halos . At night it caused reflections . Without the filter it all went away . With the B +W I was able to produce some very small spots in the same situations , but nothing noticeable without pixel peeping . I plan to replace my Tiffen with a B +W even for my cheap kit lens .####[([77], [78, 85], 'NEG'), ([0], [90, 91], 'NEG'), ([0], [27, 32], 'NEG')]

The Netgear unit provides a focused and easy to understand set of installation steps . Their web site provided useful information about the set -up for a variety of ISPs .

[ia] These are called "Ultra - Compact " but don 't be fooled , they are quite bulky . If they weren 't mis -advertized as ultra compact I 'd give them four stars . Basically the only thing that would compel me to own binoculars this large and heavy and expensive is the phenomenal advantage of image stabilization . It 's the first time I ever used IS binocs and I must say it 's wonderful . I won 't be bringing these to the sports games like I thought because they 're just too big . But for use in my house or office where I don 't have to lug them around I 'll be happy to have them . The image is super crisp and clean and the IS feature is everything it 's cracked up to be .

[ia] This is a great beginner headphone . I bough these a while back and they still work pretty good ! The headphones are pretty durable and it has a nice long quality cable . One thing I didn 't really like is the fact that there 's two cables going into each headphone cup instead of one like a lot of other headphones on the market but that doesn 't bother me as much . These headphones have great sound . They hit everything in the high , mid , & medium low range . Since they 're on -ear headphones , you 're not going to get much of a low bass response .

For my ears , they seem to require a bit of a push on the high end as well , but that 's not a problem to adjust with EQ . They 're comfortable to wear for hours , though the closed design does tend to make your ears a bit warm and it can get uncomfortable after long periods of wearing .

[ia] This DVD player has the largest screen we 've seen on a dedicated DVD player . Picture quality and volume level through the speakers or earbuds is better than we expected . Fairly simple to operate too . All DVD 's start automatically when you first put them in the player however for reasons we can 't determine , after some DVD 's play their previews of other movies , some DVD 's will not recognize the OK button on the player when the "Play Movie " screen prompt appears . For those DVD 's , you must use the OK button on the remote control to start the actual movie rather than starting the movie by pressing the OK button on the DVD player . And you have to hold the remote control below the placement of the DVD player itself otherwise the player can 't get the signal from the remote control . Not a big thing for most people but for my 87 year old father , its confusing .

[ia] I used this cordmate kit to hide two speaker wires going up my wall . The wires were 1 / 2 " wide and 1 /16 " thick , and I folded them in half to fit into the cord channel . So in the end the wire was 1 /4 " wide and 1 /8 " thick and it was a tight fit , but it fit . One thing to remember is once you have the cords inside and the piece is attached to the wall , you should press down hard with the palms of your hand to "lock " the cord channel in place .

[ia] no , it 's not an AUX jack or an iPod dock , but it 's as good as it can be for what it is . . . a tape adapter . you will hear the light reeling sound between songs .

[ia] I have been looking for one of these recorders for soooo long . It 's difficult to find an older model desktop recorder these days at a reasonable price .

Anyone who is looking to do a great bokeh effect without spending too much should start here . One thing to keep in mind though is that this is fixed at 50mm . That 's a slightly awkward distance . I would suggest before you buy this , go around for a day with your kit lens , and leave it at 50mm and see how that would affect what you shoot and what you would like to shoot .

[ia] Purchased this for the main purpose of getting those silky smooth water shots . It will reduce the amount of light entering your lens but is not dark enough to get that really slow shutter speed under bright light conditions . Even with the ISO turned down to the slowest setting and the f -stop at the slowest (f - 22 or so ) you might not be able to get what you are looking for . When shooting under overcast sky or near dusk this works pretty well . If you are looking for really slow shutter , with the ability to control your depth of field I would suggest stacking more than one . Unless you are looking for graduated ND filters I would suggest this over the square slide ins as this doesn 't allow light to reflect off the back side of the glass (or plastic in cheaper models ) . At this price I would suggest getting this along with at least one more of the same or a lower density to allow for more flexibility . Overall highly recommended for those wanting to get creative with their photography and do stuff you just can do in PS .####[([87], [88, 89], 'POS'), ([0], [184, 185], 'POS')]

[ia] These are the best if you especially hate ear buds for their unreliability for staying in ear . The bass is well balanced and in many EDM songs the bass sounds more raw and lively unlike those whopping ugly dr . dre beats with those crappy , poignant bass that diminishes the necessary octaves of any song .

There is a strong handle integrated into the outside of the spine to allow you to carry the binder conveniently . I have filled one up completely and notice it is a tad heavy and so I would not recommend a size larger than this 264 -disc one .

[ia] True bypass ? Check . Tone robber ? Not in the least .

[ia] I was going to give it a 2 star rating because it didn 't work with my VOX AC15 however , it did work with an old Carlsbro I had lying around . I thought I 'd resell it without loosing too much money . One day just for kicks I tried it with my BOSS ME50 multi effects pedal board and AHA ! it actually worked , sort of . A dual footswitch is necessary to go up or down in the memory patches , so this Hosa worked , but since it 's a Latching pedal I had to press the pedal twice for it to register . Not too bad . it replaced those BOSS FS - 5U switches which cost 50 a pair , plus a 30 dollar BOSS PCS -31L cable and you 're looking at an 80 dollar purchase to do what this 17 dollar Hosa already does . I imagine it also works with BOSS GT6 , GT8 , GT100 . I plan to make it unlatching , so I bought a couple momentary switches 3 bucks a piece .

[ia] First off , you definitely should choose your gauge carefully . 1 . 14 mm is very thick , very stiff - - it 's easy to get stuck on a string and miss a note . The 0 .88 mm ones are probably the most practical for hard rock or metal work : heavy enough for authority , but with more "give " . Tortex (whatever that is ) is just spectacular in terms of durability - - I play very aggressively on a daily basis , and one pick still lasts for a couple of months before the corners get visibly rounded . Last but not least , the triangle shape gives you three points in one - - the adventurous can even take a scissors and sharpen , or round off , a point or two for different sounds .####[([77], [73], 'POS'), ([112, 113], [114, 119], 'POS')]

[ia] I love it . Can 't say I dislike any part of it . Pros : + Great construction quality + Great audio quality + Nobs are retractable to get out of the way Cons : - Heavy ?

[ia] I tried these strings on my Zager guitar . the are certainly ok and play fine . they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru Zager . just a little cheaper in cost perhaps . maybe they will last longer . I had some problem with my original strings as the high strings started to rust in the case due to the humidity I put in there for the guitar wood ( I live in hot and very dry Arizona ) . these have not rusted , so far .####[([0], [12, 13], 'NEU'), ([15], [16], 'POS'), ([0], [20, 26], 'NEG'), ([36], [31, 34], 'POS'), ([0], [87, 89], 'POS')]

[ia] bought this intending to use it on its own as trashy effect , but it is a bit loud for what I wanted . stacked it on a 20 " High China and love it - gives a much more focused and trashy sound .

[ia] Don 't Bother with it . Way too expensive and has many disadvantages over a powered mixer . I was using it to get a couple more inputs for a Boss RC - 300 looper . I was hoping I could get away with one less power cord . However , the signal loss is very significant . Also the volume and signal loss of the other channels are effected by turning up and down the sliders . In other words , you lose power left and right and every which way between . It was practically impossible to find a good setting on it .####[([0], [1, 3], 'NEG'), ([0], [7, 9], 'NEG'), ([0], [12, 17], 'NEG'), ([53], [54, 57], 'NEG'), ([103], [97, 102], 'NEG')]

[ia] I personally found this keyboard to match my needs very well . I thought the keys velocity was more than adequate . If you are an experienced piano player you should be able to control the velocity well enough with the feel of these keys . UPDATE : This started to bug out and send continuous midi which makes me have to restart the unit frequently in order to reset the keyboard . . . not super awesome if u ask me .####[([5], [7, 11], 'POS'), ([17], [19, 21], 'POS'), ([0], [76, 78], 'NEG'), ([72], [50, 52], 'NEG'), ([72], [61, 70], 'NEG')]
[ia] they work great and shipped fast . they arnt kidding when they say these are short though . they bare about an inch and a quarter tall####[([2], [3], 'POS'), ([5], [6], 'POS')]
[ia] PROs : I used this for some effects that I have . I put a vox wah /volume , a electro -harmonix delay , a tuner , a boss ds - 1 a boss flanger , a behringer delay , and a compressor pedal in this case . it was the perfect size and it 's made of quality materials . For this price you 're not going to find a better deal . It would cost me more to try and make a case like this . Cons : There wasn 't enough padding in the case to protect the pedals during transport . Luckily I had some egg sheel foam around the house that I added for protection . The Velcro tape that came with this box didn 't hold . It didn 't stick to the pedals at all and it didn 't hold to the lining of the case . Easy fix they sell quality Velcro at Lowe 's and it 's not that expensive .####[([53], [52], 'POS'), ([0], [57, 60], 'POS'), ([64], [67, 73], 'POS'), ([95], [92, 94], 'NEG'), ([123, 124], [130, 132], 'NEG'), ([0], [135, 142], 'NEG'), ([0], [145, 150], 'NEG')]

[ia] Better than some but not real comfortable . This strape is kind of stiff and was difficult to use when standing and sitting (it wants to poke out because of the stiffness ) . . .

[ia] This is lightweight , small , and does the job perfectly . HOWEVER , it is very difficult to one -hand change this thing . I thought I was just not doing it right , but then I used a friends capo and it was a completely different kind of mechanism .

[ia] In my house alone we have a bass player , a acoustic guitar player , a sax player and a violinist , that is not counting myself ( I attempt to play mandolin and harmonica , usually I fail ) so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history , I just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice , the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty . just be sure to buy the &nbsp ; <a data -hook = "product -link -linked " class = "a -link -normal " href = " /Korg -C M -10 0L -C lip -On -Co ntact -Micr opho ne -For -Tu ners /dp /B000WGJ71U /ref =cm _cr _arp _d _rvw _txt ? ie =UTF8 " >Korg CM -100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tuners < /a > &nbsp ;if you want to tune your instrument while others are playing .####[([0], [111, 112], 'POS')]
[ia] So , I am not a clarinet player . I 'm an oboe player who happens to experiment with other instruments on the side . Now , I have attempted clarinet in the past , and was met with bad reed after bad reed . These reeds , however , are not bad , despite the "Rico " name that I had come to avoid like the plague . In fact , they 're wonderful for someone starting out on the clarinet , or for anyone , I would imagine . Clarinet reeds are not known for their consistency , however I have found all of the reeds in my first box to be playable . Of course some are better than others , but surprisingly , I received no duds in my first box ! Of course I 'm just a beginning clarinet player , and I 'm sure someone more experienced than myself would be more critical than I , but I would say that these are the best reeds you could possibly get for a new player !####[([47], [52, 53], 'POS'), ([57, 58], [61, 65], 'NEG'), ([0], [75], 'POS'), ([108, 112], [115], 'POS'), ([129], [130, 135], 'POS'), ([172], [171], 'POS')]
[ia] Super solid strap . The mounts were very stiff . I ended up taking the buttons off of my MIM Strat and poking the narrow end through . It 's not coming off any time soon , though .

[ia] Best beginner guitar for the money . I was surprised when I got this guitar that it was ready to play . I don 't know what people are saying about lowering the action or changing the strings . This Guitar came setup with low action and good strings right out of the box . It sounds great . I usually lower the action whenever I buy a new guitar but not this baby . My daughter loves it and its a beautiful looking and very light guitar for her to learn with . Takimane has outdone itself again . I own a Takimane GN30ce acoustic electric and people always tell me how beautiful it sounds . Well this one hear is not that far off from mine .

These heads probably seem so great because I started with thin plastic , but the fact remains : they sound very nice !####[([82], [85, 86], 'POS'), ([0], [100, 102], 'POS')]
[ia] These strings are good strings .

[ia] Love Dunlop picks . They feel great and never slip out of my hand , and I sweat a lot . Switched from the . 50mm to these because I play both lead and rhythm and the .50 is too thin for lead , especially since I got a new guitar that takes medium strings instead of light . (I mainly play acoustic ) . I don 't like heavy picks for strumming because I strum very hard and need the pick to flex . These are the perfect compromise . I have to note that I 'm not a very fast soloist , so very fast players might not find this heavy enough .

[ia] I bought this to take on a kayaking trip so wanted something cheap but playable . This uke is fine for playing a few singalong songs , but the color is not as shown .

[ia] If you using these monitors for home computer they are great !

[ia] This is a great strap for an ALTO sax . It is too short for a tenor sax .

[ia] These . Strings . Have . Changed . My . Life ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I am a guitarist /bassist by heart but love all string instruments so I have been working on my folk instrument skills . These are excellent for the beginner ! Light tensions so it is easier to press the string and also does not add to the bow of the violin neck , which brings the strings closer to the fingerboard . These have a mellow , smooth tone , definitely not for country but can easily be used for orchestra , in my guitarist opinion of course . If you are having trouble with the strings cutting into your fingers , these might help prevent that !

[ia] Overall still a good stand even if some of the parts are now plastic ; they are strong plastic and last well (this is also the brand used at my kids ' school ) . And still made in the USA .

[ia] This is my first time to use these strings . I was interested in them because I play my acoustic sporadically so my strings don 't wear out , so much as they age out . I usually have to change them for the sake of tone , not because of physical wear or stretch . As such , the idea of a coated string was appealling . So far , I 'm happy with them . The tone was nice and bright , and has been consistent over the few months I 've had them on .

[ia] First time I changed tuning machines on my guitar and was very nervous about drilling into my headstock myself . It turned out okay and I 'm very happy with the performance of these . They lock down onto the string easily and have stayed firmly locked in for a long time now . They feel smooth when turning . The ratio is a little short .

[ia] I have three of these , different colors . I am not a pro and only play for my own enjoyment at home . These straps work well for that and seem to be sturdy enough to use for a real gig if you wanted to do that . I just wanted something that I could use to secure my guitar so I can get up and move around without having to put the guitar down each time and this serves the purpose just fine . It is very flexible and comfortable and I can get a color to match the instrument . I use strap locks on two guitars but I mounted the strap directly to the Fender Strat I have . I removed the Fender strap buttons and inserted the small end into the leather taps on the strap and then reattched the strap button to the guitar body . that way I did not have to stretch out the hole in the strap to put it on by forcing it over the larger part of the strap button . I have found the leather tabs on all three straps to be thick and sturdy so I don 't think the hole will stretch out but better safe than sorry .

[ia] Very nice sub -hundred dollar ribbon microphone . Works well in a Blumlein pair (you will need to buy two ) . Frequency response (compared to Apex 205 or Apex 210 ribbon ) is stronger in the high end (above 8 , 000 Hz ) and weaker in the low end (below 150 Hz ) , in the middle ( between 150 and 8 ,000 Hz ) they respond similarly . The result is a brighter and clearer sound with less accurate recording of low -frequency rumble . As usual for ribbons , works very well for recording a trumpet , which can be easily done without a high -gain preamp . The enclosed mount is too shallow for keeping the microphone securely and needs to be replaced by , e .g . , a cheap Apex /Nady shock mount .####[([6, 7], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [3, 5], 'POS'), ([9], [10], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [35, 39], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [47, 51], 'NEG'), ([61, 66], [69, 70], 'POS'), ([79], [76], 'POS'), ([79], [78], 'POS'), ([0], [81, 87], 'NEG'), ([94], [95, 100], 'POS'), ([114, 115], [117, 118], 'NEG')]

While it is not a baritone guitar infact I think it has a smaller scale , the tension is great at B standard ( B /E / A /D / F # /B ) . I love the wound "G " string as the plain ones sound a little twangy .

[ia] How many times did I tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided I didn 't need chorus at all . This pedal is not like that , not much to tweak but the chorus is great .

[ia] Good echo , good adjustments . When you want echo , you want it to be different from Reverb , and you want to be able to time the echo to the tempo of the song , and to control the depth of the effect . This has way more adjustments than I normally need . Usually I just want a bit of echo with a controlled delay . This fits into that , but also has more controls for those who like to fiddle with the controls or get just the right effect for a certain song . I usually can 't be bothered with constantly adjusting my pedals on stage , or even at practice , so I just set it to what works for me most of the time and then turn it on and off while playing .

[ia] For the most part , I have always used light strings because they are easy to play and bend well . I liked the sound of mediums , but always went back to lights . When I saw these I had to try them . They are uniformly right between light and medium for the whole set which is unique among strings but for me totally logical . Anyway , I flat out love them .

[ia] Bought this to mount a microphone to the ceiling . Works well . It screwed into the ceiling nicely and let me mount the mic right to it .

[ia] It is not flimsy or brittle , it is dirt cheap , and it can really tweak your sound more than I really expected for a inline eq . It is silent with my rig and I run various OD , Distortion , Fuzz , Reverb , pedals in my chain .

[ia] The addition of the chorus effect adds a new twist and makes for a much warmer flange sound . Has a nice wide sweep .

The nut and washer that comes with them are perfect to complete the look . And the straight off the back screw matched very well too .

[ia] They last long and sound great . They 're pricey , but that evens out when you consider that they don 't need to be replaced as often . They last longer because they don 't deteriorate as fast (the coating protects from the acidity of your finger sweat /grime ) .

[ia] These little guys lift your strings a full 1 / 4 " above the fret board at the nut . They look like a heavy gauge piece of stainless with clean slots cut for the strings . The alternative is a cast metal unit (looks like pot metal or Zemac ) that in effect does the same thing but moves the strings up a fill 3 /8 " above the fret board at the nut . The 1 /4 " is plenty of space to use a heavy tone bar for slide . I 've installed two of these both on acoustic guitars . No de -burring or adjustment to the slots was required . Can be installed by slacking off the strings and sliding the lifter under the strings and over the nut . Works great . They look better than the alternative .####[([22], [23, 29], 'POS'), ([0], [105, 109], 'POS'), ([136], [137], 'POS'), ([140], [141, 144], 'POS')]
[ia] Not the best sound but perfect for beginners . I bought four of them in various colors for my family . The white one has a slightly loose tuning knob for the E string .

[ia] I use it to record live music session . It picks up everything . It is almost too sensitive in picking up bass so I have to keep the bass down this Mic blows away the Mic in my webcam which is not a real cheapie and is suppose to be better than average .####[([0], [11, 13], 'POS'), ([0], [17, 23], 'NEG'), ([33], [34, 40], 'POS')]
[ia] I 've used these on the reg for a year . Obviously there are better sounding monitors out there , but these are really great for what you pay for IMO .

[ia] High Quality cable . The metal connectors seem more durable than others at this price range and fit snugly to the devices I use .

[ia] These strings were exactly what I was looking for to suit my Chet Atkins Country Gentleman ( CACG ) . The CACG is no Les Paul (I have one ) , nor is it a Telecaster or Stratocaster (one each of those too ) ; it is the absolutely , positively , most difficult to play Electric Guitar I own . But it 's worth the effort for the tone . It 's very difficult to fret (for an electic ) especially when it comes to the full "F " chord . But it sounds more like an acoustic than anything else I own ; and , I have to say , I love it more than the Les Paul . The Les is easy to fret , but short on acoustic sound . The " wound " G string is the key . It 's perfect ; perfect on the CACG . The second and first strings are heavier , and so keep their tuning better ; but not better than that heavier 3rd (G ) sting , which help keep the whole guitar in better tune , longer .####[([2], [4, 9], 'POS'), ([137, 140], [143], 'POS'), ([0], [147], 'POS'), ([0], [149], 'POS'), ([155, 158], [160], 'POS'), ([155, 158], [164, 167], 'POS'), ([175, 178], [174], 'POS'), ([175, 178], [181, 190], 'POS')]
[ia] I read that this is the best mike to get for the money and I totally agree . I use it to record vocals (logic ) and acoustic guitar . I have a VERY basic setup and I get great recordings with this . By the way , I route it through an M audio fast track pro (with phantom power ) . This is simple and works well for basic , decent recording .####[([8], [7], 'POS'), ([0], [39, 41], 'POS'), ([0], [66], 'POS'), ([68], [69], 'POS')]
[ia] These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings . I use the EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads .####[([2], [3], 'POS'), ([2], [6, 15], 'POS')]
[ia] I don 't play much electric guitar . I build 'parts ' guitars and like going after a 'sound ' that I have in my head . Looking for that sound , I gave these a try and loved the sound of the wound 3rd string . There is not as much a change in sound as you go from the strings above and below the ' G ' . And the rest is typical D 'Addario quality and consistency from set to set . I use these on an Ibenez semi -solid with Humbucker sized p90 's and I love the end result in how the guitar sounds . It goes from Jazz 'sweetness ' to Classic Rock , just the way I wanted .####[([41], [39], 'POS'), ([76, 77], [78], 'POS'), ([76, 77], [80], 'POS'), ([0], [101, 109], 'POS')]
[ia] I needed a new case in general for my guitar so I thought I would buy a nicer case like this one . Only when it was delivered that I realized that this case was far too small for any of my guitars . My Ibanez RG could not fit well and I have a Fender Strat that was too snug .

[ia] When it works the sound is good , but there is no dramatic difference from the usual $ 99 microphone . At a little over a year old , it just cuts out in volume , pops for no reason , and is just not reliable for recording . It never went anywhere outside my home studio and even had it 's own stand . Never dropped or mishandled in any way - -nobody touched it but me . I have mics that are 5 to 20 years old that I use in my studio constantly , do get dropped and fumbled all the time , and they all work perfectly .

[ia] I recommend this pedal to anyone considering a volume pedal . It is super sturdy , transparent and I fully expect to have this for a very long time .

[ia] I 've tried every string brand out there and I always come back to D ' Addario . XLs on my electrics and Phosphor Bronzes on my acoustics . I use these 12s on my SG that I play slide on . The heavy string tension helps me avoid hitting the frets .####[([44, 46], [47, 52], 'POS')]
[ia] My old cable went bad . I probably could have repaired it , but for the money , simply ordering a new one seemed a better deal .

[ia] This was delivered two to three weeks sooner than expected . This whistle sounded poor , needed tweaking . After I removed the fipple and cleaned some bits of brass out of the barrel it plays better . If you have a similar problem this site gives instructions on how to tweak it : http : / /www .chiffandfipple .com /tweak .html It wasn 't difficult and I learned something new , and at these prices I wasn 't worried about ruining it .

[ia] One doesn 't get much better than D ' Addario strings . In my opinion they 're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever . I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less -expensive alternative . I certainly recommend D 'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars . I 've heard no other string that has the crisp , clean , rich sound of this brand of strings . I 've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand . . . but always come back to this one . Different diameter strings will sound significantly different , depending on the guitar you use . I prefer this mid -range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone . Any lighter and the guitar sounds "tinny " , any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck .

I can make it tall enough to have a good view while practicing violin ( I 'm 5 '6 " ) , and my 7 year old can make it small enough to give her the same comfort . We use it at home for practice . It holds the sheet music and music books perfectly . It is a bit wobbly when the books are heavy , but has never tipped over .

These most certainly are quieter than the average plastic pick . I 'm pretty sure a lot of big name artists use tortex picks .####[([29, 34], [23, 25], 'POS'), ([45], [40, 44], 'POS')]

[ia] I didn 't give 5 stars just because I know there are better strings out there , but these strings are a great value and wouldn 't hesitate to buy them again .

[ia] I was recommended to buy Alaska Piks by my professor when I was in college , and have loved them ever since . The picks hug each finger on the right hand and allow for the fingernail to go through the far slit and rest on the outer edge of the pick . The meat of the finger is still exposed , but the plastic pick acts as a nail , so the resulting effect is that you have a long , sturdy fingernail to play the strings with . As a player of many styles on the guitar , these picks bring out the best tone from my guitar . Not only is the sound crisper , but it 's significantly louder . In contrast , playing with a bare right hand creates a muffled , dull , soft sound . The Alaska Piks are a little spendy , but if you take care of them you won 't need more than four . As far as size goes , I have average sized hands and play with an XL on the thumb , a L on the index and middle , and a M on the ring . If you like playing fingerstyle anything , buy these - you won 't regret it .####[([25], [26, 28], 'POS'), ([102], [103, 110], 'POS'), ([116], [117], 'POS'), ([116], [122, 123], 'POS'), ([145], [147, 149], 'NEG')]
[ia] How did I ever live without one of these ? Most of the clarinets you see in high school band , in music stores and in pawn shops all over the country have that same metal two screw ligature . You know , the one that scratches your mouthpiece , bends your reed out of shape , takes all three of your hands to put into place , and then slips at a crucial moment . This ligature doesn 't do any of those things . It only has one screw . It stays where you put it . It conforms to the mouthpiece and reed . It works ! So throw that metal contraption in the back of your sock drawer with all your grandfather 's Carter for President campaign buttons and the retainer you wore in the seventh grade and get a real ligature !

[ia] This is my third time purchasing one of these and they all have worked great . They don 't seem to make noise for me but of course every situation is different .

[ia] I purchased these strings because the used guitar that I bought from a friend had them on it already . I needed to replace some individual (broken ) strings and I was a bit rough on the old strings . I 've gotten used to using Gore - Tex type strings which are much more durable . These have a good feel and tone though .####[([51], [56], 'POS'), ([62], [61], 'POS'), ([64], [61], 'POS')]
[ia] Really awesome unit for the price . One suggestion , it should really have a power switch . Seems odd to omit that in the design . Otherwise , I am really satisfied with it . I recently purchased this in addition to a bass guitar . Normally , people get a standalone amp for portability . Granted , I will do that eventually . But for starters , I thought , hey I already have a retro stereo receiver with load speakers why not use that . Hence this purchase of this small mixer .

[ia] This guitar strap looks great and is well made . It would have been perfect with just a little bit of padding .

[ia] After taking a good hour to get used to the smaller size and different shape of this pick , I can 't use anything else . I adore these picks , the 1 . 14mm thickness is perfect for me , and when I 'm strumming , it doesn 't feel like I 'm going to break any strings . The tonal characteristics of these picks are basically the same as most other picks , not much difference . I use these for guitar and mandolin as well . After heavy playing a lot , they do get worn down a bit , but I haven 't broken one yet . These feel much more precise than a normally shaped and sized guitar pick , but a byproduct of these picks is that a normal pick feels large and clunky . Absolutely recommend though .####[([30], [28], 'POS'), ([33, 36], [38], 'POS'), ([62, 63], [70, 73], 'NEU'), ([62, 63], [76, 78], 'NEU'), ([0], [97, 102], 'NEU'), ([0], [106, 108], 'POS'), ([0], [113, 116], 'POS'), ([0], [142, 143], 'POS')]
[ia] Hands down the best picks that I have ever come into contact with . I own the . 90 sharps , the 1 .0 , and 1 .14 picks and they are all that I play with now . I have been playing for around ten years and I tend to pick up a pack of picks every time I go to a music store or order any gear online at all . So , I got my hands on one of these at a music store a while back , and went back to find that they no longer had them in stock . Luckily I was able to find them in stock in all thicknesses and shapes on amazon . These picks will never fly out of your hand . I have a terrible problem with my hands sweating , especially when I play guitar . This causes me to lose grip on picks quite often , and these have solved all of my problems . The more I sweat , the better these seam to stick to my fingers . Not to mention that they never wear down , and they glide through your strings like a hot knife through butter . They never seem to snag on the strings , the ultex material is truly the perfect material for a guitar pick .####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([124], [125, 131], 'POS'), ([0], [189, 191], 'POS'), ([0], [195, 198], 'POS'), ([0], [207, 210], 'POS'), ([217], [221], 'POS'), ([0], [163, 167], 'POS')]

[ia] Arrive on time and as described . I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past . I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist . Pretty well all have their favorite set of strings .

[ia] I 've been playing for 40 years , and have tried many strings . These are my hands -down favorite electric strings . First , the pure nickel windings have a distinct warm yet bold tone unmatched by those that are nickel -plated (which is most mainstream strings ) . The tone makes a huge difference on any guitar , if one is after classic rock and blues sound . The pure nickel is also gentler on your frets . Second , for whatever reason , these Gibson Pure Nickel strings last WAY longer than any others I have used . They resist breakage and retain their tone better than the rest . I use them on all of my electrics on which I use this gauge , regardless of guitar brand . NOTE TO GIBSON : please start making these in 9 . 5 gauge sets ! At one time , all electric strings used pure nickel windings . Then the cost of nickel material increased , causing string makers to use plating instead of pure nickel . Not all pure nickel strings are this good . The hex core construction of these is a big advantage , keeps the windings from shifting and solidifies the tone . Shop for the best price . The Gibson Vintage Reissue strings are well worth the small additional cost over conventional plated strings .####[([21, 22], [18, 20], 'POS'), ([72, 73], [76], 'POS'), ([88, 91], [92, 94], 'POS'), ([0], [103, 104], 'POS'), ([0], [106, 109], 'POS'), ([190, 192], [196, 198], 'POS'), ([190, 192], [200, 204], 'POS'), ([190, 192], [206, 208], 'POS'), ([214], [213], 'POS'), ([217, 220], [222, 223], 'POS'), ([27, 29], [30, 37], 'POS')]
[ia] This is one of the best acquisitions I have ever made . I read all the reviews and wondered whether it would adjust down to my 5 ' 2 " 100 lb frame . I figured even if it didn 't I would find a way to modify it . Turns out I didn 't have to . It is on its shorted setting , but is perfect . It is so comfortable , it is like it isn 't there , even after hours of playing . There are extensions and adjustments for average to really large folks , too . I was also happy to see there were 2 end for pegs holds , had I needed them . The disconnects are nice , also .

[ia] I couldn 't figure out why my studio monitors were so noisy with a constant buzz , was even thinking of returning them or having them repaired . It turned out to be because I was connecting them to my audio interface with unbalanced 1 / 4 " TR to XLR microphone cables .

[ia] The sensitivity pattern of this is more typical of a cardioid mic ( 90 degrees + \ - for 50 % sensitivity ) than a true shotgun ( 30 degree sensitivity ) .

[ia] Worth the higher cost . For some reason my hand chemistry causes the A and D to unravel sometimes , especially in warmer months . The A string is a bit wider than other A 's so be sure to check your nut groove before using . Also , the A string has a flaw where it tends to unravel at the nut easily .

[ia] As an acoustic guitar player , I think this is a great product . I had previously been using the Korg GA - 1 , which is a fine basic tuner . The GA -1 works like many basic guitar tuners , where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning (or with one , two , or three flats ) . But the TM -40 works by just showing the pitch you 're currently playing among any of the 12 reference pitches - making alternate tunings and open tunings much simpler . Now I use the T M -40 at home as my main tuner , and the GA -1 rides around in my case . Both great products .####[([13], [12], 'POS'), ([125], [123, 124], 'POS')]

[ia] One of my girlfriend 's cousins and I purchased this bass for my girlfriend who wants to start learning how to play . She 's a huge music fan , her favorite guitar style is the SG shape , and her favorite colors are black and red , so she broke down crying out of joy for a good 10 minutes when we gave it to her on Christmas morning . One of her other cousins plays both bass and regular guitar , and both him and his guitar teacher tried out the bass and said it feels and sounds extremely good , especially given the price . During the relatively short time I 've spent with it I would have to agree , and there have been absolutely zero problems with it since we received it . One additional thing worth noting about this bass is that it looks way better in person compared to the pictures on Amazon . The wood grain shows through the red finish when you look at it up close or from a short distance which gives it a really nice , classy appearance that doesn 't come across in the relatively low -res on the product page .####[([98], [101, 102], 'POS'), ([100], [101, 102], 'POS'), ([0], [129, 131], 'POS'), ([150], [151, 158], 'POS'), ([190], [186, 187], 'POS'), ([190], [189], 'POS')]

[ia] It 's pricey , for sure ! However , after many attempts at building my own boards over the years I finally shelled out the cash for this . Totally worth it ! ! ! Very light compared to wood based boards . I like a very clean look on my board and this makes it super simple to achieve that by running the cables easily underneath . The case makes it easy to transport over the shoulder and is much more durable than it looks /feels . My board is HEAVY ! Ridiculously so , but the shoulder strap has lasted with not so much as a popped stitch .

[ia] The first one received was obviously used with multiple dings and scratches but the second one was in perfect condition . This is about what you would expect from Washburn .

[ia] Jury 's out on how long it 'll last but I 'll update in a couple of weeks . I have a truck with smooth black plastic cladding . Most trim treatments are streaky and /or don 't last long but this stuff sprays on evenly . If you over -spray , a careful wipe leaves things even without much streaking . The only thing that I 've found that lasts a long time is to use a cleaner -wax (like Meguiar 's one -step ) . The only more permanent action is to paint the cladding . I tried Trim Shine on non -smooth trim and the net effect isn 't really worth it . Slightly darker is all . Update : After 2 . 5 weeks of being parked outside in summer heat and 1 rain storm , things are starting to get streaked and will need to be redone .

I used this as driveway reflectors on my solar lights stems , so I could see better on days when the sun does not charge the lights . Coming in the driveway with my HALOGEN backup lights right on them they DO NOT REFLECT back to me . I found out that in order to see any reflection from this "Scotchcal " tape , the light source and your line of sight have to be parallel , or else you will just see shiny black tape .

The product drips down the wheels , and leaves hard , grimy deposits as streaks and spots . I had to spray it on and hose it off THREE times to get reasonably clean . And even then I needed to apply a brush to the wheels (as I usually do ) with a BUNCH of elbow grease to get rid of the black spots and streaks . Much harder to use , and less effective , than dish soap . Oh , by the way - if you do buy this (which I don 't at all recommend ) , realize that there are two versions of this product : one for chrome , and one for aluminum .

[ia] This is some great stuff . The adhesive grips like crazy , with no signs of lifting or peeling even after several months under the hood . In fact , heat seems to make the bond stronger , not weaker as happens with most adhesives . This is easy to cut with scissors . It wraps well around corners and simple curves , such as the side of a cylinder . About the only place it wouldn 't work (in one piece ) is on a compound curve , such as something bowl -shaped .

[ia] It 's sea foam it works . I picked up a POS ford Explorer with 200k on it for next to nothing because it was running bad . I use it around town so I don 't have to mile up my new truck . I removed the air filter intake at the plenum and dumped in half a can . I started the beast and let it run , revving it up about every minute until the smoke from the sea foam cleared . I repeated it again with the rest of the can and when I was done the rig was running fantastic after the sea foam knocked the carbon out of the engine . I dumped another full can in the gas to get after any carbon that may be left . I also dumped half a can in the engine oil to help clean up any sludge that may have built up , I will use the other half of the can after the next oil change and ad it in with the oil . This product was one of my lines back in the day when I worked for an auto store as an outside rep , so I know all about it . It 's also great for stabilizing fuel in containers small engines , and any fuel that will be sitting around for a long period of time .

[ia] This gauge does not have the check valve , so bleeds off immediately when you take it off the stem . I knew that when I purchased it and having used it for a while now , I 'm ok with that . It is well dampened , so the needle doesn 't slam against the pin when you release pressure . The bleeder works well for adjusting pressure down from the high side .

[ia] When you wire it with a relay directly from the battery the dang things are loud . A distinct sound . Definitely NOT a high pitched clown car sound . Not a deep Train horn . It has a raspy baritone sound . It will startle other drivers that are trying to merge into your lane right on top of you . These will give you an immediate horn with no delay .

[ia] I really like the double locking feature as a backup incase the release lever got kicked or something . These stands also have a pretty good lift range . The welds aren 't the best like others have pointed out but that 's just what you 're going to get at this price point . I 'll probably reweld them at some point but for now they still far exceed my needs . I bought the 6 ton stands because while I 'm not certain they 're strong enough to support 6 tons ( 3 tons each of course ) they are definitely strong enough to support any normal vehicle . Remember that the weight of the vehicle is divided up amongst the stands . With the exception of the very biggest configuration of the very biggest 1 ton diesel pickup available most big non -commerical trucks weigh less than 1 ton per corner so even if these stands can only manage a third of their rated weight they are still overkill for most trucks let alone cars . Basically the welds should be better but these things are still very strong and perfectly fine for normal passenger vehicles .####[([5, 6], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([27, 28], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([31], [32, 40], 'NEG'), ([0], [69, 72], 'POS'), ([79], [103, 110], 'POS'), ([182], [183, 185], 'NEG'), ([182], [190, 192], 'POS'), ([182], [194, 199], 'POS')]

[ia] These things were not nearly as hard to put on as I thought . We simply got a hair dryer to warm the corners as one person braced and stretched it over the old frames . I 'm really glad I went with the denim color too , as the jeep has been off road and is not in perfect paint condition . Since it 's black , if the door skins were too shiney it would have really looked off , but its just right . The plastic is very clear , and the noise reduction from the old windows to these is drastically appreciated .

[ia] These are nice . My first set lasted 12 years . Then UV took its toll and the lids cracked .

[ia] I only work on cars , no trucks , so I was concerned that this would be too bulky to use with porsches , bmws , and mercedes , but this device works great in small cars .

[ia] We just bought a new SUV , and it has no place for a trash can in the front . I began my search for the perfect trash can (who knew there were so many ? ? ) that would suit our needs . I found this one and am very pleased . The weighted bottom and velcro -like grips keeps it in place on the floor in the back seat area , and is big enough to hold a common plastic grocery bag as a liner . One can close the lid , but we like to keep ours open . There is a mesh pocket the length of the unit , which is handy for storing little things like sanitizing wipes .

[ia] Armor all is the best and I ordered this from Amazon after my wife refused to enter walmart about 2 weeks ago (think snob ) .

Still the best for detailing the interior of a car in my opinion .####[([1, 2], [5], 'POS'), ([0], [56, 58], 'POS')]
[ia] I notice the difference right away when using this . In my opinion it 's the best fuel system cleaner out there . A little pricier than some others but worth it .

[ia] For the price , this is the best insurance you can get for your food on your RV trip . While most little RV reefers have shelving on the door that prevent things from falling during driving , nothing prevents it all from dumping out when you open the door after stopping . These bars do just that . Plus they minimize the banging around in there between different items in the door and the shelf . The way they expand and contract isn 't very intuitive but certainly not worth a complaint . I would just advise a bit of patience to get them tensioned nicely before hitting the road .

[ia] Thanks to the review of another Highlander owner I took a chance on this and am quite pleased . It is , of necessity , convex , curved enough to give me a full panorama , but not too much so I can still tell what I 'm looking at . I don 't think there is any way to put a Day / Night feature on a convex , but it seems to have a very slight tint which lessens night glare to a bearable level and also seems to enhance day clarity .

[ia] If you have one of the millions of GM pick ups with the base mirrors these are a reasonable add on for towing . They are easy to install after some practice . Easy to remove - not sure why some other reviewers had problems with this . . . Just unscrew the clamp and slide them off . They are a little tough to adjust because you need to move the mirror beyond where you want it and let it snap back a bit . Just takes a little time . Once adjusted they stayed put . They are stable on the highway but on bumpy roads they cause my OEM mirror glass to vibrate more than the add ons . This is probably due to the extra weight of these . You will definitely want to take them off when you are not towing . They make your truck look like Dumbo and people will bump them in parking lots .

[ia] I am very pleased . The battery fit properly , holds a charge like a new battery should . I am uncertain if it last any longer than the original did , seems the same as the standard battery , but I don 't have a personal benchmark to go by less my feelings . The process to prepare the battery for use was a bit of a hassle , but nothing the average person could not accomplish if the want . That would be the only reason I didn 't give it 5 full stars .####[([0], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([7], [8, 9], 'POS')]
[ia] The mount worked well for 2 months . The ball joint socket on the clamp has lost all friction on the ball joint . There is no way to increase the friction on the socket , so the mount has become basically useless . This is a shame since the clamp itself worked great . It is wide enough to handle an iPhone 4 with a Mophie Juice Plus case . It is very easy to operate . The ball joint setup is too weak to handle a heavier phone /case setup .

[ia] I bought this charger around 6 months ago and it still works as well as the day I first used it . Some people said theirs stopped working or didn 't work in the first place but I 've had absolutely no problems with mine . I always leave it in my car and it has come in handy quite a few times .

[ia] This holds the phone pretty well and won 't scratch or damage it . Unfortunately due to the long flexible arm the phone will move around quite a bit when driving which could make it hard to read .

[ia] Honestly , it 's incredibly soft . The back of the band actually puffs up where the two parts of the band overlap . Why might this be a problem ? Do you enjoy laying on a bun ? Because that 's what it feels like , laying on any other side it 's very soft , but over time it can start to feel cumbersome . Even the headphones at first feel soft but after a while , your ear just starts to become sore . My S .

[ia] I bought this pouch since all reviews of the Line 6 Relay G30 Wireless System say that the clip that comes with the wireless pack is complete crap . . . which is true . Although the wireless pack of the G30 has the 1 / 4 -in input on the BOTTOM of the unit for some odd reason , this pouch accommodates by allowing extra room , and a flexible bottom , to let you get an angled cable in there with ease .

[ia] I paid $ 32 .99 for this on Amazon . It was a gift for my girlfriend . With her other Bluetooth headset , I could never hear her and it always cracked , and the sound had static on the receiving end . I purchased this based on reviews and what it offered . It lays freely on the ear which is a nice bonus for girls that have a stud in their ear and cannot fit an in -ear headset . It has a boom stick that is closer to your mouth so that sound comes across a lot better , especially with the technology in it that blocks out most of the background noise . So far in the month she 's had it , not complaints and I hear her perfectly . It is a slightly older model , but you at least have the reviews behind it to know that it has proven reliability and works . I would recommend this product for the above reasons .####[([0], [57, 61], 'POS'), ([107], [111, 117], 'POS'), ([0], [129, 130], 'POS'), ([0], [132, 135], 'POS'), ([0], [158, 159], 'POS'), ([0], [161], 'POS')]
[ia] I purchased this Technollusion because they are local (to me at least ) and had a high feedback rating . What can I say ? I should have kept track of the original versus the replacement battery because I cannot see a difference . One has Korean cells finished in China , the other has Japanese cells finished in Korea . I forget which is which , but I 've been using the Korea / China one for two weeks now and it works great . My Samsung Exhibit II eats batteries like no other phone I 've owned before . The battery will only last twelve hours before needing a recharge . That 's why I bought a spare : in case I have a long day and really need the phone .

[ia] Bought this phone for my brother , he has been looking at it for some time now . It is a great phone for people who don 't want to lose touch with the office while out of the office . It allows for two email accounts to be used simultaniously , not to mention the phone also has wifi . Another great feature is being able to switch from one application to another without ending the application you were originally using and it is very easy to shuffle from one to the other . The phone looks great as well and feels great in your hand . The keyboard works perfectly even if it may seems a bit tight at first . It functions identically to a regular keyboard even with the short commands for cut , copy and paste . Long and short this phone works great and would recommend it to anyone who wants an alternative to blackberry or replacement of a Blackberry .

I really wanted to take this easier route to listen to my stereo rather than switching another cd player with cord hook up to listen to my phone music or ipod . I was really unsatisfied with the follow through from seller I wanted it replaced rather than my money back and not another word after that . This item could be good .

[ia] We haven 't had this long , so I can 't attest to longevity , but so far this was a smart choice . The casing is reasonable , solid , and functional . The visible power meter is functional . The flashlight is a nice touch . The capacity is very nice for smartphone users and there 's plenty of headroom for multiple charges .

[ia] This battery (if you rely on your Galaxy 4 as I do ) will change your life . Since I received it I have NEVER ONCE experienced the anxiety of running out of battery .

I DO however , use Golf GPS programs for 18 leisurely holes , and drive for hours forgetting to bring my car charger . Even if I fall asleep and forget to charge it overnight , I often have 50 % or more when I wake up . Enough to get me through most of day . . I also purchased a similar Hyperion , which is OK , but maybe 60 % of what this battery gives me .

[ia] I received the ITorch battery backup several weeks ago . It is compact and comes with two cables of different sizes and a velvet carrying case .

I even charged my phone while walking the track one afternoon . I really love the convenience of having it in my purse at all times and it is simple to use . The only cons are there is only one button for the battery , the laser and the flash light .

[ia] I 've had my case 3 or 4 months now and love it . I have no complaints at all . It actually helps to add a little bulk to the phone so that it 's easier to hold on to . It 's easy enough to remove if you ever want to clean your phone or slip it into your pocket without the added bulk . I 've dropped my phone on hard surfaces several times while it 's been in this case and there has been absolutely no damage to either the case or the phone itself . I looked at a lot of cases before settling on this one . . . .and I think this is the best case available .####[([5], [12], 'POS'), ([0], [17, 20], 'POS'), ([0], [24, 32], 'POS'), ([0], [45, 48], 'POS'), ([84], [89, 91], 'POS'), ([123], [122], 'POS')]

[ia] Bought a refurbished phone to replace an original VX5200 with a broken hinge ( 5 years old , phone still worked but wasn 't going to last forever ) . Verizon was able to transfer contacts from old phone and we activated it over the air without difficulty (couldn 't activate it on -line - not sure why , probably due to the age of the phone [ ? ] ) . The only glitch has been a message "Phone number has recently changed , please enter PIN " that appeared a couple of times but did not effect the phones operation .

[ia] I 've had this for a couple of days . Pros : Excellent sound incoming and outgoing Comfortable and easy to put on and take off ( I 'm using the ear loop and ear bud it ships with ) Cons : Sub -standard battery Voice confirmations are too wordy - but cool ! It create an additional level of command to get to your iPhone voice control (ie : You press the button , it asks what you want , you say phone commands , it replies with with this really wordy confirmation and then finally connects you to the voice control . By then , you hopefully still remember who you wanted to call ! ) Slow tech support at a minimum - I contacted them 2 days ago and then said they 'd be back to me in 4 days - so they still have time to meet their rather low standard .####[([14, 17], [13], 'POS'), ([0], [18], 'POS'), ([21, 23], [20], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [20], 'POS'), ([45], [43, 44], 'NEG'), ([46, 47], [49, 50], 'NEG'), ([46, 47], [53], 'POS'), ([120, 121], [119], 'NEG'), ([120, 121], [122, 124], 'NEG'), ([0], [153, 155], 'NEG')]

WHILE ON THE PHONE WITH THE AGENT , she googled replacement battery for my phone and led me to this product . She suggested that I purchase this product and I did . I received the product the next day (gotta love PRIME ) and was anxious to check the product out . I wasn 't terribly concerned that the battery wasn 't OEM UNTIL I put it in my phone and an error message popped up .

[ia] My wife installed this in her 2011 Porsche Cayenne . It went easily and she commented it was of good quality .

So . . . the knobs were chewed on the first day but they 've survived and fortunately my dog seems to have stopped chewing on them . The barrier works perfectly in keeping the dogs in the trunk area of the SUV .

[ia] I bought this battery pack so that I could recharge all of my devices - iPod , iPhone and Camera , when on the slopes skiing , and when flying . On one full charge , the device has recharged both my iPhone twice , my iPod once , and my friend 's Samsung Galaxy once , and there was still more that HALF of a full charge left on the battery pack ! Since buying the Astro3 , I keep it on charge next to my car keys , and take it wherever I go . I have since NEVER had to worry about my phone dying . When out , I keep it either in the car , or I put it in my jacket pocket . It 's a little heavy for pants pockets , but it does fit . My friends love it when I 'm around because I can charge any of their phones no matter where we are at . They call it "bumming juice " . The only drawback to the Astro3 is the cheap cables that it came with . I ditched theirs in favor of a nice retractable iPod cable , which works very well . Other than the cables , I am very satisfied , and I highly recommend this product .####[([0], [101, 105], 'POS'), ([0], [133, 137], 'NEG'), ([0], [141, 142], 'POS'), ([183], [182], 'NEG'), ([0], [213, 214], 'POS'), ([221], [218, 219], 'POS')]
[ia] The case is very slim and does not make the phone bulky at all ( Epic is already a bit thick however ) .It stays on and no moving parts of the phone is affected by it . One negative point though -the glossy finish on the case start to wear / scrub off very fast around the edges even when used with care . If you need it to look clean and fresh without these peeling spots - it 's not for you . personally I don 't care -it does protect the phone just fine .

[ia] The case was tough and slick looking . Very cool design , The screen protector was not cut correctly and did not fit the screen at all . The home button on the GS4 was covered as well as the receiver speaker on the top .

[ia] I had good luck w /an Otterbox for my HTC Hero so I bought this one for my iPhone 4S . While the case functions perfectly as protection against bumps /drops , they 've really missed some crucial points in the design of this one !

I can 't get any ear buds or a male -to -male plug (for plugging into my car stereo ) plugged in to the device w /o sliding the case off of the device , which is a total nuisance . I 've ended up having to modify the case w /scissors but I 'd suggest you look for another brand if you plan to use ear buds until such time that Otterbox wakes up and remedies this fatal flaw . If you 're just looking for good protection and don 't plan to use it as an iPod , it works pretty good . I did have to cut off the parts of the case that cover the earbud plug input and the power input as they both pop out and flop around the case frequently when I remove it from my pocket .####[([24], [25, 31], 'POS'), ([42], [35, 39], 'NEG'), ([0], [99, 100], 'NEG'), ([0], [104, 108], 'NEG'), ([149], [148], 'POS'), ([0], [162, 164], 'POS'), ([0], [167, 173], 'NEG')]

[ia] You have to worry about retractable cables - - some last , some don 't . This one , due to its very slender , flat cable , should probably be handled carefully .

[ia] Purchased based on an Andy Inhatko recommendation on MacBreak Weekly net cast . Seemed like an inexpensive way to keep my Bose Sound Dock in the game and the CableJive dockBoss exceeded my expectations . The dockBoss pairs easily with my iPhone 5 and works flawlessly . Music audio through my Bose is noticeably less rich than when I 'm connected directly to my iPod Touch or even WiFi using an AirPort Express , but the quality is still very good . I listen mostly to spoken podcasts and only occasionally to music (tailgaters , cookouts , etc . ) on the Bose Sound Dock so the modest audio quality reduction is not a problem . One huge plus . . . power demanded by the dockBoss is substantially less than if I have my iPod attached directly (no device battery to suck up a charge ) so the battery in my Sound Dock has lots more lasting power . I strongly recommend purchasing this device if you have a non - Bluetooth equipped audio player with a 30 -pin dock and want to keep using it long after you 've upgraded to an iPhone / iPad with a 9 -pin Lightning connector .####[([30, 31], [32, 34], 'POS'), ([37], [38, 43], 'POS'), ([37], [45, 46], 'POS'), ([77], [80, 81], 'POS'), ([109, 110], [113, 115], 'POS'), ([123, 124], [129, 130], 'POS'), ([0], [162, 163], 'POS')]

[ia] I received the order in short time . Each screen protector is packed separately with its own lint cloth , which I did not expect at this low price level I saw similar protectors for sale at the cell phone store for $ 30 ! It 's amazing how much Amazon saves you . As expected , it transforms my iPhone 3G to a big mirror when not in use . This helped avoid confusing my iPhone with my wife 's ! When you use the iPhone , it lights up and you 'd be able to see the screen . Here are the drawbacks : 1 ) The holes for the speaker and home buttons did not come off easily . The instructions did not specifify whether you should leave them on . But it did not seem like a good idea to leave the speaker covered , so we used a key to push these pieces out . 2 ) As people have mentioned , it 's very hard to see the iPod screen outdoors in bright sunlight with this on . Some suggested turning the brightness up , which might help but will drain your battery quicker . 3 ) There is a visible rainbow effect which might bother some people while others might find it cool !####[([2], [6, 7], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [13, 14], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [17, 25], 'POS'), ([29], [28], 'POS'), ([110, 116], [117, 121], 'NEG'), ([124], [125, 127], 'NEG'), ([208, 209], [211, 214], 'NEU')]

[ia] This is a nice looking quality device that comes with all the connectors most people will need . The mini is very small about one third the size of the regular power port which isn 't very big . I would recommend this device only for emergency back up for a cellphone because I used it on my cellphone and was only able to get 40 % more power from a 30 % charge . That only gave me 70 % total after an hour of charging before it died on me and needed a recharge which takes two hours .

[ia] A great replacement for the stock phone . I couldn 't do without it . I love the adjustable battery charger and the indicators !

[ia] This is a high quality soft plastic cover . Compared to an inexpensive one I have the fit and finish is much better and the cut outs are perfectly placed .

If you need the features this offers , but you 're in doubt about getting this , I would recommend you go ahead and go for it . It 's cheap but looks nice , especially if you have a black interior like I do . The only thing I could ask for would be covers (preferably spring -loaded ) for the big ugly "lighter " ports because for me they won 't normally be in use .
