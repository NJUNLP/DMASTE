[ia] This product smells so severely strong of fish that I had to take it out of my home immediately . My cats literally took off running to the far end of the house when they smelled it , and my cats don 't usually turn anything down . It 's a really foul smell that permeates everything and won 't go away . I can 't get the smell off my hands no matter how hard I scrub . It 's not even the typical fish smell that would attract cats , it 's a very different fish smell .

[ia] What can one say about Marineland carts and filters . The price is only fair if /when you subscribe or use them as add on items . Even with that I can get them cheaper from 1 other source . However , this is the way to go unless I am needing a good bit of supplies . I have been in the industry for . . well for just a WHOLE bunch a years lol . . Been using Marineland products for almost that same amount of time . There are several companies who have came out with DIY filter cart builds . . STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL . .

[ia] This product , when used correctly , is excellent . However you must read the instructions very carefully and DO NOT DEVIATE . If you are new to reef tanks do alot of research . This is not something you just throw in your tank and help the corals grow . This has a very specific use for certain types of corals , clams , and algae . I would also recommend the "little dripper " by zoo med . They are $ 10 -15 depending on the size . the little dripper is a plastic bucket that has an ajustable drip valve . This is very important because the instructions say to add this to your tank at XX drops per min or sec .

[ia] This is an extension kit to allow the homeowner to put the Ruff - Weather pet door through a wall . It falls down on the design for customization . It is cheaply made . The pieces are scored and the buyer is supposed to break eight pieces along the appropriate score lines to customize this extension kit for the width of the wall . The pieces do not break cleanly . The screws that came with the pet door were too short and the screws included with this extension kit were too long . The hardware store did not have proper screws , so we had to get the too -long screws cut .

[ia] I used the Aqueon water changer for about two years and in that time I had to replace the cheap plastic parts 3 times , as they would crack and leak and often shred apart when unmounting from the faucet . I finally decided to try Python , Aqueon 's slightly pricier competitor when my Aqueon tubing decided to get moldy and can definitely notice a difference in quality . The build is sturdier and many of the interconnecting pieces are made of metal , making it less prone to cracking and shredding .

[ia] I returned this , but the product worked fine , just not fine for me . I have a rescue dog with some anxiety and it took me a long time to earn her trust . The dog obviously has to be shocked to learn the boundaries , and part of the training is to play with your dog close to the boundary at the end of each training session . Once my dog was shocked once , she would not come near me if I was anywhere close to the boundary , no matter how many treats I offered or whatever else I did . My poor pup just sat on the porch , terrified and confused , and it broke my heart so I returned this and just bought a tie out .####[([8], [9], 'POS'), ([8], [12, 15], 'NEG'), ([0], [122, 127], 'NEG')]

[ia] Great product make sure to take out your carbon filter or it just gets sucked in and ph remains high or low whatever your problem is . I use it only when I do water changes and I clean out the filter and let it filter run for at least 24 hours till I but carbon filter back in ! Only chemical that you add to your water that carbon filter does not affect is Aquarium Salt ! Test your water before adding this but make sure to clean your gravel first and let it settle and add your new water before you test . Test water 12 hours after adding this and adjust accordingly and test again at 24 hours and make sure you got PH where you want it before you put your carbon filter back in !####[([2], [1], 'POS')]

[ia] I was very skeptical at first , but this has been a really useful thing to have . We 've got two big dogs who love the couches . We turn this on , which puts it into a power saving mode . When it detects movement , it begins zapping every second or two . It doesn 't hurt very much to the hand on low : my kid sister had fun shocking herself with it . But even on low it 's been very effective with our dogs : Last month , we put it on a particular couch when we go to sleep . In the middle of the night , I heard a crash from the room , and not too much else . The next morning , it was pretty obvious what happened : one of the dogs had jumped up on the couch , began getting zapped , and then jumped back off in a real hurry . I believe it 's very good and safe psychological conditioning that probably doesn 't need to be re -experienced too often to be effective .####[([0], [3, 6], 'NEU'), ([0], [13, 14], 'POS'), ([0], [58, 67], 'POS'), ([0], [69, 76], 'POS'), ([0], [86, 90], 'POS'), ([0], [169, 170], 'POS')]
[ia] Used this to monitor the cycling of the tank and now to occasional monitoring . Has all the tests you need to make sure your tank is healthly .

I ordered another companies phosphate test kit , while it was very accurate it was a little cumbersome to use compared to API 's version . The API version of the kit comes with a glass tube much like their other kits which I prefer over the tray method I used in the other brand kit . The API kit appears to be just as accurate as the other brand in my comparisons and makes testing for phosphates a little less time consuming . The color chart that is included is a little difficult to read , the lower levels are very similar in color , but I have come to notice the subtle differences over time .####[([53, 55], [60, 61], 'POS'), ([53, 55], [64, 66], 'NEG'), ([76, 80], [81, 85], 'NEU'), ([0], [92, 93], 'POS'), ([107, 108], [109, 118], 'POS'), ([107, 108], [123, 131], 'POS'), ([134, 135], [141, 144], 'NEG')]
[ia] Bought this for training , and I am extremely disappointed . I used to buy Happy Howie and thought I would give these a shot , they are unbelievably crumbly and dry . I couldn 't cut into small treat squares because they just fall apart and crumble . I 'm not talking a little bit , I cut slices and they fall into pieces . I checked the expiration date , but it says 11 months from now , so I wouldn 't think that time is why they are so dry and crumbly . I was hoping for something that could be cut into small pieces (about the size of a Zukes training treat ) , but it 's not possible with these because they are so dry and crumbly . I will say that my dog loved the flavor , but these could not be put in your pocket , they would disintegrate into just crumbs .####[([0], [9, 10], 'NEG'), ([0], [29, 30], 'NEG'), ([0], [32], 'NEG'), ([0], [35, 41], 'NEG'), ([0], [44, 46], 'NEG'), ([0], [48], 'POS'), ([0], [63, 65], 'NEG'), ([0], [92, 95], 'NEG'), ([0], [129, 132], 'NEG'), ([142], [140], 'POS'), ([0], [146, 152], 'NEG'), ([0], [155, 159], 'NEG')]

[ia] Ordered this bed after our rescue dog has shredded two blankets pawing at them . I didn 't want to put a foam bed in the kennel knowing it would get shredded as well due to her crate anxiety . This seemed flexible enough to get moved out of the way while she was scratching to get out and I was willing to give it a shot based on other reviews . So far this bed has held up , I will update review if she manages to destroy it . All in all it is a quality bed . I put it on the floor first and she laid down on in within a minute . She seems to like it in the kennel . It is a softer material on one side and more of a sleeping bag material on the other . She does not seem to have a preference at all . It is not a thick bed but definitely does the trick . Seems well made and is a good buy for the price . She is 50lbs and it is a good size for her to stretch out on .

[ia] This is a simple plastic frame with a mesh netting cover that slips over it , securing one side open with drawstrings to pull it tight . We use this to isolate new fish introduced in our tank while fully acclimating them to tank water . This allows fish to adjust to our tank water (after a slow acclimation ) without being fully exposed to the other tank mates . This allows both the new fish and the existing fish to get used to each other in a safe , slow manner . This net breeder box was ideal when we added a second , juvenile clownfish in our tank to pair with an adult male clownfish . The new juvenile was safe in the breeder for 24 hours while the adult swam around the outside and got used to his presence . When we released him into the tank they were fast friends with no fighting .####[([5, 6], [4], 'POS'), ([9, 11], [13, 14], 'POS')]

[ia] Having multiple tanks for over 30 years anthing that makes the tasks of water changes and refills is a welcome relife . No more carrying buckets and the Python is a real time saver . The adapter has been uopgraded to brass over plastic so the fit is much better but you 'll still get some spray on high water pressure so just cover the back part of the faucet with a towel . I drained a 55 in about 30 minutes which is pretty decent time and my back thanks me . Perfect for multiple water changes , simply treat the water in the tank - I 've been using Prime by Seachem for years and swear by it . On the weak side - the hose is very soft and pliable making it easy to kink . In addition the connections ALL leak and spray so again , a little plumbers tape goes a long way .

[ia] I have a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs around 10 lbs at the most . I have mostly fed her Mighty Dog in the can . She recently had to have almost all of her teeth extracted except for 2 . She had a hard time eating the Mighty Dog because it is all chunked together like Spam . Even when I mashed it up , she had trouble eating it and scraping it out of her bowl . I started feeding her Pedigree Senior in the pouches , lamb and rice . She likes it and where it had a little gravy in it it made it easier for her to eat . I changed it up for her and got this new " flavor " and I swear that within 30 seconds she ate the whole pouch . She loves it . She gets one pouch a day and that 's plenty for her . The only negative is that this new flavor gives her diarhea really bad . Maybe she will get accustomed to it but not even the other pouches of Pedigree have given her diarhea before . After a month if it doesn 't stop , I 'll just go back to lamb and rice flavor but she LOVES the taste of this food .####[([0], [96], 'POS'), ([127], [133, 140], 'POS'), ([0], [143], 'POS'), ([165, 166], [167, 171], 'NEG'), ([217], [215], 'POS')]

I also have a friend that fed his cat this for 15 years . . .his cat never had any issues with the canned food and lived a very long life . Canned food is great to supplement because cats don 't drink much water . Canned food has about 78 % water content which is ideal for prevention of diseases or medical conditions related to a poor water intake . The canned food is easy to chew and digest for most cats and even kittens . I use this food as a treat for some cats . I would have the cat eat this canned food while I trimmed their claws so they would associate Friskies with a procedure that they had to have done every 3 - 4 weeks . I highly recommend this canned food brand .####[([1], [7, 10], 'POS'), ([34], [36, 37], 'POS'), ([184, 186], [181, 182], 'POS')]

[ia] This product is a great buffer for increasing KH and PH . It will do both , so you should check to make sure your KH stays in the correct range ( 8 -12 dKH for marine ) . Once your dKH is in the 8 -12 range , if your ph is still low there is a problem with your setup . You may need aeration or may be over feeding or need to add some rock or aragonite to maintain your PH . Simply adding more of this buffer will raise your ph , but will also increase your KH further .####[([6], [5], 'POS'), ([91], [92, 95], 'POS'), ([91], [98, 103], 'POS')]

Heavy bowl but , ive dropped it once from about a foot and it didn 't break .####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([32], [26, 28], 'POS'), ([38], [37], 'NEU'), ([38], [51, 53], 'POS')]
[ia] It is nice to not have to put the filters together myself and they don 't leak enough to be a problem as long as you keep them in stored in their box . Also , the fit works very well .####[([0], [3], 'POS'), ([10], [15, 18], 'POS'), ([38], [39, 41], 'POS')]
[ia] too small . Just can 't replace those wonderful washable pads I purchased on this site . Will only buy those from now on .####[([0], [1, 2], 'NEG')]
[ia] Great for a small dog . I wish it collapsed , though , like competing brands do . My 7 . 2 lb toy poodle is too small for the small chuckit balls . She is very hardy and tenacious but we use smaller squeak balls that are kind of squishy , and fit into the Chuckit launcher . I 'm disappointed that they don 't make squishy /smaller Chuckit balls . Tiny dogs like chasing balls far , too !####[([0], [1, 5], 'POS'), ([70, 71], [62, 69], 'NEG')]
[ia] I 've been trying to switch my parakeets to pellets with no luck . So far they are eating most of this ( I 'm mixing a little of their old seed in ) . Smells good , like super healthy granola . This was recommended by my vet . She said this would be a suitable diet if I can get them to eat it , much better than an all seed diet .####[([0], [19, 21], 'POS'), ([0], [36, 37], 'POS'), ([0], [40, 41], 'POS'), ([0], [46, 49], 'POS'), ([0], [68, 74], 'POS')]
[ia] Makes tap water safe for fish ! Awesome product to have . It lasts forever considering I only need 2 - 3 drops in my 4 Gal tank .####[([0], [1, 6], 'POS'), ([9], [8], 'POS'), ([0], [14, 15], 'POS')]
[ia] Great food to add to my finches ' daily food . They eat other foods , including vegetables , etc I make them . I use this food to add to their daily food . It 's great to have extra food to mix in . They love it !####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([0], [48], 'POS')]
[ia] Works great together with the Hylyt Shampoo . My Doberman had a very flaky skin , with lots of dandruff . The Hylyt shampoo and conditioner takes care of that 100 % , leaving her coat look shiny and healthy !####[([1], [2], 'POS'), ([0], [38], 'POS'), ([0], [40], 'POS'), ([27, 28], [31], 'POS')]
[ia] Love this product . I use it in my community tetra tanks after I do water changes . I always try to keep the pH stable and as close to 7 . 0 as possible .####[([3], [1], 'POS')]
