[ia] The Balm Mary - Lou Manizer comes in a compact with a mirror . The product is very luminizing almost to the point of being too much . A little goes a very long way . This compact should last at least a year . I am very fair with a cool complexion and in my opinion I believe that this product is not really the right coloring for me . It is more yellow based . It will , however , look great on warmer complexions . My compact did arrive with the product broken which was disappointing but that was all in how the item had been packaged so I will not take off a star for that .

[ia] I don 't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better . I just completed my first shave and came away loving it . The thick / stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water . A little goes a long way , I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load . A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin . After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle . It felt like menthol . This might bother some but I loved it .

[ia] I started using this toothpaste on a whim , based on rave reviews . Loved it , but felt like it was overpriced for . . . toothpaste . So I went back to regular toothpaste ( Colgate , Listerine , Tom 's ) in an effort to manage costs . Suffice to say I just bought another tube of Marvis yesterday , when I finally used up my last tube of the other stuff . There 's just no comparison in flavor and how clean my mouth feels with this toothpaste . I also find the regular brands have a horrible sweetness that I can 't stand (even Tom 's , which is the least offensive ) .

[ia] I bought this product to add shine to my damaged hair . If you have used silk infusion before by CHI the horrendous smell will be familiar . I do like that the product is also a TP for flat ironing purposes but you must use this VERY lightly or your hair will be an oil slick . I have very thick hair so for me to say this you know it is oily ! I do get great shine when using this product BUT I do not like that you can only use this before flat ironing or blow drying . It isn 't the type of spray you can utilize just to get shine , it is just too greasy . I was hoping for both options . In any case if you want say "shine on the go " you will need something like bumble and bumble or another type of shine mist that is lighter . I do enjoy the results but not as versatile as I would like ! ps .

[ia] This is one of the best skincare products I 've ever tried . In late 2013 I went for a facial . It was a first -ever manual face treatment that impressed me by an immediate effect . I went back a couple of times and at the beginning of 2014 bought all the products that esthetician used on my face . Four years later this is only the product I swear by . I 'm 38 years old and I don 't have any smile lines around my eyes . People tell me that it 's impossible that I 'm that old . My eyes don 't have wrinkles ! Since the age of five , I always had under eye bags and circles . I 've tried many skin care products , but nothing was making the difference , except this serum (and Chanel Beauty Initiale - discontinued ) .

[ia] It initially does appear to give your hair a fuller look . However , on closer look , it mainly falls to the scalp .

I have a slightly fuller head than typical guys that are looking at this product , but my hair is thin , and my scalp does show in brighter lighting . I was hoping this product could disguise that .

[ia] This is my favorite body wash of all time . I love how my skin feels , the scent of it and that it comes in non -breakable bottles but , it is not available to purchase anymore . These last few bottles I was able to purchase were ridiculously overpriced yet , I still bought them . I don 't understand why the company stopped making this product and would love to find something similar to replace this as my everyday body wash .####[([5, 6], [4], 'POS'), ([0], [12, 16], 'POS'), ([19], [12], 'POS'), ([29], [27, 28], 'POS'), ([36, 37], [34, 35], 'NEG'), ([41, 43], [50, 51], 'NEG'), ([65], [66, 67], 'NEG')]

[ia] I really liked this perm . It is easy to use and not as messy as the others . If you was 'doing it yourself ' you could tell where you was at on the curlers , because of the foam . I have thin , fine , naturally curly hair . Because my hair is so thin and fine , I wanted this perm mainly for body . It worked really well for what I wanted . Unfortunately I can 't find it now . Hope I can find it again . I would recommend it to anyone . ( When I had my hair stylist used this perm , they was amazed at how easy it was to use . )####[([5], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([0], [9, 11], 'POS'), ([0], [13, 18], 'POS'), ([0], [71, 73], 'POS'), ([0], [94, 96], 'POS')]

[ia] Love this . I can 't find it in the makeup stores . It feels really good on my lips . Other glosses cause my lips to become dry , especially on the edges of my lips .

[ia] Found this stuff in Japan and wondered if I could find it again . 3drops of it goes as far as a handful of normal soap , it stays foamy and soapy and has a nice scent !####[([0], [29, 32], 'POS'), ([37], [36], 'POS')]
[ia] I am so disappointed that Avon discontinued this item because this is a great cleanser . Scents are great , love the particles for cleansing and the fact that it does not break my skin out like many of the heavily perfumed items from the Body shop and Bath & Body Works . Great stuff , wish I could buy it buy the case ! Thanks for Amazon sites still offering it !####[([15], [14], 'POS'), ([17], [19], 'POS'), ([23, 25], [21], 'POS'), ([0], [31, 36], 'POS'), ([55], [54], 'POS')]
