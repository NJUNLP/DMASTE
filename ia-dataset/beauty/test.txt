[ia] I am a 28 yo male and I use many Jack Black products because of their commitment to nature , science , and more importantly men 's skin . I use the Protein Booster Skin Serum , Energizing Scrub , Double Duty Lotion , and now this night cream . It provides instant hydration without leaving behind an oily residue . I used to use Zirh Rejuvenate as my night cream and that worked well but it is harder and harder to find Zirh in stores or online anymore . The Jack Black Dry Erase Ultra Calming cream is just what it says it is . It provides moisture and calms the skin after even the harsher and cheaper face washes . Combine this with the Protein Serum and Double Duty Moisturizer for day use and you have a comprehensive day /night regime that provides your skin with the ant drying and ant aging moisture it needs .####[([0], [52, 60], 'POS'), ([0], [108, 109], 'POS'), ([0], [111, 113], 'POS')]

[ia] This hot tools probably works great on longer hair . Mine is too shot for this product (its down to my shoulders ) . It gets very hot very fast so be careful . I liked the long , easy swivel cord , makes it easy to wrap your hair around the barrel . Also the end of the barrel has a safe non thermal tip so you don 't have to worry about burning your fingers . The hair is held tightly and there are even spring clips that are added in the package .

[ia] The actual polish is a little thicker than what I 'm used to from other brands but the results are so much better than any other brands . I love the color saturation and overall quality of the polish ! You just have to learn to put on light thin coats and add more layers as you go . Don 't clump on a thick layer !

[ia] Had high hopes for this Perricone product and was again disappointed . Apparently , his products do not work for me .

It also has a rather stickey feel to it after applying . If the product worked the money would not be an issue . But when it doesn 't , the money is the issue .

[ia] Thank goodness for Jack Black hair products . I apologize for bragging , but my hair looks great and it doesn 't smell like icky perfume .

[ia] I 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff . When it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap . This stuff is no different . Proraso is a very good shaving product . It doesn 't have the variety of scents that other soaps /creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low -frills product . The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort . It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick . It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm . The only gripe I have is the scent . I don 't particularly care for the soapy scent . It 's not bad , I just wouldn 't wear it as a cologne . Of course , smell is completely subjective . Like most all soaps , the scent doesn 't linger for more than a few minutes anyway . Overall , the soap performs great . There 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months . It performs as well as TOBS , but 25 % less expensive .####[([34], [64], 'POS')]

It didn 't work well for my hair type , which is naturally soft and hard to style . It left my hair soft but really too soft . I found it was difficult to style no matter how many styling products I used . I ended up giving it away after a few uses .

[ia] Toile is a gorgeous , bright pinky coral shade that is very pigmented but easy to sheer out on the cheeks . Unfortunately I do not get the wear out of this that some other reviewers do . I 've yet to find a blush that wears for more than a couple of hours on me though , and I suspect this has to do with my very oily skin . That said it does wear longer than most other blushes on my skin . The packaging of this is cute but makes me nervous because it is so lightweight and the product inside is heavy .

[ia] I REALLY want to love this drying lotion as so many other users do . I bought this expecting my breakouts to magically disappear overnight . When I received it , it was definitely shaken so I 'm wondering if that has something to do with it not working . After letting it settle , I dab it on any trouble areas using a q tip . You have to go down into the pink stuff at the bottom . I will say , I like the smell . It makes me feel like its doing the job . It also burns a little after I apply it . Then I typically go to sleep (hoping I don 't run into anyone in the middle of the night - it leaves little pink /white spots on your face ) and wake up in the morning and wash my face as usual . So far , it hasn 't been working that well . I 'm reading others ' reviews with the hope that maybe I 'm doing something wrong .

It 's been a while since I bought it and still have it in my purse .

[ia] Typically , CND is known for high quality and this polish did not come close to meeting my expectations . The color is not pretty whatsoever , so I have to use an additive or another polish over the top to transform the color .

[ia] It does clean but it rolls in your hand and is kind of awkward to use . And I did not really feel my face was clean so I used a cleanser after .

The product I 'd most brag about . . .the Vitamin C Serum . . . .it keeps me looking much younger than I am and is the most effective product I 've ever tried for keeping my Melasma at bay .

[ia] I love CND products . . .all of them ! ! ! The "Vexed Violette " color is a light grayish plum color (this is not a grape purple color ) .

[ia] While it is expensive , it 's the only sunscreen I 've used that feels more like moisturizer than sunscreen . Not greasy at all . Great for wearing under makeup .

[ia] I tried this shampoo after using the Awapuhi shampoo and this one is much better IMO . My hair is baby fine and tends to get oily after one day even though I am 29 years old . I wanted a shampoo that could help my hair feel clean , voluminous ,and didn 't harm animals . This product has everything I need . It has a coconut smell but its not bothersome - coming from someone who doesn 't care for coconut scents . It 's lather is less soapy than the Awapuhi and has more of a thick lather . I like it more because it makes my hair feel clean within any greasy build up . It also helps my hair feel less oily over time . I purchased the one liter because it is 3 times the product of the smaller bottle you find at Target and roughly twice the price so it 's a better deal . The standard bottle lasts around 2 months with daily usage . This bottle will probably last half the year ! I also support the cruelty free stance of Paul Mitchell and his products are some of the best in that market . Other vegan products have made my hair feel dull and just sit on my head without cleaning my hair . This product gets the job done without the guilt !####[([4], [14, 16], 'POS'), ([42], [53, 56], 'POS'), ([59], [60, 63], 'POS'), ([69], [72, 73], 'POS'), ([88], [90, 91], 'POS'), ([101], [97, 100], 'POS'), ([0], [109, 113], 'POS'), ([0], [122, 127], 'POS'), ([161], [160], 'POS'), ([195], [197, 200], 'POS'), ([226], [227, 230], 'POS')]

[ia] This gel nail polish stays put for three weeks , or more when used with base and top coat . I have kept it on without changing for three weeks . I changed only then because my nails needed filing and new growth was visible . You also need to set polish with uv light sold here at Amazon . I love it . No chips at all . This stuff is indestructible . I wash my hands numerous times daily in addition to using hand sanitizer multiple times . Nothing breaks this stuff down . Nails look the same the 21st day as the 1st day . Only takes a total of 30 minutes per manicure . Salons charge $ 40 or more for gel nails .

[ia] When I saw a hint of dryness under my eyes compared to the rest of the face , I went straight for this product because of the hyaluronic ingredient in this cream . Yes , it hydrates the skin very well , but not with satisfaction . The cream is thick , heavy , and doesn 't absorb very well . If I happened to get too much , I couldn 't do anything else but to smear it out more to other areas of the face . There were some mornings I woke up and the skin underneath the eye lashes was so itchy , but I wasn 't 100 % sure if the eye cream causes it . Another lesson to learn from this product is that eye cream lasts very long because I use very little st a time , so I should never buy the jar package again as it 's not very sanitary over a long period of time . After 3 months and the jar was still almost full ! !####[([0], [37, 41], 'POS'), ([0], [44, 46], 'NEG'), ([49], [51], 'NEG'), ([49], [53], 'NEG'), ([49], [56, 60], 'NEG'), ([150, 151], [156, 164], 'NEG'), ([171], [173, 175], 'NEU')]

It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends ) way stronger and shinny without being oily ! It 's really fantastic .

[ia] I usually use natural skin care products as much as possible , but two weeks ago my dermatologist burned off some pre -cancerous areas on my hand , and she recommended that I get the Aquaphor "in a tub " to heal them . ( I couldn 't find any explanation online as to whether or not the tub version was different than the tube version , but figured I just buy this big tub since it was more cost -effective . ) Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon , I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas , which wasn 't really doing much . As soon as I started using the Aquaphor , I noticed a big difference in how my skin was healing . This tub is huge , especially since you only need a tiny bit of this . I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house . It seems to have a ton of uses ; I 've been applying it not only on those patches on my hand , but also on dry areas on my face (a result of using Carac cream to remove pre -cancerous patches also ) , on my lips , on my heels at night , and also on my cuticles .

I highly highly recommend this to all new moms !####[([25, 26], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([0], [34, 38], 'POS'), ([0], [40, 44], 'POS'), ([0], [48, 50], 'POS'), ([0], [87, 89], 'POS')]
[ia] Umm smells yummy , fresh fruity not overly sweet , perfect for fall time . This is a very mild scrub good for daily use with nice creamy suds .

[ia] I have very thin very broken bleached hair . This product has changed my world ! I can actually comb through my hair when I get out of the shower . Leaves hair soft and healthy . Love it ! !

[ia] The swatch in the photo is wrong , but I received exactly what I ordered , and SO fast ! Aubergine Queen # 530 is a beautiful plum with a tiny bit of silver flake . It 's gorgeous , too bad it was d /c 'd . . .thank goodness for Amazon !####[([0], [12, 15], 'POS'), ([0], [18, 19], 'POS'), ([21, 24], [27], 'POS'), ([0], [39], 'POS')]
[ia] I read that sponges need to be changed once a month . . . This product combines a body wash and sponge in one ! The skin feels so clean each time I used it ! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation . To prolong its life , I first wash my hair (my body gets wet ) turn off the water and scrub /soap -up my whole body with the Spongelle . Once done , I simply rinse off with the shower . This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle 's useful life -span . About a month and a half after first use , I start adding some of my favorite body wash . And after three months I replace it with a new one .####[([0], [27, 30], 'POS'), ([39], [40, 44], 'POS'), ([97, 98], [96], 'POS')]
[ia] Loved the products however did think it was priced a little high wanted to get the lotion but the price with shipping and handling was way too much !####[([3], [1], 'POS'), ([0], [9, 12], 'POS'), ([20, 24], [26, 28], 'NEG')]
[ia] Been using this for years . Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single . I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts , frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days . Don 't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone .####[([0], [1, 5], 'POS'), ([0], [7, 9], 'POS'), ([0], [61, 66], 'NEG'), ([0], [52, 56], 'NEG')]
[ia] I decided to purchase this for my husband as part of a gift because I love the " Invigorating Tibetan " version of this and it 's every bit as gorgeous as the Tibetan shower gel but much milder and more on a light floral note whereas the Tibetan is more of a strong cologne scent . Very nice for baths before bedtime .####[([19, 20], [16], 'POS'), ([0], [31], 'POS'), ([0], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([0], [44, 46], 'POS'), ([0], [58, 59], 'POS')]

[ia] The scent is incredible & its a fantastic moisturizer . I 'm not a fan of the shimmer / glitter but its pretty subtle .

[ia] This soap has a very pleasant smell , but most importantly it is very concentrated and so you don 't need to use as much soap ( saving you money and resources ) . I used this for medical reasons (jock itch ) and found that the tea tree solution helps . However Tea Tree is often very costly and to be able to buy this in bulk at such a good value . . . I would strongly recommend .####[([7], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([26], [14, 15], 'POS'), ([26], [28, 32], 'POS'), ([48, 50], [51], 'POS'), ([73], [72], 'POS'), ([0], [79, 80], 'POS')]

[ia] I 'm giving this three stars because it does work but the results do not justify the price . I 've been using this for over two months . Before I started I couldn 't even get my lashes on a curler . They were that short . Within two and a half weeks I could see a difference . Within a month I could get my lashes on a curler . This product did make my eyelids itchy . No irritation in my eye though when I accidentally got some in it . I also noticed a weird looking line above my lashes that is lighter than the rest of my skin . I 've used this as directed . I did see improvement but I think there is a natural plateau to the length and amount of eyelashes that one 's DNA will allow . I 've hit mine . Overall a good product but I can 't see spending the money on it again ( I got mine for 60 % off and still can 't justify it ) .####[([0], [9, 10], 'POS'), ([0], [5, 6], 'NEU'), ([0], [13, 18], 'NEG'), ([74], [75, 79], 'NEG'), ([0], [81, 85], 'POS'), ([0], [123, 125], 'POS'), ([156], [155], 'POS'), ([156], [159, 164], 'NEG')]
[ia] We use this in our corporate fitness shower stall . Refill the wall mounted dispenser . No surprises if you are use to using tea tree as it doen 't suds up like normal soaps nor leave a soapy residue on the skin . Perfect for our use in shower .####[([25, 26], [17, 24], 'POS'), ([0], [36, 43], 'POS'), ([0], [45, 50], 'POS')]
[ia] good soap . I have skin allergies and am having trouble with mass produced soaps . So far so good and my skin feels great .####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([0], [23, 25], 'POS')]
[ia] This body wash smells amazing . Let me see how to describe " amazing " as a scent . It smells like you just showered in a botanical garden on a beautiful spring day . Plus your skin feels silky smooth thereafter .####[([4], [5], 'POS'), ([18], [14], 'POS'), ([0], [36, 42], 'POS')]
[ia] I continually get compliments on how wonderful I smell whenever I have used this product - especially when using it with the body lotion . I bought this product at Bath and Body during one of their annual sales a year ago and now they no longer carry it . However , other dealers have it online for $ 45 and the lotion for $ 45 up to 95 ? I don 't know why Bath & Body stopped selling it .####[([9], [2, 4], 'POS'), ([9], [7], 'POS')]

[ia] Everything about Kerastase is fantastic ! ! The Chrome Riche line promotes healthy shiny hair . Love it ! ! I also buy Kerastase Fusio - Dose Systeme Professionnel .

[ia] Wow now this is a bar of soap ! ! This bar is a VERY . . .very large 12 . 3 oz sized of soap . The scent is light and I have purchased many Pre De Provence bar soaps over the years .

[ia] This gel uses what feels like small seeds as the scrubbing particles . but there are too few of them to be of any real help as a body scrub . As a cranberry -scented , foaming body wash , it 's out of this world heavenly ! Just so luscious it makes me hungry just smelling it . It 's also thick and makes a LOT of lather with only a minor amount of the gel on a bath sponge . At this price , if you like cranberry -scented B & B products , this will more than meet your standards .####[([11, 12], [5, 8], 'POS'), ([0], [17, 26], 'NEG'), ([37, 39], [43, 46], 'POS'), ([37, 39], [47], 'POS'), ([0], [50, 51], 'POS'), ([0], [53, 57], 'POS'), ([0], [63], 'POS'), ([69], [65, 67], 'POS'), ([90, 95], [89], 'POS'), ([0], [98, 103], 'POS')]
