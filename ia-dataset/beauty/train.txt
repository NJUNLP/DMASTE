[ia] Dermatologists recommend a mineral sunscreen such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide . The older generation sunscreens with zinc oxide used to leave a thick white paste on the skin , similar to the look of diaper cream . Obagi Nu - Derm however has a thin , almost fluid consistency and just about disappears on the skin if you rub it in for about 10 seconds . There is a very faint powder scent . The special smooth zinc formula is called Z -COTE , a trademark of BASF Corp . This sunscreen is also great if you tend to have acne breakouts after wearing sunscreen , because zinc oxide is great at preventing acne . According to dermatologist Rebecca Tung , "Its main beneficial properties relative to the skin include being an antioxidant , as well as being anti -inflammatory and antimicrobial . Studies have suggested that zinc may reduce acne -causing bacteria counts , and that it may also reduce sebum and oil production .

[ia] My face is way too sensitive - it loves to make my life miserable with its "acne parties " . Most cleansers (esp foaming ) dry me out and lead to more acne . This smells so fresh and is fairly gentle (for me ) . Cleans my oily skin well , mildly chemically exfoliating . Once in a while I 'll just leave it on my face for 20 min before rinsing . For the first time in years my skin is clear and glowing - thanks to this product as well as others from MB . I like the toners , rose oil , rose spray . Don 't like the MB stuff specifically formulated for acne (not just MB I think all acne products are too aggravating ) .

[ia] The Elta sunscreen products were recommended by my dermatologist . I chose this tinted one because I was hoping for a tiny bit of coverage to help even out my skin tone . Instead it went on practically clear and very shiny . I also wanted some sunscreen protection for the delicate eye area . I could not use this anywhere near my eyes because it burned like crazy and I had to wash it off after about 10 minutes . I tired it a second time and the same thing happened . Also I was disappointed when I read in the instructions that for it to be effective for sunscreen protection you need to reapply it every two hours .

[ia] For starters this product definitely does everything everyone raves about . It is an excellent light coverage on my skin (which goes between fair and medium depending on how recently I self -tanned ) and blends in seemlessly . It seems to soak in well an dI 've never had problems with it running if I workout after applying . The reason for the 1 star reduction is that I think it feels a bit chalky , almost like there is flour in it . This does not seem to effect the appearance , and the feeling fades from my face after about half an hour , so it 's not the end of the world , it 's just not my favorite feeling .####[([4], [6, 10], 'POS'), ([17], [15], 'POS'), ([17], [16], 'POS'), ([17], [36, 38], 'POS'), ([0], [41, 45], 'POS'), ([0], [87, 93], 'NEU')]

[ia] My hair is naturally curly but has been thinning for several years . It finally reached a point where it was noticeable .

My hair is healthier and there are signs things might be getting better . However , the process takes too long so I wanted something in the meantime that I could use to help me regain my confidence . I found it in Toppik . So easy to use and the results are immediate . I even went out in windy weather and wasn 't afraid that my thin spots would show . Whether or not the Minoxidil works , I know I can use this product for as long as I want and no one , not even my husband , notices !

A little goes a long way , I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load . A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin . After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle . It felt like menthol .

[ia] This is an effective deep cleansing shampoo . With this shampoo I would really recommend that you first wash your hair with a cheaper shampoo then follow with this .

[ia] This is a great CC cream for everyone , but most especially for those w / oily or combo skin . I 've tried lots of good CC creams , including the infamous beauty -blogger favorite by IT Cosmetics . . .which I do love , but you end up TOTALLY slick later in the day if you have an oily T -zone or combo skin . With Dr . T 's SuperGoop , my skin stays a bit more matte which makes touch -ups possible , rather than impossible as they mostly are w / the IT Cosmetics version (you can 't touch up a total oil slick ! ) . I am fair , however , I use the medium -dark and it 's fine - it provides me a bit of color without overdoing it . This product goes on easily , without being oily and without being tacky where it drags across your skin . I put some powder over it and my skin just looks flawless .

[ia] This is the most awesome product I have ever used . Have been using this product for over 20 years . . . Yes over 20 years . Gentle and great exfoliating .

[ia] Love this stuff . I received a sample of the peach color and I don 't wear much peach but I liked it enough to try the pink . The color is light pink , almost like a soft pink -rose . If I put a thin coat on then it 's lighter and if I want slightly more pigment I use 2 coats . Feels great on my lips . I apply every few hours . This is not a thick lipstick and it 's not a gloss . It 's a sheer color that can deepen and slightly change after you put it on . Good for those who like lighter pinks . Goes very well with JI blush in : Cotton Candy and Awake - both of which I wear with this lipstick . Going to get the red next .

[ia] Pro : Whitens and brightens my natural nail tips . Looks really nice by itself . Con : Bright nail tips really show through color polish and look horrible . HORRIBLE . Pro : Quite a good basecoat - - keeps polish firmly in place and makes nails strong while in use . Con : It really doesn 't fill in ridges very well . It does make nails somewhat smoother but nothing to write home about . Additionally , my bottle is gloopy and it tends to pool on the sides , making my polish colors uneven .

[ia] I expected this to be a little better . I suppose I had high hopes based off my previous experiences with buying various products of this brand . The lotion smells good and mostly rosy at first , but then really dwindles down quickly to just a perfume smell and not like roses at all . All of the scent goes away rather quickly , though , too . The moisturization was not as much as I expected either . Usually Loccitane lotions and creams are very rich and long lasting on the skin . This one wasn 't like that , even my hands felt dry after just an hour or two , which is very unusual for the brand . I buy a lot of their body products , as well as face and eye creams . They 've always been very luxe feeling on the skin . . . very rich , very moisturizing , etc . I do realize this one is called a body milk , which typically does indicate a lighter lotion , but I guess I just didn 't expect it to be this light . I will use it up , but I will continue my search for a rose scented body cream or lotion . This bottle is very cute with a little gold colored flip top opening . It will be hard getting the lotion out once the bottle gets low .####[([0], [2, 8], 'NEG'), ([30], [31, 32], 'POS'), ([0], [34, 37], 'POS'), ([0], [42, 49], 'NEG'), ([0], [51, 55], 'NEG'), ([60], [61, 64], 'NEG'), ([71], [73, 78], 'NEG'), ([0], [104, 113], 'NEG'), ([216], [218, 219], 'POS')]

[ia] I was given the MD SolarSciences SPF 50 Tinted Beauty Balm in my Birchbox and I loved it . It absorbed well and you couldn 't really notice the tint ; I was able to wear an illuminating moisturizer over it without it feeling too heavy or greasy . The only reason I purchased this was because it was cheaper and the quantity was slightly more . I do like this although it is " slightly " more slippery . . . . . . It covers well , absorbs well (after about 5 minutes ) . If you don 't rub it in well , it can leave you looking white . I may go back to the tinted beauty balm : haven 't really decided . This doesn 't make me breakout and overall was a great purchase and I don 't regret it but if you tried the tinted beauty balm and expect this to be the same , it is not !

I also should say that I have very sensitive skin and have tried everything from Erno Laszlo and Chanel (both brands I LOVE ) , to CeraVe (also good , but this is better ! ) This is probably more hydrating than $ 80 Solution 10 de Chanel and $110 pHelityl Night Cream .

[ia] white pencil is matte , not super creamy . stays on my water line all day .it fades a little but still visible by the end of the day . looks great with blue eyeshadows . easy to draw the line , i do 2 or 3 passes . it is not too soft so it doesn 't crumble , which is great , will last a long time . the color is true bright white .

[ia] I purchased some Replenix product samples from Amazon just to try this brand for the first time . It 's very hard to tell just from a sample if a retinoid based product works , but this serum has a good formula and few straightforward ingredients . The sample packet is quite generous , I spread it out even on my neck , shoulders and chest , not just my face . It 's a thick serum , with an earthy scent and an brownish orange color . Even if it 's thick , it was absorbed quick into the skin . After application my skin felt tight . I applied it under my eyes as well , no irritation occurred and I have sensitive eyes . I use retinoids 3 - 4 times a week already , so my skin is used to them . I followed with my moisturizer , even on my combination skin it didn 't provided enough hydration . My skin was plumper in the morning , but most good serum do that .####[([38], [41, 42], 'POS'), ([38], [45, 46], 'POS'), ([49, 50], [52, 53], 'POS'), ([77], [76], 'POS'), ([82], [81], 'NEU'), ([87], [85, 86], 'NEU'), ([0], [97, 101], 'POS'), ([0], [105, 108], 'POS'), ([0], [119, 121], 'POS'), ([0], [165, 171], 'NEG')]

[ia] It 's a very pretty color , and it has smooth application . I put 3 very thin coats on and my nails look flawless . In sunlight , the silver shimmer is very beautiful , but still subtle . It 's a very summery feminine polish . The color looks like a shimmery less pastel version of Coral Reef by Sally Hansen . I painted my nails with Sunday Funday last night and they haven 't chipped 24 hours later . Usually I chip polishes fast because my nails are in awful condition from school , work , guitar , and piano . But it 's held up so far with a top coat . Definitely in my top 5 favorite polishes out of the 50 -something I have . On a side note , the polish arrived very fast , a day before the shipment stated . The polish was properly wrapped in bubble wrap and then put into paper packaging that was encased with bubble wrap as well .####[([6], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([12], [11], 'POS'), ([0], [23, 25], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [34, 35], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([47], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([47], [46], 'POS'), ([50], [54], 'POS'), ([0], [76, 81], 'POS'), ([0], [108, 111], 'POS'), ([123], [120, 122], 'POS'), ([139], [140, 141], 'POS'), ([147], [143, 145], 'POS'), ([163], [166, 171], 'POS'), ([0], [153, 157], 'POS')]

[ia] I can remove everything on my face with one cotton round + a bit of this water . The little cotton round is filthy by the end . At first I didn 't use a cotton round . I would put some of this in my hands and massage it onto my face . I thought it would be a waste to put it on something - -that the something would absorb all the product . Rather , the waste was splashing this on my face . It says you don 't have to wash it off your skin , and sometimes I don 't . Sometimes I just splash my face once or twice after with some warm water . It 's a nice fast way to remove foundation , brow product , eye shadow + mascara . . .

[ia] I 've been a Lorac user for quite some time , and recently decided to try their matte eyeshadow . The only negative is the pallette does not include an applicator brush , which it should .

[ia] I LOVE this stuff I mean it has finally set me free from having to shower EVERY morning . Let me stress that I have tried so many other dry shampoos and it did not help or made my hair feel gross . I bought this the first time to give a try when I was traveling for almost 24hrs my hair would get so oily and a little bit of this was all I needed . I have dark hair and the powder is white so yes if you use a lot you can see it a little bit , however if you take a few min to work it in you cant see it anymore ! It is a little pricey but for me it is well worth it , I NEVERRRR thought I would be able to go a day or 2 without washing my hair and looking disgusting and was so jealous of all my friends who were able to do that but now I can ! Saves me so much time in the morning not having to blow dry and style every day . It 's a really light weight powder and almost has a bit of grit in the powder which makes my hair feel clean and freshened while giving it lift . In my opinion this is what makes it better then any other because it does more then soak up oil .####[([4], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([4], [10, 18], 'POS'), ([0], [74, 76], 'POS'), ([0], [121, 123], 'NEG'), ([0], [172, 176], 'POS'), ([196], [193, 195], 'POS'), ([206], [199, 204], 'POS'), ([201, 203], [208, 214], 'POS'), ([0], [234, 239], 'POS')]
[ia] This is seriously a spray that you need . I have combination skin . During summer I get very oily and I need to moisturize my skin before applying makeup .

[ia] I have recently started using this BB cream and I really like it . It makes my skin look much better very even and smooth , plus it feels incredibly light and silky going on . Most impressively , it really blends away your pores somehow . It only comes in two shades Fair / Light and Light /Medium . I bought the Light /Medium although I am pretty fair and it blends in perfectly . The only drawback is that it does not seem to absorb any oil despite the description and needs to be set with powder .

[ia] These wipes are great . They are soft , gentle and have a very mild baby scent . After my daughter would finish eating , I would wipe her face with other wipes and her face started drying it so much . I ended up switching to these wipes and her face no longer is dry and is nice and soft . They are definitely expensive so I wouldn 't really use them as regular wipes past the first couple of weeks of a baby 's life . I used these in between baths when she was really tiny to freshen her up and they worked wonderfully for that purpose too . We always have these wipes in the house and the only reason I am taking off a star is that I would love for it to come with the snap top like the picture but it comes with an adhesive top that doesn 't really work great at keeping shut .

[ia] I have literally been on a retinol for 30 years ! !

My acne has since gotten much better but I remain on a retinol for its anti -aging benefits . I find this product to be very good . There are different levels so if you have not used a retinol you may want to step down and use the .25 or .50 and work your way up . I find I have very little redness or irritation with this , which can be a problem for retinoids in general . There are lots of retinol products on the market anymore but I think for the price point and quality of this particular one you simply can 't beat it . I am 46 years old and people tell me everyday that I don 't have a single wrinkle on my face .

[ia] I 'd been looking for a scented candle with some serious fragrance heft ; a great throw to really add to my whole (small ) house . This does the trick . It burns cleanly and has a clean , crisp scent . There are light floral overtones but "champagne " would not be far off . The candle comes in a hefty presentation box that I 'd be proud to give as a gift for a shower or celebratory event . The glass container , usually a throw away in items like this , is really special . I very much want to keep it for household use after the candle is done . Pretty with an artisan flair . I want to add a note : the instructions say to burn the candle to the edge the first time you light it as that will afford a smooth burn all the way down . The estimated time to get to that stage was given as 2 - 3 hours . I have had this candle burning for 5 hours and cannot get that full circumferential burn .

[ia] Application is the same as any other nail polish , the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me ( I am VERY hard on my nails ) .

I like the fact that I can change my polish weekly without dedicating an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to UV rays . The color selection is fairly vast with this product .

[ia] This is perhaps my favorite OPI polish . It is made up of halogen dots sprinkled all over a base coat which is mostly clear and like most of OPI sparkly polishes it can be worn over any other polish (as a topcoat ) or several coats all on it 's on .

[ia] 7 / 22 /2015 I 'm so pleased with this product , I bought a tube . The original tube lasted one year . I 've been using wrinkle /fine line reducer products for a couple of years now , so I didn 't expect that the StriVectin would be able to make anymore of a difference , but it did . It has worked particularly well on my neck and forehead wrinkles , making them much less noticeable . The lines around my eyes have also improved . I expect that if I hadn 't already been using other products , there would have been a greater improvement . I like that this product has no artificial color or added fragrance . It does have a bit of a minty smell , but it 's hardly noticeable and dissipates quickly .

[ia] I absolutely LOVE Vinylux because it does exactly what it says it does - lasts for a week . I always precede it with OPI BondAid and then finish with Vinylux Top Coat . However , this looks absolutely pink which is what I wanted . It isn 't anywhere near pink , not in the vicinity of pink , and not even a nodding acquaintance with pink . It 's a dusky transparent lilac . If you want it to be opaque , coat your nails three times and it looks great . But it 's not pink ! I want pink ! I 'm keeping this however , b /c I was going to look for a shade like it soon anyway . It does last a week , and it looks beautiful .

[ia] This color isn 't as bright on , but nevertheless , I still like the green .

[ia] First of all , let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff . I gave this 3 stars because IMHO , it doesn 't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes . I have a tube of Proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave . Also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather . I did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 -step process which I don 't want to do . I 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl . And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in -between . It 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream . It 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you wouldn 't need to wipe any residue off your hand .####[([12], [11], 'POS'), ([0], [18, 19], 'NEU'), ([0], [24, 28], 'NEG'), ([0], [120, 122], 'POS'), ([129, 131], [134, 138], 'NEG'), ([0], [199, 202], 'POS'), ([0], [186, 192], 'POS'), ([0], [206, 208], 'POS')]

[ia] I recently got the worst adult acne on my back and face I have ever had . I apply this with a Q - Tip on the affected areas after either I tone with pure rubbing alcohol or witch hazel . (Usually back , chest and cheeks ) , wait 15 minutes naked then put on my pajamas and go to bed . The smell is pretty bad and my room has this smell lingering but who cares ! This really dries out active pimples and "opens up " under the skin cysts . I have noticed even when I use a little bit on a pimple not only will that pimple go down , but the surrounding areas will break out less often . Maybe it 's killing the bacteria that spreads and causes more acne ? Either way it 's DEFINITELY not a cure -all or even an overnight cure but it is consistently effective in reducing bumps and pimples and when you 're dealing with an all out attack , this helps tremendously . My only complaint is that it goes by WAAAY too fast and I have a ton of the pink stuff left at the bottom of the bottle but none of the alcohol liquid that sits on top of it . (So I have squired witch hazel and rubbing alcohol in it to make it last , it still seems to work this way ) I just ordered my second bottle .####[([65], [67, 68], 'NEG'), ([65], [75], 'NEU'), ([0], [81, 85], 'POS'), ([0], [87, 93], 'NEU'), ([0], [112, 114], 'POS'), ([0], [118, 124], 'POS'), ([0], [143, 147], 'NEU'), ([0], [156, 162], 'POS'), ([0], [175, 176], 'POS'), ([0], [184, 188], 'NEG')]

[ia] I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves . I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know . As a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice . It loads well , though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones . The scent is nice and has some staying power . The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion . Is this the best soap in the world ? Nope . Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point ? Absolutely . One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave . Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso . This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin . ) Let me just say a preshave is a must . I use an oil but you could use theirs as well . A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better . without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti -inflammatory properties .####[([36, 38], [41, 43], 'POS'), ([54], [55, 61], 'POS'), ([46], [47], 'POS'), ([64], [66, 71], 'POS'), ([74], [77], 'NEU'), ([100], [102, 108], 'POS')]

I like the green Proraso sometimes a bit better than this white and sometimes I prefer this white so I keep both on hand and alternate . I find the value of this product is simply incredible . With a badger brush I get fantastic , PERFECT lather and this product last many months before I need to order more .

[ia] jane iredale lip pencils break easily and have to be ground down quite a bit each time they need to be sharpened .

[ia] My skin gets dry and easily irritated , especially on my back and underarms . This cleansing bar is like magic . I have only been using it for two days and have already gotten relief from itchy and dry skin . After a shower , my skin no longer feels tight and itchy - it 's softer and smoother so that I don 't feel the need to use body lotion . Also , it 's gentle enough that I can use it lightly to cleanse my face without causing irritation or tightness .

The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent . This was good for me as I also don 't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells . This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint . The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously . I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor .

I read many reviews and besides wool fat soap , the Proraso comes out on top . I tried it , I love , love , love it . Smooth , silky , great lather . Buying this proves you don 't have to spend a fortune to become a wet shaver . you can buy a fine , shave ready razor , a nice badger brush and this great Proraso Soap , right here on Amazon !

Usually It takes me about an hour to blowdry and then another hour to straighten my hair but with this hair dryer I had nicely dried and styled my hair in 30 minutes !

[ia] This lip balm is a bit pricey compared to your regular every day Chapstick or Blistex tubed lip balms , but it is very good lip balm and worth the price . It heals and soothes chapped or dry lips quickly . Moisturization lasts , so you don 't have to apply it constantly . All 3 varieties are good , but I think this one is best for healing really chapped lips . Consistency isn 't too thick or shiny . It won 't make a man look like he is wearing lip gloss .

[ia] Finding a "natural " shampoo that isn 't disappointing is a challenge . They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull .

[ia] I agree with several of the other reviewers .

I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing , but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products . The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me . When I moved somewhere where it wasn 't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster . I was just lucky it didn 't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos ) .

[ia] Actually , at first I intended to order white musk 'lotion ' , not the body wash . So I ordered the wrong item without reading the description carefully . The funny thing is I USE THIS EVERYDAY . I smelled both scents of the lotion and body wash , and I prefer this one .####[([0], [36, 38], 'POS'), ([0], [53], 'POS')]

[ia] Making waves curl defining shampoo really is great for my perm . It keeps my curls nice and curly . I use it once a week usually and my perms last so much longer by using it .

I highly recommend Making Waves shampoo .####[([0], [14, 19], 'POS'), ([0], [29, 34], 'POS'), ([68, 70], [66, 67], 'POS'), ([1, 5], [8, 11], 'POS')]
[ia] I was skeptical about ordering this lotion because I didn 't think it would smell like the actual perfume . WRONG ! ! It smells exactly like the Original J ' Adore perfume .
