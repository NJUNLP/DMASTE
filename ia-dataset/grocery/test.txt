[ia] Ive loved these since i was a little kid . I grew up eating them with espresso at like 8 years old ( i guess i had an advanced pallate at sn early age lol ) id been meaning to buy these for a while snd saw them on here so i had to get them . The only thing that disappointed me was im pretty sure these used to include the square cookies with rainbow sprinkles which i didn 't see in this package . Besides that they were fresh and yummy with just the right amount of sweetness and lighter than a sugar cookie and less frosted . . .just as i remember . . .and still awesome with espresso . i added some dark and white chocolate covered cherries to the cookie plate as well which was really yummy together - everyone loved the combo .

[ia] Just back from a trip to Japan , hungry for some good nabeyaki udon , I ordered this stock . There 's got to be something better on the market . I love salt , and dashi should be salty , but not overwhelmingly so . And why sugar , let alone two or three types of sugar ? While I don 't have a problem with MSG myself , I do try to avoid it . Probably my own fault ; I should have specified "No MSG " , except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn 't be labelled somewhere ! Outside of any of this , the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base . I know if I want all of that , I need to make it from scratch , but since purchasing this I 've tried several non - MSG brands and all of them are better . Sad to say , because Ajinomoto is a venerable company , but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other , healthier brands !####[([37], [38, 45], 'NEG'), ([99], [102, 108], 'NEG'), ([118], [119, 125], 'NEG')]

[ia] I 've been using the Thai organic coconut milk for a couple years now , on and off . It is generally a good coconut milk in terms of quality and flavor , though not the best by any means . It definitely seems a little more watered down since I first remember it , when I could easily use half a can with half a cup of water and make a large batch of curry sauce . Now if I water it down with that amount , it feels like the sauce is mostly water .

[ia] This is a good tasting gluten free product that even our picky eaters enjoy . The taste isn 't the same as the Kraft version that you may have had if not Gluten Free , but it is close enough isn 't like some gluten free products where you feel you are eating something with an artificial taste . The one negative I can think of is the noodles take a long time to cook , I haven 't timed it , but would easily put it at double what a Kraft wheat version would take .####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([8], [10, 14], 'POS')]

[ia] I purchase a bag of these every few months for making boba , bubble tea at home and it never disappoints . The actual product did change to this from the original that I used to receive and it was a change for the better . The consistency of these tapiocas is better and there is less powder in the bag . To cook : Make sure that you have a pan of water at a rolling boil before adding in the tapioca or it will turn into a gooey mess Add desired amount of tapioca (you want to have about 2 times or more of water because you will boil the entire time ) Set timer for 5 minutes and stir at a rolling boil . Once the consistency of the water starts to thicken your tapioca should be cooked thoroughly , this could be a bit less than 5 minutes depending on your stove top . If you have any remaining tapioca , you can store in water (and honey or agave to sweeten ) in the fridge for about 3 days before they start to get a bit hard , to make extra and use later .####[([0], [20, 21], 'POS'), ([25], [26, 27], 'POS'), ([51], [53], 'POS'), ([0], [57, 58], 'POS'), ([0], [42, 45], 'POS')]

Not sure if I 'll get 12 months out of the order or not (need to see when I ordered it ) . Still FAR cheaper than buying it in the grocery store , or in a smaller amount .

[ia] This BBQ sauce isn 't bad . I 've had better but for the price , I can 't complain . Kraft Thick and Spicy has more of an artificial smoked flavor with a slight sweetness .

It has just the right amount of subtle spice to make it stand out from my favorite English /Irish breakfast tea . Read the other reviews for a more nuanced description . . . words fail me .

My cappuccino tastes so much better with this particular honey . The price is so affordable and much much cheaper than if I had to purchase this in a health food store . Amazon 's free super saver shipping speed is excellent .

[ia] My family loves these chips ! We can 't stop eating them once we start ! I did have a bad case once though . The chips were stuck in cluster balls . I called the company and they sent me coupons for free bags and % off of more bags . We haven 't had any problems since . Great product !####[([5], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([0], [8, 11], 'POS'), ([62], [61], 'POS')]
[ia] Bob 's Red Mill Potato Flour is a great product . I use it with other Bob products when I make my own all purpose gluten free flour . I have had a lot of success with all of his flours and starches . GF Pumpkin Pancakes are to die for .####[([6], [9], 'POS')]
[ia] I like this brand better than some other organic ones . It always seems to have more cream . I make a chocolate gluten -free cake that uses the coconut cream (with chocolate ) for icing . With this brand I only have to use the cream from two cans . With other brands that I have used , I have to open three cans to get enough cream .####[([4], [2], 'POS'), ([0], [13, 18], 'POS')]
[ia] I read about the benefits of Rooibos Tea and decided to try it , not knowing how it would taste . This is actually very tasty . Even can drink it without sweetener .####[([0], [25, 26], 'POS')]
[ia] It 's Dave 's what more needs to be said if you haven 't ever had Dave 's brand then I suggest you start with one of the more Milder you know Dave 's Insanity Sauce and work your way up to this Dave has been in the business a long time and you can count on their quality flavor and heat of their product to be right at the very top####[([59], [69, 72], 'POS'), ([60], [69, 72], 'POS'), ([62], [69, 72], 'POS')]
[ia] I ALMOST HATE TO SAY THIS . THE ORIGINAL ONLINE AD USED THE WORDS XYLITOL ' POWDER ' . THAT 'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR TO ADD TO RECIPES WHERE THE GRANULATED FORM IS TOO GRITTY AND DOESN 'T MIX AS WELL . IF YOU WERE ADVERTISING POWDERED SUGAR , YOU WOULD N 'T EXPECT TO GET GRANULATED , AND EVERYONE BASICALLY KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE . NOT LIKELY THAT Y OU 'D SPRINKLE GRANULATED SUGAR ON THE OUTSIDE OF A CAKE , FOR EXAMPLE . YOU 'D NEED POWDERED . I CAN TAKE THIS AND GRIND IT UP FOR MY PURPOSES , BUT WISH THAT IT WERE MADE MORE CLEAR . OTHERWISE , AS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT , NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROBLEM , T HERE 'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT AND THE PRICE FOR SIZE IS GREAT .####[([33, 34], [36, 37], 'NEG'), ([33, 34], [39, 43], 'NEG'), ([118], [123, 125], 'POS'), ([121], [127, 131], 'POS'), ([136], [140], 'POS')]
