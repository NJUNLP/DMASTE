[ia] A kilo of tasty rough brown sugar cubes with the slightest taste of molasses , made from cane sugar in Mauritius . Great in tea . They take a minute to dissolve but it 's worth the wait . Some people brew the tea with the sugar in the teapot . I don 't mind stirring it in the cup until I can 't hear the crunchy crystals anymore . . I can 't get this anywhere within a hundred miles so the slightly high price for Prime shipping was worth it . The only sugar I want to put in my tea .

[ia] I moved from Twinings Earl Grey tea to the Darjeeling flavor just to try something different . Not totally a great idea . Don 't get me wrong , it is my opinion that Twinings offers the best tea world wide . The switch from their Earl Grey , (which is floral smelling and leaves you with a WOW now that is a tea drinkers tea kind of flavor ) , was not my best tea decision . Darjeeling smells like lawn grass in comparison and although I got used to it and liked it after a few batches , it does not compare with Earl Grey 's flavor . I switched back to Earl Grey .

So I searched and searched and this is the only energy drink that uses Stevia instead of artificial sugar as a sweetener . The taste isn 't that bad and I drink them at room temperature . People used to sugary drinks (which I can 't stand at all ) probable won 't like the taste . But if you are use to diet drinks and can learn to like different taste this drink would be the healthy energy drink to switch too . I just wished they made Guru energy shots . WHI IS MY RATING SO LOW ? ? ? THE PRICE . . .it was $32 . .now it jumped to $50 . . .I won 't be buying anymore . . . .WHY AMAZON WHY ? ? ?####[([45, 47], [49, 54], 'POS'), ([60], [61, 64], 'NEU'), ([0], [154, 158], 'NEG')]

[ia] Excellent pepper . I have a large wooden manual grinder like in the restaurants cause i 'm a bit of a nerd about pepper and some spices . Fresh ground is the way to go . I 've tried several different brands of whole peppercorns , but this is my favorite and SUCH a great deal on price compared to the grocery store . Literally 1 / 3 of the price for what you get . The flavor is not overly pungent . I would actually say it 's more floral than spicey , but certainly has some spice to it .

[ia] I boil 4 cups of water and add oatmeal (proportions are listed on the back of the package ) , cooking it for about 15 minutes . This gives me a week 's worth of breakfasts .

[ia] Orville 's bags are 2 . 9oz , cost only 20 % less during an Amazon sale , have nearly the same calories as Bearitos , accept they come 3x more from fat than fiber , and Orville 's has Triple the sodium . Bearitos seems bland , but that 's the whole point of this product . to achieve the best fully popped natural corn without the flavorings , oils , and salt of everything else on the market . If you are looking for something toned down from the fully flavored over salted stuff you buy in the supermarket , then Orville 's is great . But if you want a true minimalist diet popcorn ; this is it . Bearitos also pops up fuller , softer and larger per kernel than Orville 's does , making for an excellent filling snack when you are looking for a great 100 calorie indulgence .####[([45], [46, 47], 'NEU'), ([125], [127], 'POS'), ([125], [129], 'POS'), ([125], [131], 'POS'), ([123], [142, 144], 'POS')]
