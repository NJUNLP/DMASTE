[ia] Just adding my two cents - I 've tried some other packing tapes for mailers , and they aren 't very good . Despite the sometimes awkward use of the dispenser with the Scotch brand , it really does seem to be the best . The price certainly helps . And Amazon making it an add on item is sheer brilliance , since buying this in the 6 or 12 pack case seems excessive . I sell items via Amazon often (one or two per week on average ) , so I do use a fair amount of this tape .####[([0], [38, 44], 'POS'), ([47], [48, 49], 'POS'), ([52], [56, 61], 'POS'), ([31], [26, 28], 'NEG')]

[ia] After years of buying - -and replacing - -the under $ 20 sharpeners for my classroom , I splurged and am so glad I did . First , it 's a write -off as it is being used entirely in my classroom .

(And yes , that will get old quickly . ) With 125 students in my room per day , this sharpener has been working over time . And four months later , it 's still going strong .

The Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad is everything I could possibly want . The gel is nice and squishy and molds easily to my wrist . It is the perfect height when I 'm using the mouse . My mouse glides easily on the pad . I really can 't imagine using any other mouse pad from now on . . . I 'm just that pleased .

[ia] This is my first space pen . I love it . It writes great , and reliably even on difficult surfaces like sketching on wet cardboard beer coasters ( A situation I find myself in from time to time ) .

[ia] These colored pencils are not worth the money . They don 't last very long at all and they break way too often when trying to sharpen .

[ia] This pen is so much fun to write with - it flows easily and leaves nice , dark , bold strokes on the paper . As a grad student I take copious notes and needed a pen that didn 't force me to bear down hard in order to make a "good impression . " However , the deal -breaker here is that the pen leaks all over everything . When not in use ink blobs gather at the tip and , after use , I have ink spots all over my hands . Worse : this morning I spent a good half hour using alcohol to get ink spots out of my good white blouse . So . . . .if you don 't mind a mess , forge ahead .

The additional features make it even better : nice large number buttons , memorized phone numbers , last number redial , volume control . It isn 't really white , though , more of a putty -color .

[ia] So how much can you say about label tapes ? The either work or they don 't . These labels work very well for my Dymo label maker . I got the label maker and the tapes primarily to label containers that I freeze food in . Prior to this , I was using masking tape . The masking tape worked , but it always left residue that I had to scrape off . These labels stick to the container , but are easily removed without leaving any residue . I also like using the label maker for this task because I can set up a label and print up to 10 at a time . This is so much easier than manually writing on masking tape for the number of labels that I need . I also like that the backing on the labels is easy to remove . The backing is split so that you remove half at a time . This is also so much easier than the old embossed label makers that may or may not leave the little tab to pull off the backing .####[([20], [21, 23], 'POS'), ([76], [84, 85], 'POS'), ([142, 145], [147, 149], 'POS'), ([0], [167, 169], 'POS')]

[ia] I use these labels to put the dates and ages of my kids and stick them to the back of their school pictures or pictures i have taken at other studios .

The pages and entry spaces have plenty of room and if more is needed , we just continue with our preferred notations , no problems . And , this book also has spaces in the front for recording beginning and ending mileage for any given year for more than one vehicle if that information is needed . We find this book very easy at each our own year end , to utilize this book to do spread data and total summations and coded entries and however else we need to use this book to accomplish our accounting goals for record keeping .

[ia] These are so perfect for my office cubicle ! I hate sticking thumbtacks into my pictures and this allows me to hang them without putting holes through them !

[ia] I ordered the wrist bar pictured but Ace Depot opted to exchange the out -of -stock featured item for something similar , which was a soap -bar style wrist rest . I notified the vendor I really preferred the BAR style wrist rest , & a representative , Kimberly , sent a bar -style wrist rest that is very similar in shape to the one pictured . It 's a memory foam bar -style with a fabric cover . Beautiful deep navy blue color that is comfortable to type with and supports the wrist quite adequately for extended sessions of keyboard interaction . I do think the vendor should deliver products as advertised . If the product is no longer available then it might be best to drop a misleading product picture . With that said , I love the new wrist bar and consider it as a very suitable , if not better even , alternative to the gel bar pictured .####[([71, 74], [75, 78], 'POS'), ([82, 84], [80], 'POS'), ([82, 84], [81], 'POS'), ([0], [87, 90], 'POS'), ([108], [109, 113], 'NEG'), ([141, 143], [139], 'POS'), ([0], [149, 150], 'POS')]

[ia] Great sharpener while it worked . I purchased in in February of 2017 and it started failing in February of 2018 . Used three times per week , sharpening about 40 pencils per day . Adult use only . It has a two year warranty , but I can 't run a classroom while waiting on a replacement sharpener .

[ia] For the price , this product deserves 5 stars . First the cons : 1 . It 's thin . This means that the writing surface bends whenever you apply pressure to write . 2 . The clamps are rough . I expect that they will break if pushed too hard or opened with too much force . However , each of these points are to be expected with a product that is so inexpensive . The storage area is fairly large , and has space for papers and a slim tablet . The pencil area is okay , there is a protrusion into the space to accomidate the closure snap , so there isn 't a uniform space - - so you can 't store more than one bulk pen (like multipens or highlighters ) . Overall , for the price this product delivers . I do wish I had gotten something a little sturdier , but without being able to test the product , this was a good , safe bet . Overall , would recommend for light use .####[([6], [7, 9], 'POS'), ([0], [19], 'NEG'), ([25, 26], [27], 'NEG'), ([38], [40], 'NEG'), ([71], [74, 75], 'POS'), ([78, 79], [81, 82], 'POS'), ([78, 79], [85, 92], 'POS'), ([95, 96], [98], 'NEU'), ([119], [115, 118], 'NEG'), ([0], [124, 131], 'NEG'), ([144], [145], 'POS'), ([0], [170], 'POS'), ([0], [172, 173], 'POS'), ([0], [177, 181], 'POS')]
[ia] Very nice set of pens , wish there had been a different variety of colors but its basically the same as the other Sharpie sets colors very vibrant and strong .

[ia] I am very pleased with the Dymo wireless printer , and their tape are versatile and rugged . I keep expanding their uses .

[ia] I actually use these in my art journals - they are the perfect size to write a bit of journaling on ( lines are spaced about 1 / 4th an inch apart , so it 's a nice narrow rule for smaller handwriting ) but the cards are sturdy enough to take a few swipes of paint , some stamping or distressing , and some glue . I also use them for things like to -do lists , quick notes to friends , etc . I love the larger size - big enough for a substantial amount of writing , but not large enough to add bulk to your projects . I can also see these as being perfect for recipes and school projects . For reference , these are about the size of half a piece of regular printer paper , lined on one size , and regular index card /cardstock thickness .####[([14], [13], 'POS'), ([23], [38, 43], 'POS'), ([47], [49, 57], 'POS'), ([90], [87, 89], 'POS'), ([0], [92, 99], 'POS'), ([0], [119, 124], 'POS')]

[ia] I ordered this labeling tape as replacement for my DYMO label . I had to order it sooner than expected because the last roll jammed and bunch got wasted trying to fix the jam .

It happened for us at a pretty inconvenient time , as my son was trying to label his dividers for the school year . Overall , the tape works well .

[ia] These markers are almost permanent . Most cleaners , soap , detergent , etc will not remove the ink from these markers . But on smooth surfaces such as glossy plastic , some metal or painted surfaces , there are solvents that can remove the ink . I found that most orange citrus type cleaners will take this ink off , which surprised me . But in 90 % of applications the markers really are permanent .
