It 's lightweight but seems sturdy . By flipping a certain part on it , you can use it as a wall phone , or leave it as is for a tabletop phone .

[ia] globs and smears too much for me . Ink pools at the tip when you first begin to write . too much ink is deposited at the start , then it becomes better . Still , you end up with a globby beginning letter , and it you touch it , it is smear -city . not sure there is any other option .####[([0], [1, 5], 'NEG'), ([9], [10, 19], 'NEG'), ([23], [21, 22], 'NEG'), ([0], [32, 33], 'POS'), ([0], [37, 44], 'NEG'), ([0], [54, 55], 'NEG')]
[ia] This paper is perfect for flyers which is what i use it for mostly . I don 't really print photis at this size , but im sure it would perform just as well , since thats what Canon excels at . Ive also used this paper for folded direct mail flyers , and didn 't once worry that it would fall apart in the mail .####[([2], [4, 6], 'POS')]
[ia] Great pencil sharpeners . When I use them with my Prismacolor pencils , I find it best to start in the large hole and finish off the point in the smaller hole . I also find too much pressure breaks the tip . Use a light touch .####[([2, 3], [1], 'POS'), ([22, 23], [17, 19], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [25, 28], 'NEU')]

[ia] It was in the middle of last year , that I spotted this perfect planner on sale . I was not happy with the one I had . So I threw that one away and started using the new one . It had everything I needed in a planner . So this year , I looked for and found another one like it . There 's a place for notes and addresses ; birthdays , anniversaries . A place in the back to stick bills or whatever . A place to write a quick appt and a place for notes on the sides . Or if you 're like me , I like to have a bigger place to write more . This has both . And the beautiful painted pictures throughout the book brighten up my desk . Well , worth the price . I highly recommend this planner .####[([15], [14], 'POS'), ([49], [43, 46], 'POS'), ([130, 131], [129], 'POS'), ([130, 131], [135, 138], 'POS'), ([0], [142, 144], 'POS'), ([150], [147, 148], 'POS')]

[ia] I 've wanted a vanishing point for years , and finally I purchased the Black Carbonesque with a fine nib . It has a wonderful weight and writes so smoothly and looks great with a black -blue ink . The mechanism feels smooth and sturdy and has a really satisfying mechanical click . I purchased the Matte Black version for a friend , and I am green with envy after seeing it out of the box .

[ia] These cartridges fit most (or at least , my ) Dymo label printer , and work very well indeed . I gather this is thermal printing , since there 's no separate ink to worry about .

[ia] After reading several reviews , I bought this to sharpen my Prismacolor pencils and wasn 't going to take a chance at wasting them with other sharpeners !

[ia] I love Dr . Grip pens . They are great for my arthritic hands ! I go through the refills in a hurry , I use the pen so much . The best thing I can say about the refills is that they write great right to the end . Never any skipping , blurring , or any other problem ! I wouldn 't use any other brand !

[ia] Got on a lightning deal . Was a good price for so many pens . Sharpies are sharpies .

[ia] I do administrative work so I 'm sitting in my chair for at least 6 hours of my 8 hour work day . I bought a modern looking office chair which ended up being pleasing to the eye , and unpleasant to my backside . After months of trying to deal with it , I knew I had to buy a cushion . I looked through the dozens on Amazon and decided to go with this one . It blends in perfectly with my blue /black chair and feels like sitting on a cloud . It 's soft but firm enough so it doesn 't just cave in . There is a washable sleeve over the foam which makes cleaning a breeze . I 'd definitely recommend this to anyone who just wants more support for their butt /back####[([0], [80, 87], 'POS'), ([0], [89, 94], 'POS'), ([0], [98], 'POS'), ([0], [100, 101], 'POS'), ([0], [104, 108], 'POS'), ([113, 114], [119, 122], 'POS'), ([0], [126, 127], 'POS')]

[ia] Bought this for our 5 & 6 year old . Use the blue tack to stick to the walls however the roll in it makes it difficult to keep flat on the wall . Does what it is intended to do .

[ia] The most common use of this product is probably to insert a person 's business card in a portfolio . My son has a more uncommon use : he has a lot of venomous snakes and , by law , is required to label all the containers . Because he moves the snakes around and gets new ones , this pocket is perfect to move the cards accordingly . I 've printed the snake types on business card stock using large font and added the danger icon to warn at a glance . This has worked out perfectly for him .####[([61], [63], 'POS'), ([0], [96, 98], 'POS')]

[ia] This is no reflection on the actual board itself , but it did show up damaged ( one side was bent , causing the bottom corner to bow out from the wall after it was hung . I ended up taking it down , bending it back into place by hand , and it seemed to fix it without any major issues . My complaint with this board though is that it 's very hard to keep clean . Using name -brand markers and erasers , you practically have to scrub the get the dry -ease off of there . And even then , ghosting is left on the board until you get out the board cleaner and paper towels to clean if off . I know it 's not a porcelain board (which is what I 'll buy next time ) , but still , I 've never even had an issue with a melamine board being this hard to clean . I 'd avoid if you can afford to . . .####[([0], [13, 16], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], [21], 'NEG'), ([68], [74, 78], 'NEG'), ([0], [89, 97], 'NEG'), ([0], [105, 107], 'NEG'), ([133], [130, 132], 'NEG'), ([0], [164, 171], 'NEG')]

[ia] I 'm 64 , had no tools , and after some reviews , was a bit worried about putting this cart together . It was easy ! I mean , EASY ! My cart was a bit different than the photo - better . The front wheels on mine are double on each side and swivel so it 's easy to steer . I was able to bend over the cotter pins that hold on the back wheels with my fingers , and they 're fine . While I can 't imagine putting 150 # of anything in it , I have already loaded it to the top with grocery bags and stuffed more in the handy back pocket and I was able to back it up two sets of steps with no problem at all . The big back wheels are better than my old cart because they 're large enough not to get caught under the deck steps , which are open at the back and used to catch my old cart daily . There 's a plastic accordion tube over the handle that slides around a bit , but this hasn 't caused any real problem . The handle is long enough that I don 't have to bend over to pull or push the cart - and my back appreciates that !####[([0], [26], 'POS'), ([0], [31], 'POS'), ([34], [37, 41], 'POS'), ([34], [43], 'POS'), ([0], [133, 136], 'POS'), ([139, 141], [143], 'POS'), ([139, 141], [151, 160], 'POS'), ([180, 182], [187, 190], 'NEG'), ([0], [194, 199], 'POS'), ([202], [204, 205], 'POS')]

[ia] These pens . I don 't know why , but papermate flexgrip is my favorite . They write smooth , the ink comes out at a satisfying speed , and the line they make is a little thicker than the average pen . I do not spend money on pens , but when my last flexgrip ran out of ink (yes , that 's how long I had it ) I decided to splurge on these .
