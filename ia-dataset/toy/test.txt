[ia] We first encountered these in the nationally popular Music Together [ TM ] class that we enrolled our kids in our local area . We knew immediately that we had to have one . And we were overjoyed to find how cheap they are on Amazon . This is the real dealit 's a drum . As in , an actual drum that you can make actual music with , adult and child . Take it to the drum circle if you want . As a bonus , it 's durable , well -made , and designed in such a way ( colorful artwork , rubber feet , lightweight , rubber -tipped stick ) as to be kid -friendly in every way . This is light years ahead of any toystore drum (most of which are pale excuses for any sort of musical instrument , if they even manage to be that ) and for the price is an absolute steal .####[([0], [38, 42], 'POS'), ([0], [91], 'POS'), ([0], [93, 94], 'POS'), ([97], [118, 122], 'POS'), ([104], [103], 'POS'), ([107], [106], 'POS'), ([0], [109], 'POS'), ([113], [111, 112], 'POS'), ([131, 132], [126, 130], 'POS'), ([157], [160, 161], 'POS')]

[ia] This is pretty much the Operation I remember . Or at least as close as it 's going to get . Avoid the other version with the horrible reviews .

[ia] It 's a neat toy and is great for a puzzle -loving kid . But there 's no lid . Nothing to hold all those pieces in one spot . Nothing to put on top so that a young child could confidently walk it over to its spot to be put away . Nothing to cover it so that you can toss it in the car to bring on a trip whether long or short . Nothing to protect the pieces from being scattered everywhere when you forget you 've placed it on the top of the stack of books and it all comes tumbling down . Nothing to contain all the pieces when your child grows out of it and you want to donate it to a thrift store . Good luck keeping all the pieces . Other than the lid thing , it 's great .

The scoring could not be done easily by 10 years old unless they had a fair amount of help at first . I like this game because there is a lot of strategy and as the board changes , you must adjust .

The ingredients are plentiful , there are lot of different slimes to make , and they all come out looking great . Instructions are easy to follow . The only thing I 'd recommend is that , unless you 're making a bunch of different slimes on the same day , don 't make the full batch of STB and guar gum solutions that they tell you to , just halve the amounts . Because although they tell you you can save the stuff in containers for the future , they wind up losing their potency and the slime doesn 't turn out as well .

[ia] This is a really fun game . It 's got the weird cooky factor without being too gross . I play with my three year old son . It has blank cards to add my own items and we did right away . I add new things all the time . It is also easily altered to play as your child 's age dictates . Very fun ! The one thing I might say is the cards have a general idea as to what you need to pull out of neds ears , nose or mouth , but it is not an exact picture of the item . That bothered my son at first because he didn 't think he 'd found the right item . It didn 't "match " perfectly . Other than that fun game .####[([6], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([0], [10, 18], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [34, 37], 'POS'), ([0], [55, 64], 'POS'), ([0], [66, 67], 'POS'), ([0], [128, 132], 'NEG'), ([107], [101, 105], 'NEG'), ([0], [110], 'NEG')]
[ia] This has become a Christmas tradition in our house . Our kids (age 3 and 2 ) race to find Bernie - our elf on the shelf - every morning . It 's fun for me and hubby too because we love to get creative at night hiding /positioning our elf all over the house . If you don 't celebrate Santa then it probably won 't have the same excitement /meaning for you . YOu could try hiding something else - a baby Jesus or Menorah but really the kids love finding the elf because they think he is going to tell Santa what they want for Christmas . Of course , most kids love hide and seek so would find this fun even if they don 't believe in Santa . We love it .####[([0], [34], 'POS'), ([95], [91, 93], 'POS'), ([0], [135], 'POS')]

[ia] An old classic that is perfect for our 14 month old because she is able to walk it all over the house . I 'm sure we 'll be sick of the noise soon , but she absolutely loves this toy .

Unfortunately , by the end of her birthday party , the adults had gathered around the kitchen table and used up half the tub ! I felt bad , so I gave her the butterfly I had made and promised I would get her another tub .

[ia] I generally do a lot of research into the product reviews before confirming to purchase them . I chose these for the novelty concept and was very disappointed .

[ia] This is a lovely game . If it wouldn 't be so hard to dust I 'd want to display it . Cathedral is very easy to learn and has few rules . It plays in about 20 - 30 minutes and is lots of fun .

[ia] Good mix of diplomacy and risk . It 's a long game . Players should definitely allow extra time to play their first game as the game is super complex , but really good says my 20 -something son for whom I bought the game .

[ia] Bought this for my 18 month old daughter and she loves stacking the pieces and sorting the shapes and colors . The pieces are hard plastic and very lightweight . They sit on top of one another and easily fall over if accidentally touched while stacking . This would frustrate my daughter and cause her to begin crying everytime they would fall over . Will reintroduce once she 's a little older and understands it 's ok if they fall .

[ia] This mouse puppet is well -made , looks enough like a real mouse to have some educational value , and can be a fun part of children 's puppet shows . However as a puppet it 's limited .

[ia] I bought this to use in our summer 's kid -carnival party . They LOVED using it . Actually , they were fighting over who got to go next . I read several reviews before deciding which spinner to purchase , and think I really did make a good choice . This one is easy to use , has enough battery power to spin nicely (instead of hand powered ) . Of course people complain that you need to buy replacement paper /paint . But really , if your creative , make your own paint squirt bottles . Fabric paint from Michaels works good . And just save some of the cardboard as a template to cut out more paper from cardstock . One piece of advice . . . make sure you have your paint area covered nicely to prevent paint from spilling . They were so excited to show everyone their creations , that many of them ended up on my kitchen floor .

I understand that it 's inflatable , but if you plan on using it in the classroom you probably plan on having the students use it . You need something sturdier .

[ia] I did look at a number of different cribs before choosing this one . Originally I wanted a brown crib but the quality appeared to be lacking in other brands so I settled for white . On receiving this crib it was apparent that you will need 2 people to construct this however certainly someone more engineer minded could do it by themself . In any event the wood is sturdy and once built this is an impressive crib that will last for a long time . It does come with bedding which is nice and it is big enough for larger dolls . It can rock side to side but is steady enough that it won 't tip over . It was brought for a 2 year old that loves playing mommy .

She has learned how to manipulate it enough upside down with moving the wand around to make some of the liquid come out on the floor . But I don 't leave her alone long with things like this , so now she only gets supervised bubble time . I can let her hold it by herself and not worry about accidental spills like with the regular bubble jar . I use the 50 cent bubbles to refill this one , or make bubble solution myself with dish soap . I also bought the smaller type one for my 16 month old , but she usually puts the wand in her mouth when trying to blow bubbles , but she loves it too .

[ia] This product was great ! That was until we tried to put together the pig . That was when we realized that we have some duplicate pictures on some of the blocks . That means no matter how hard my daughter tries she can never get the picture to look right . So buyer beware that you might only have a few animals that your child can put together correctly . We did compare the blocks to the picture just to confirm the block mistake . I had my wife double check the blocks just to make sure . I would have rated it 4 stars except the pictures don 't all match up . I don 't know how long the blocks would hold up because the pictures are just stickers .

The harder you step on the launcher , the further it goes . Not just the kids either , the adults were having a blast with it as well . It seems very sturdy and I imagine I will need to buy replacement rockets since what comes up , must go down , and hits cement .

Quite literally the day I got this set up we had a huge rainstorm and the cover did it 's job and didn 't let any water in . This table is the perfect size for 1 - 3 kids and the toys that came with it are nice , not cheap , and they are primarily what my children use when playing with this sand table . It was nice to not have to go out and get accessories for them to use before they could enjoy this table . It holds one small bag of play sand (0 .5 cubic feet , probably roughly 25 pounds ? ) nicely and could hold a LITTLE more than that but I just put one bag in . I feel like the table is a little shallow , however my children certainly don 't seem to mind and I 'm just glad that I chose this one instead of a more traditional one that would be larger , more difficult to move , and would require my children to sit in the sand while playing .####[([3], [6], 'POS'), ([74], [73], 'POS'), ([82], [88], 'POS'), ([82], [90, 91], 'POS'), ([129], [127], 'POS'), ([0], [187, 193], 'POS'), ([56], [62, 67], 'POS')]

[ia] My grandson is a little over 2 but , I wanted him to have some fun with a slinky like I had years ago . Only his hands are too small for the original size .

[ia] There are so many versions of these "out " there ! Different colors , etc . The lady bug on the top does not spin as much as my girlfriend 's daughter 's who has the other color from Target .

[ia] Saw this game being used on a tv programme and thought it was a great idea . Reviews were a bit hit and miss and I can understand why . Takes quite a while to set up each game , squeezing the last cube into place is hard . When you turn the block over and try to bang out cubes nearly always more than one drops out . Keeping strictly to your chosen cube doesn 't make any difference . The hammers were very light so again , kids had to keep banging a cube before it would drop out . I also thought it was expensive . The product is really flimsey . Having said all this my grandkids enjoyed playing the game and trying not to knock the polar bear into the ice . Wouldn 't recommend .####[([0], [41, 48], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], [31, 34], 'NEG'), ([61], [62, 68], 'NEG'), ([83], [85, 86], 'NEG'), ([96], [91, 94], 'NEG'), ([0], [108], 'NEG'), ([111], [114], 'NEG'), ([125], [122, 123], 'POS'), ([0], [138, 140], 'NEG')]

However , the problem we have now is does not want him to go back to the North Pole . She cried for 20 min in bed xmas eve night because she didn 't want him to leave . I did not want her to be sad (when she should be super happy /excited ) so we said he could stay longer and I tried to explain he is just for fun .

[ia] Smart Mouth is the perfect name for this word game in which players must make words using the pairs of first and last letters . Though you really do not need the game pieces to play , having the tiles and dispenser helps ramdonize the letter choices and reloading the dispenser gives younger kids a kick . The instructions are clear and offer a variety of options for playing so that the game does not get stale too fast . Thought the concept is pretty neat , the game itself it poorly designed . Once you dispense a pair of tiles , you have to remove them from the base , and then you loose them - - -all over the car , the floor , the table . It would have been simple and useful just to create a bigger base for the game . The packaging is wasteful and ridiculous .

The holding tray to put the pegs was a nice idea , but it 's not big enough for all the pegs and if you put the big pegs and the little pegs in , you have to sort them each and every time you want to play the game .

I liked the added bonus of it being a fill and spill toy and saw that many reviewers commented how great it was for church . Perfect ! Well . . . it is quiet but it is NOT SILENT . Each little bird rattles (but thankfully no crinkles ) . The rattle is about the volume of the foot finder rattles so it is not too loud and I 'm hoping will work for our purpose .

[ia] I bought this for my daughter 's Easter basket this past year . I like that this toy teaches colors , shapes , and some fine motor skills . Plus , it 's a natural addition to an Easter basket . We 've had many hours of enjoyment talking about the different colors we see and the shapes we 're looking at on the bottom of the eggs , putting the eggs in the carton , taking them out , etc . I don 't like that the eggs barely "chirp . " The sound they make is really just a high -pitched squeaky noise that 's created by pushing the eggs down . Not really a chirp per say . However , for me , the educational benefits outweigh this drawback .

[ia] This puzzle is nice at the top ; however , the whale doesn 't have enough to differentiation in colors . My 3 year old can complete 48 piece puzzles alone in under 15 minutes so I wanted a challenge for him by buying 100 piece puzzle . It is a challenge but the whale takes up most the bottom side portion and it 's really the most difficult to see colors with little to no separation .

[ia] We had a neighborhood party and these were used for face painting . They just dipped these in some water and started making designs on the kids faces . The designs turned out very well and at the end of the night they also washed off pretty easily . On paper they are also easy to use , especially fun for young kids to make a pretty watercolor without all the hassle of the paintbrushes and watercolors . The other thing I like about them is they last quite a while - and for the price they are awesome ! ! I have a 4 . 5 yr old son and 2 .5 yr old daughter .

[ia] First off this item came with a foul oil all over it that had to be washed off with soap and water . Not that big an issue just nasty stuff , the problem I have is , there doesn 't appear to be any leaks but it won 't hold air for longer then 20 minutes . I 'm guessing it 's the cheap plug for the hole that leaks slowly . Yes you have to inflate this yourself . I expected this to come fully inflated and factory sealed . I also expected it to be made with a much better and thicker wall . This bouncer is made of what seems like a thicker beach ball kind of plastic . Not happy at all with it .

[ia] This was exactly what I was looking for for my 2 year old . I 've bought sand boxes , made some too , but eventually they all get disgusting . This has a cover and is at a good height for the kids to play with , without them ending up sitting in the sand .

[ia] My kiddos are 2 and 5 and they love this set . They can swing as high as they like without us worrying about it tipping over (after it 's staked ) . Assembly was a chore , only because we assembled the slide side completely before the swing add -on . The directions you get are for each piece individually so you don 't realize that the crossbeam at the top of the slide part will have to be taken apart to install the swing part . So we lost time on that . The directions were also confusing - rudimentary pictures rather than instructions . 11mo Update : Still in great shape and got through a scorching Tucson summer without fading .####[([11], [9], 'POS'), ([0], [15, 24], 'POS'), ([34], [37], 'NEG'), ([69], [78, 87], 'NEG'), ([97], [100], 'NEG'), ([106], [102, 104], 'NEG'), ([114], [113], 'POS'), ([0], [116, 123], 'POS')]

[ia] My son loves this Woody . I read a few people saying this Woody doesn 't sound like Tom Hanks , or the pull string Woody in the movie . Ours does . The phrases that Woody says in the movie ( "there 's a snake in my boot " , "Reach for the sky ! " , "Someone 's poisoned the water hole !

As mentioned in prior reviews , they are not meant to come off , and Woody doesn 't have feet , just stubs . He 's played with it for nearly two months now , and it works just as perfectly as it did when it arrived .

[ia] I bought this CD player for my 2 year old daughter because she uses all sorts of things to sing into , from spoons to sticks to my cats tail (he doesn 't appreciate that at all ) . It is true what others have said about not being able to control the volume of the microphones . They do squeal when they are close to the player as well . I had to teach my daughter to hold the microphones away from her mouth and to sit back from the player a bit , when she does those two things it works great . She really enjoys using the player . She and I , or her brother , sing together so we really like that it has two microphones . I didn 't get it for educational purposes , though she does use it to play book CD 's , I still don 't think it 's an educational toy and I don 't think they advertise it in that manner either .

[ia] I bought this for my son and the head fell off within an hour of opening the box and will not go back on right . It also has very sharp corners .

[ia] I got this as a way to introduce my 5 year old son to the idea of shaving . He has seen me shave before , and he seemed curious about it , so this was a great tool for letting him try it out for himself safely . The shaver is great , no complaints with that . There is no razer so there 's no risk of cutting himself , it 's mostly just for wiping the shaving cream off his face . The shaving cream also says it 's soap , but I haven 't really put that to the test in any way . The brush was mostly ineffective . and the mirror is good enough to help him see what he 's doing . We haven 't used the comb yet . I think this is a good buy for any young boy who is curious about shaving .####[([39], [38], 'POS'), ([62, 63], [67, 70], 'POS'), ([110], [112, 113], 'NEG'), ([117], [119, 120], 'POS'), ([51], [53], 'POS'), ([51], [55, 57], 'POS'), ([144], [143], 'POS'), ([62, 63], [67, 70], 'POS'), ([87, 88], [93], 'POS')]
[ia] I purchased this Pizza Party kit for my 4 year old son because he always makes pizza with my husband . He loves to pretend play that he is a "Pizza man " . He uses the tray as a cash register and any left over toppings not on the pizza are his "money " . This set is very durable and can withstand a good amount of abuse from kids without breaking . However , parents with younger children should heed caution when younger children are playing with this as it can pose a choking hazard with the toppings . It would be tough for a smaller child to swallow one of the toppings but that 's not to say it can 't happen . Also , gnawing on the pieces can cause them to splinter and causes the paint to come off . Overall , I would highly recommend this product to anyone . Quality products that last are becoming hard to come by . And I foresee this being in our household for years to come .####[([58], [60, 61], 'POS'), ([100], [93, 97], 'NEG'), ([153], [150, 151], 'POS'), ([0], [169, 170], 'POS')]
[ia] Daughter was very happy with this pinata for her birthday . It held 2 pounds of candy perfectly . I bought a mix package from amazon with toys and candy that totaled 2 pounds . Pinata was strong enough to go though 10 kids once and about half way though the second round it broke . Very pretty and all the kids loved it . Also comes with durable thick plastic handle for hanging it up on the back of the unicorn .####[([7], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([0], [13, 18], 'POS'), ([36], [38, 45], 'POS'), ([0], [57, 58], 'POS'), ([0], [63], 'POS'), ([72], [69, 71], 'POS')]
[ia] The coolest thing about this cube is that you can push the different sides to have that specific instrument play in the song . It 's great for your kids learning to hear different songs .

[ia] This is a great baby toy . My boys danced to the music - it was so cute . The other two buttons have sounds or make drum beat sounds as babies bang on the top .

[ia] Great price , but my 7 month old was terrified by it . I got it because she was fascinated by a rainbowmaker she saw elsewhere . Also , there is so much static in it that few of the beads drop when you turn it over .

[ia] I bought this game for my daughter who is 3 years old . She is learning how to count and learning about sharing and taking turns . We try to minimize TV time by playing fun games at least every other night if we can . This is a fun game for her , easy , quick to learn and quick to play . It 's not long and drawn out , it 's perfect for the attention span 3 year olds have ! It 's also really cute with the lady bugs . You get a game board and the game pieces are cardboard and the lady bugs sit in little plastic stands . The each have names that go along with their color (i .e . , Olivia Orange ) . There are two seperate sets of large cards that come with the game . You take a card in this game instead of rolling dice . Instructions are simple and the game is very straightforward . I 'm sure we 'll be enjoying it for a few years to come .####[([51], [50], 'POS'), ([51], [55], 'POS'), ([51], [57, 59], 'POS'), ([51], [61, 63], 'POS'), ([0], [75, 83], 'POS'), ([0], [88, 93], 'POS'), ([160], [162], 'POS'), ([165], [168], 'POS'), ([0], [170, 176], 'POS')]
[ia] This set is perfect for both my 2 year old and 5 year old . They love "sweeping " the floor , and I no longer have to hunt down my broom !

[ia] I purchased this for my 2 1 / 2 year old son , however my 14 month old loves playing with it too . I like that the table is molded plastic and the upper tracks are permanently fixed (nothing to get lost ) ! I had to assemble the legs and upper tracks myself , however it was easy and didn 't take a long time . Applying the stickers was a l ittle more time consuming , however the directions were easy to understand and follow . The table came with a 3 piece wooden train , however most of my sons Matchbox cars fit on the tracks . This table is durable and can take the stress of both my boys climbing and sitting on it . The lid has a slick surface that is perfect for coloring on or other activities . I cannot think of a reason to not recommend this product !####[([0], [19, 20], 'POS'), ([0], [26], 'POS'), ([35, 36], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([49], [60], 'POS'), ([49], [62, 67], 'POS'), ([82], [84, 88], 'POS'), ([110], [101, 108], 'POS'), ([113], [115], 'POS'), ([157], [148, 155], 'POS'), ([69, 71], [75, 78], 'NEG')]

[ia] I bought this for my nephew and he loved it . You do have to spend 5 extra dollars to get your larvae shipped to you . It seems like that cost should be baked in to the product cost and a code provided versus having to buy them after .

[ia] My kids have played with it for less than a week and the blocks look months old . Chunks of wood missing , paint chipping , they just look nasty .

[ia] I bought this set for my two year old son with a few reservations . It is ceramic . Which is breakable . I thought for sure it was going to last for a few hours , maybe one tea party at best , but was hopeful . I wanted something he could put real liquids in . I 'm so happy I took the gamble and bought this set . It 's extremely affordable , even compared to the plastic sets . The little tea cups could hold a golf ball , but he gets a few sips out of them before they 're empty . They are very small compared to adult hands , but are a perfect fit for him . The only criticism I have for the set is that the lid for the tea pot doesn 't stay on while you pour . Everything else about it is great !####[([0], [18], 'POS'), ([0], [22], 'NEG'), ([70], [62, 66], 'POS'), ([0], [74, 75], 'POS'), ([85, 87], [89, 92], 'POS'), ([121], [120], 'POS'), ([136], [141, 147], 'NEG'), ([0], [110, 115], 'NEG'), ([0], [154], 'POS')]
[ia] I really like this game because it is not overly competitive . Since you have private goals , it is more positive than some other games that are based on pulling other players down .
