[ia] Extremely Disappointed ! I bought one these several years back and it worked fine for about 5 - 6 years and then just died but it worked well up until that time . I decided to buy another one because the old one had good enough suction for small jobs and that was all I needed it for . It had a decent battery life and with the extra battery it would work for at least 20 minutes . The new one , though , does not seem to have the same amount of suction and definitely doesn 't have hardly any battery life ! I took it off the charger and the first battery didn 't work at all and the second battery lasted only a couple of minutes . I still have the old charger and the battery that was on that one did a much better job , but there still wasn 't the same amount of suction . I would try to return it but it is impossible to take the handle apart once you put it together and then try to get it back in the box .

[ia] I use these to hang hummingbird feeders along the gutters of my garage . They are solidly constructed and work great !####[([18], [17], 'POS'), ([20], [21], 'POS')]
[ia] This sprayer is so easy to use . I paid out a lot of money for the bigger ones that have the hose sprayer attached . Had nothing but problems . With this little sprayer you just fill it , pump the thingy at the top , and press down on the triigger . No problems , have already used several times and love it !####[([2], [5, 7], 'POS'), ([0], [55, 56], 'POS'), ([0], [64, 65], 'POS')]
[ia] It is fairly easy to adjust the tubes and to drain the tubes with this . It 's a simple design but it does what it needs to do .####[([21], [20], 'NEU'), ([0], [24, 29], 'POS')]
[ia] Just waiting for the braces so we can put it on the post . It looks great so far . We 'll see what the birds think soon ! !####[([5], [1, 3], 'POS'), ([0], [16, 19], 'POS')]
[ia] Coated my lawn with this stuff after we were attacked by mosquitoes every night and our dog started coming inside with ticks - we have noticed NO improvement at all ! We also had tiny ants coming in until I got some good , old borax traps .####[([6], [26, 28], 'NEG')]
[ia] I had some other feeders that hung on the window . One needed to be replaced . This one worked perfect and it is easy to fill . Just lift the top and fill it . No need to remove it from the hanger .####[([0], [20, 21], 'POS'), ([0], [25, 27], 'POS')]
[ia] These are great to clip the weeds & grass along places you don 't want your weed -eater to mangle a border####[([0], [3, 9], 'POS')]
[ia] I must have gotten a defective one because it would not operate as advertised . I returned it and spent a little more for one of the Haws metal watering cans . Very happy now .####[([0], [6], 'NEG'), ([0], [10, 14], 'NEG')]
[ia] Good quality flags . None of the issues that some reviewers have mentioned . We 've had these flags up for about six months in a sunny location and the colors are still bright####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([0], [5, 13], 'POS'), ([31], [33, 34], 'POS')]
[ia] Strapped it to my deck railing with a zip tie to keep track of recent rainfall . Handy for when you 're away for a few days .####[([0], [18], 'POS')]
[ia] This is a good product if you are using a pool vacuum that hooks to the suction (skimmer ) side of the filter . The leaf canister uses a basket similar to a skimmer basket so I use a pool skimmer basket liner (sock ) to make the canister more effective and to help keep smaller debris out of the sand filter . I have been pleased with every Hayward product that I have purchased .####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([70, 71], [67], 'POS')]
[ia] What a beautiful flag for the money . Very well made and standout embroidered stars are a perfect touch . All stitching is outstanding and these are the longest lasting flags I have had in years . Hold up a long time in Florida sun and rain . These flags will make you proud to fly !####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([0], [9, 11], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [18, 19], 'POS'), ([22], [24], 'POS'), ([31], [29, 30], 'POS'), ([0], [38, 42], 'POS'), ([0], [51, 56], 'POS')]

[ia] I bought this just under 2 years ago . It came with charger and 2 batteries . . It usually takes both batteries power to finish up whatever i 'm doing . . I use this literally every day in my house ! I have all tile floors and 5 cats . Cats tails are like dust mops , they bring in every small stick , leaf and every thing else and deposit it across the floor . One fo the first things I do everyday is open the front door and blow out every damn thing they dragged in . Sadly with time the batteries were lasting less and less time . I charge them every day then store them in a drawer (not the hot garage ) butthey 've totaly quit charging now . So I 'll try to replace the batteries . . I 'm not even sure if I need a new charger too . . . I 'm disappointed these batteries wore out so quickly . ' that 's too big an expense to replace so often . As for the blower itself it is very light weight and easy to use .####[([0], [35], 'POS'), ([106], [108, 112], 'NEG'), ([0], [132, 135], 'NEG'), ([166], [164], 'NEG'), ([166], [167, 170], 'NEG'), ([0], [173, 176], 'NEG'), ([0], [178, 182], 'NEG')]
[ia] This is a great 2 way connector . The faucet is always on and I have not had a leak issue . I used teflon tape when I attached the two hoses just to be on the safe side as I knew the faucet would be remaining on . One hose feeds an outdoor shower and the other is for a gardening hose . The outdoor shower line is on all the time and the water operated from directly from the shower controls . The garden hose is on only when I 'm watering it so I use the small inline switch to turn the water off and on for that line .####[([5, 7], [4], 'POS'), ([10], [12, 13], 'POS'), ([0], [17, 21], 'POS')]
[ia] This chain saw is not for huge jobs , but for cleaning out roots from beds or for sprucing up a tree which has become a bit over grown between seasons , this saw does the job . Caveat : get another battery and charger if you are really going to town on trimming branches then you won 't have to wait a few hours for the 1st battery to recharge to finish your project .####[([2, 3], [5, 8], 'NEU'), ([34], [35, 37], 'POS'), ([69, 71], [60, 66], 'NEG')]

[ia] Excellent quality , worth to pay the high price . And it 's elegant . I believe it 's weatherproof (waiting for the winter to see how this cover will work )####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([9], [4, 8], 'POS'), ([0], [14], 'POS')]
