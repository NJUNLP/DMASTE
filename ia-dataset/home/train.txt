[ia] The "slide button " controls the intensity from Off to fully On , with a small , red , adjacent LED that glows with the degree of setting . When your lamp is turned off , the LED is bright , when your lamp is fully lit , the LED is off .

[ia] I don 't have too many empirical ways to test this filter , but based on the fit and feel , I like it better than what we were using . The house had filters already installed with some extras for each register . They were very flimsy , and made of a blue plastic material . These Filtrete filters are heavier and not appear to be nearly as porous . We have folks with allergies in the family and want to make sure we 're getting the air as filtered as possible . We also have two dogs that shed , which affects the downstairs filter pretty quickly . If I see something I don 't like , I 'll come back and edit this review , but for now , I have nothing but positive assessments of these filters .

It 's easy to carry around given its 'just -right ' size . I 'm not sure that it 's easy to open with one hand since it doesn 't have a thumb pin - only the cut -outs whch aren 't as easy to get your fingers into and use as a thumb pin .

[ia] I bought this for a work at my son 's house . The corded version is fine for this DIYSer - there was no issue dragging a cord around . I did find that you will mis -fire if the gun is not perfectly square with the sheetrock . Tight areas required concentration or a mis -fire was guaranteed . But all -in -all , I went through 3 tubs of screws in two rooms . 95 % of all my problems were in the first 15 minutes . Once I learned how to work it , it worked more than just fine - it worked very well .

[ia] I grew up with a can opener like this , have fought bad can openers for years and finally ordered this can opener expecting the best , but after six weeks I am sadly disappointed . It does not grip the edge o the can , skips along the edge , and leaves a mess and an unopened can . I have resorted to using the opener on my multi -tool .

[ia] The piece that is used to stop the spinning broke the first week . I figured out how to put it back , but it broke again a few days later .

[ia] I never buy cooking stuff made from aluminum yet despite the stainless steel in the name of this product , the description says it is pure aluminum . I made an exception with this product because I have purchased so many of these cookie presses and have bent or blown out every one of them with my gluten free dough . The Marcato came highly recommended . I decided since I only used it at Christmas , I would make an exception to my no aluminum rule . Despite that I HATE its aluminum construction , the cookie press is well made and has held up to the stiff dough I use for cookies each Christmas . If only they truly used stainless steel for the construction of this press , I would be telling everyone I know to buy it . This press contains a wide variety of discs for a wide variety of cookies .

[ia] So , far I am happy with this coffee maker . Mine came with three mystery parts (see photo ) which are not covered in the tiny , eye -squinting instruction pamphlet , nor any photo or description on the box . I think will figure it out , though . * * * PS I made a few trial runs and discovered that boiling water in a glass pot requires less energy to do so than in metal pots . A lower setting gets the job done and can lower the risk of the glass pot shattering . I do remember my chemistry classes whereby removing glass , pyrex included , from high temperature quickly is enough of a shock to cause glass to shatter . So , it may take a little longer using a lower heat setting but the flavor outcome of the coffee is well worth the wait .####[([9, 10], [6], 'POS')]
[ia] I purchased my first sprayer several years ago . After it got icky from a LOT of use , I threw it out and recently purchased another .

I used it to chop onions (my biggest fear ) and used it to make tabbouleh , hummus , and baba ghannoush . I literally used it every single day and loved it so much . I am giving it 2 stars now cause it stopped working after one year . So , I 'm returning the item and will write to the company to inform them .

[ia] I love this t ea kettle , but it is so hard to find .

[ia] My favoite way to make popcorn If you use flavoring you need to change the Power Cups quite often . We generally use real butter added after poping so the Power Cups last 6 to 10 uses .

[ia] Super skillet and you sure cannot be the price ! We tend to dump out Teflon skillet every so often because they just don 't have the staying power . This skillet is not some lightweight cheaply made one . The construction is solid . I was shocked by the weight . While this impressed me , anyone with weak wrists may take that into consideration .

[ia] This is the way to make coffee ! Simple , straightforward , and probably the most "Green " method out there . 5 total parts - 3 main ones are almost unbreakable , the filter and gasket you may have to replace . . But seldom . Most important it makes great coffee and is usable with a vast array of coffee varieties . One note , grinding the beans specifically for a MOKA pot is important for the best quality brew .

[ia] It was so banged up that the lid would not open and I could not push it out . I do not think it was the shipping issue since packaging and the box it was in looked perfectly fine . I think the manufacturer placed defective , banged up bread box inside the box . Also , the description extolled its flat top that could be purportedly used to store more stuff on top . No way . It is so flimsy , it seems like even a piece of bread on top of the box will dent it . And it also seems super large in size . I am surprised people say it is a great box for a small kitchen .

[ia] It is a wonderful grill for 1 or 2 people , if you don 't have a fancy cooktop or range that comes with a grill . I used it to make salmon teriyaki and the salmon came out real tender on the inside , with a nice grilled flavor . Cleaning is not too bad either as the nonstick surface seems to be permanently in tact . The only thing I wondered about this grill is why the drip pan was a flimsy white plastic and not aluminum or stainless steel . Although oil cools fast , I found myself worrying that the plastic would melt as soon as the oil dripped onto it . But of course it didn 't and the drip pan cleaned well , so I can 't give minus points for this one . . . !####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([52], [54, 56], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [65, 67], 'POS'), ([80, 81], [84, 86], 'NEG'), ([125, 126], [127, 128], 'POS')]

[ia] I purchased these scoops , which are available from Norpro in five sizes , to use for a variety of kitchen tasks : ice cream scooping , portion serving , meatball shaping , and , most importantly , cookie baking ! In my opinion , no kitchen should be without a set of these . They appear to be nicely made and seem to be of sufficient sturdiness that they will last a long time .

[ia] I don 't have pets but this vacuum cleaner works well on my wall to wall carpets , floors , and furniture . The floor attachment is a little awkward to move around (especially in corners ) and it only has a small opening , but the suction power is very good . The blower feature is not what I expected . Using it requires detaching the hose and the HEPA filter and reattaching the hose to the back of the unit . After all that it doesn 't expel enough power to dust or do anything significant . I like the adjustable rod and the 20ft cord length . Its lightweight and compact so its easy to store .

[ia] It totally works . A lot of people complained about this product in their reviews but I think they simply over -wound it and broke it . Make sure you stop winding once you feel the resistance .

No where in the details on Amazon did I see the warning that the pot melts ! !

But if something sudden happens , for example , a child gets hurt and you run to help and forget to turn the pot off , you do not have a burned on mess , you have a melted pot . Who wants that ?

[ia] Finally found something that works to break up and brown ground beef ! Although not actually a fork , this tool is strong enough to do the job without bending out of shape , and actually works faster and easier than the old , truly sturdy , 3 tine granny fork . I had a 3 tine cooking fork for over 25 years that I used for everything , until the handle broke , and since it wasn 't full tang , I couldn 't replace the handle . I 've searched for years for another 3 tine fork , but the ones I 've found just aren 't made like they used to be . They work fine for turning light -weight meat or testing potatoes , but try to break up and brown ground beef and they 'll bend , tines and tang ! This tool is strong , but has just enough flex to manipulate well . The tines look odd because they are made slightly offset , but the shape makes them work more efficiently . Just got the granny fork yesterday , and after one use I was very impressed with it . I can see already that I will be using it for a lot more than just browning ground beef .

[ia] I just received my waffle iron today and used it as soon as it arrived . I 've never owned a waffle iron so I can 't compare it to another one . However this waffle iron made the most delicious waffles ever . I used 3 / 4 cup and it was the perfect amount . The first one I let cook for 5 minutes and 30 seconds and it was overcooked not soft at all almost like a toast . The second one I let cook for exactly 3 minutes and 40 seconds and it was chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside but not too crunchy . It takes a few times to find out the exact time to get the waffles to your liking . I didn 't spray the waffle iron and they came out with ease . I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to anyone .

[ia] Buying a watering can was more work than I expected . I probably spent at least an hour reading reviews of different watering cans . It was worth it . This is a great watering can .

The diffuser that fits on the end of the spout is easily removed (and then put back on the spout ) if you want a simple stream of water .

[ia] We built a chicken coop in our backyard earlier this year and noticed that we started getting more flies as the weather got warmer . Since the coop isn 't too far away from our deck and grill , it became increasingly annoying to do anything near our favorite spots . We purchased this product after reading many reviews and are certainly glad we did . We hung the trap with butcher 's twine after filling with water as instructed . We decided to place the trap behind our shed and closer to our compost bin rather than hanging directly onto the coop itself . The smell that emits after a few days is quite strong with the right wind . We didn 't notice any smells otherwise , I 'd say because of its placement behind the shed .

[ia] This is the most effective insect repellent I have used so far this year . Live in a country setting so have tons of insects like mosquitoes , mites , ants , fleas , etc . There has been a lot of rain lately which brings out those pesky mosquitoes . After spraying around the house and yard , the pests are gone . With winter coming shortly , insects tend to find refuge in the house and so want to catch them before they find ways inside .

[ia] The bag attaches to the vacuum by means of a plastic fitting that comes with the original unit . Taking the fitting from the old bad and installing it on the new one is easy .

This stuff really reeks - I guess it has to , to draw in the flies . Stand back when you open the container : - ) Painting it on as per instructions did not work so well - I recommend bait stations instead .

Even when they can get into the small feeding space they can 't hold on to the slick plastic .

[ia] Not thrilled at all . While the plastic is attractive enough , once constructed it is too wobbly for our taste .

[ia] This is a great substitute for anyone that wants a grill but can 't have a propane , or gas fired grill . We were living in an apartment complex that had a common gas grill , but it was a little far from our actual apartment , so not very convenient .

Just turn the main water feed off , open the valve on this splitter going to the hose , then open the free valve , which bleeds any pressure from the hose .

[ia] I have a mature Concord Grape Vine in my backyard . In the summer of 2013 it came down with black rot which destroyed the fruit and leaves . In 2014 the same thing happened .

Next , Mancozeb was applied once in April and of May of 2015 . I stopped once the fruit started appearing . Then a problem appeared in the beginning of June : reddish rust spots on the leaves which was black rot . The reason this happened was because of rainfall .

On the negative side , since it mounts on a deck railing , it might be higher than your local birds are used to looking for water . It took several weeks for our birds to discover and start using it .

[ia] I haven 't actually used this yet but I did plug it in to make sure it worked . It was missing a part - the drip tray - and I had to call the 800 number to order one . It took almost 2 weeks to get to me but DID get here . . . . . . Not Amazon 's fault . Seems well built and I am looking forward to using it . I bought it for my camping trips .####[([27, 28], [22], 'NEG'), ([0], [43, 50], 'NEU'), ([0], [66, 68], 'POS'), ([0], [72, 75], 'POS')]
[ia] I 'm in love with a shovel ! I use it just about every day of the week to add soil to the garden , fertilizer and just about anything that requires a larger surface than your typical shovel . It 's so useful and has a great grip . Thank you !####[([7], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([0], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([49], [48], 'POS'), ([0], [51, 52], 'POS')]
[ia] Stores your seat cushions or BBQ supplies and also provides seating for one more ! Ours stays out year 'round and after a few years still washed up easily and looks good . It 's not bug proof however , so I put the cushions in a trash bag and spray some home defense bug spray inside once in awhile .####[([0], [1, 7], 'POS'), ([0], [10, 11], 'POS'), ([0], [17, 20], 'POS'), ([0], [27, 29], 'POS'), ([31], [32], 'POS'), ([0], [36, 38], 'NEG')]
[ia] I have never used a better mouse trap . Silent , mess free , the other mice don 't see what is going on and do not get afraid of it . I literally caught 2 mice in one night with this thing (check in the middle of the night , saw it was triggered , cleared and reset ) . I have caught 7 mice in it so far , I bait with soy nut butter . Works every time !####[([0], [10], 'POS'), ([0], [12, 13], 'POS'), ([79], [80, 81], 'POS')]
[ia] Really love this humming bird feeder , so easy to clean and stay bug free , I 'm very happy with my purschase####[([4, 6], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([4, 6], [8, 11], 'POS'), ([4, 6], [13, 15], 'POS'), ([23], [19, 20], 'POS')]
[ia] Or so I found out after moving here from the upper mid -west . Works good and as advertised . Arrived in prompt fashion . My only suggestion would be a better way to put two of the 10 ' X20 ' together OR make a 20 'X20 ' So I can cover my citrus trees easier .####[([15], [16], 'POS'), ([0], [18, 19], 'POS'), ([0], [21, 24], 'POS')]
[ia] Purchased this to hang on our new flag pole ; should last a couple of seasons as the flag is well constructed given the price . If you 're looking for something less expensive (maybe you change out your flags regularly or only need it for a special occasion ) I recommend this one .####[([22], [21], 'POS'), ([0], [51, 52], 'POS')]
[ia] Love that it 's printed on both sides . Colors are vibrant . I haven 't had it for long , but it looks durable .####[([5, 8], [1], 'POS'), ([10], [12], 'POS'), ([24], [25], 'POS')]
[ia] A fine little portable grill . The handling of ashes is awkward and messy . Expect to step up to a more expensive version that has an ash catcher .####[([5], [2], 'POS'), ([5], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([8, 10], [12], 'NEG'), ([8, 10], [14], 'NEG')]
[ia] This item looks and works great . I am only giving it three stars because of the items description . This item is copper plated metal ,not pure copper . On the box are the words Cosmix and Red Carpet Studios . Same Company as Cosmix Helix ?####[([3], [6], 'POS'), ([5], [6], 'POS'), ([22], [24, 29], 'NEG')]
[ia] Perfect for deer barrier around my little garden . lightweight but very hard to rip . Best of all it 's almost invisible to passers by ! ! Last year my garden was raided by deer . This year they are going to have to find another garden to devour !####[([0], [1, 4], 'POS'), ([0], [10], 'POS'), ([0], [12, 15], 'POS'), ([0], [22, 26], 'POS')]
[ia] I t arrived on time without any problems ! As soon as I received it I put it up out side and it is still working outside !####[([3], [4, 8], 'POS'), ([0], [25, 27], 'POS')]
[ia] I am very new to the smoking process . Ive done ribs and tri tips so far and both have come out perfectly cooked and flavored . Couldn 't ask for a better smoker to get you started in the smoking of meats .####[([34], [28, 33], 'POS')]
[ia] Residential back yard with a covenant limited 4 foot wood fence and a very large Great Pyrenees dog . I wanted to ensure he would not get his paws caught if he attempted to put them up on the top of the fence and also make sure he could not get leverage on the fence to get himself up and over the top . Put this up one afternoon and ran a single wire around the yard . Works great . There have been no issues and he appears to be happy with the arrangement . Don 't know if he ever touched the wire . I did spend a bit of time warning him away from the fence and while he gets near it , he has not been seen trying to stand up on it . It does not keep squirrels out of the yard however - then don 't get a shock because they are not grounded when going over /under the wire .####[([79], [80], 'POS'), ([0], [85, 86], 'POS'), ([0], [140, 147], 'NEU')]
[ia] I have a large potted plant that I needed this for . Looks dec ent and is sturdy , I will probably looking at other sizes####[([13], [15], 'POS'), ([0], [18], 'POS')]
[ia] This trap was the most unsuccessful trap of the three I own . Lasted one season then parts started snapping off . There are better traps and I usually like Victor traps .####[([7], [5, 6], 'NEG'), ([0], [14, 16], 'NEG'), ([18], [20, 21], 'NEG'), ([31, 32], [30], 'POS')]
[ia] difficult to see that skinny arm from 8 feet away , where is where it 's located on the deck . they could have made the arm twice as wide and still keep the end of the stylus narrow . Update : now it been outside 6 months and the fading is horrific . can only read up to 80 degrees the 100 and 120 have disappeared . the same for the hygrometer which is grossly inaccurate . I should get a refund for defective product but it faded after 60 days !####[([6], [1, 5], 'NEG'), ([51], [53], 'NEG'), ([73], [76, 77], 'NEG'), ([86], [80, 85], 'NEG'), ([0], [89, 92], 'NEG')]
[ia] Access to the seed through the wires is on the small side . Larger birds can 't get through . This is better for sparrows , finch , juvenile cardinals . It DOES keep the squirrels out but it won 't feed the entire bird population and I 'm left to put up another feeder to please all .####[([0], [14, 19], 'NEU'), ([0], [40, 46], 'NEG'), ([0], [33, 37], 'POS')]
[ia] Larger rat zapper needed for pack rats . I reviewed the larger black rat zapper and it was great killin 2 rats right away . It was left outside and the rain destroyed it . To save money I purchased the smaller blue rat zapper . Took smaller batteries and was not successful killing the rats . If you have small mice rzcoo1 is probably fine even with less battery power . I agree with comments that fresh batteries are nec for even the first kill . This is more of a mouse zapper than a rat zapper . I will be getting the bigger one again####[([0], [52, 53], 'NEG'), ([0], [65, 71], 'NEU')]
[ia] Had to return two of these . Both were ripped when they arrived even though they were supposed to be new .####[([0], [1, 3], 'NEG'), ([0], [10], 'NEG')]

[ia] While this feeder did attract birds , it fell off the window a few times despite the tricks I know to keep suction cups in place . Became too much of a hassle for me .####[([0], [28, 35], 'NEG'), ([3], [9, 15], 'NEG')]
[ia] The sprayer stopped spraying after less than two minutes of use . Update : 11 / 15 ordered four additional containers ; the sprayers worked great but the content were not effective .####[([2], [3, 4], 'NEG'), ([24], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([29], [31, 32], 'NEG')]
[ia] Way toooooo cute to waste on birds & their nasty housekeeping , we turned ours into a nite lite , adorable !####[([0], [2, 3], 'POS')]
