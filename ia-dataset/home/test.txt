The recycle of the tank pressure (which I set @ 110psi ) easily operates any of these tools without a need to wait for the pressure to build .

[ia] This router table sounds like a good idea , but because the whole thing is plastic , it flexes too much for any type of work that requires a router bit .

I had my husband pound them til the handles were flat and straight . Now they are usable . I am still not fond of them , as they feel unbalanced or something , when I use them , but will do . The only reason they got 2 stars instead of one star is because they did not rust first time I put them in the dishwasher .

[ia] You fill it half way , put on the top and then you use the top cap to pump and pump till you build up pressure inside the lower chamber . When you then take off the cap it sprays very fine like PAM spray . You really can 't replicate this any other way and the result is probably better for cooking . Once pumped up you can 't fit the cap down again unless you relieve the pressure . That is one problem . It also hasn 't broken but it 's very light and I suspect it may have a limited lifespan .

[ia] Amazingly well constructed , exceeded expectations , and is so easy to use - clean - store . I almost did not order , based upon a few recent negative reviews about the power level . After my scientist -engineer brain kicked in and ran a few calc 's to determine the calculated heat at 120 -volts versus 110 -volts , I realized that they may not have been following manufacturers recommendations . The problem they most likely were having was operating at 110 -volts rather than the REQUIRED 120 -volts . The manual clearly and in bold states that you MUST operate at 120volts to obtain full temperature . "Run , don 't walk " to purchase this unit , as it is perfect for a 2 - 4 person family .

[ia] There are several things I like about this holder ; the size , the holes for drainage , that one side is deeper than the other , that the center comes off for cleaning .

It might be better if the middle piece didn 't come off because that 's the place I have the most trouble keeping clean . I use one side to hold my sponge and the other side to hold my stainless steel scrubbie for cleaning my cast iron cookware . I clean it every time I wash up things in the sink so at least daily and it still tries to get that nasty red mold growing in the bottom . In ONE DAY !

The thing I like about these is they are 3 / 4 in ID and water volume is greatly enhanced over a 5 /8 inch hose . I typically use 2 one hundred foot hoses hooked together . Two 5 /8 inch hoses hooked together give a minimal amount of water flow . A three -quarter inch hose hooked on to the source and then with a 5 /8 inch hose attached to it give significantly better water pressure . Two three quarter inch hoses hooked together is like using a water cannon . Overall I 've been very impressed with the quality of these hoses . However they are not a non Kink hose .

[ia] I bought this mower because I didn 't want to deal with gasoline and the heavy weight of a power mower . Also because I 'm cheap and figured this was a way to spend less on my lawn and get a workout at the same time . My lawn is not too large , maybe 20 x 50 feet . The grass is fairly soft and thin . The mower cuts most of the grass reasonably well , but because the grass is soft and thin , it will sometimes miss blades that get pushed down by the wheels . This means I sometimes have to come back through with a rake to get the grass to stand up high enough to cut . When I 'm done mowing , it never gets that really clean look that a power mower will give you . Maybe it 's just something I have to get used to . The blades frequently jam on small twigs , which is a bit of a pain . To clear the jam , I tilt the mower sideways until it dislodges . I also wish the blades got closer to the edges of the lawn .

This grill is made properly , and has been coated well with baked -on enamel paint ; should offer you years of use . I would recommend you spend the extra $ 10 and get the "Smokey Joe Gold " , over the "silver " model , simply because it comes with a chrome metal curved rod attachment that serves to lock the lid in place so you 're able to cary the WHOLE GRILL around , by the handle . This feature also helps while in transit , or when being stowed , which can prevent used ashes from being spilled . Also , this feature creates a place to rest the lid , when being used .

[ia] Could not use it for very long . Used it one day not even for 10 minutes . We have a well pump and the fine particles plugged up the fine holes of the nozzle which made it unusable .####[([0], [1, 7], 'NEG')]
[ia] I WAS going to put this clock out on my patio , until I took it out of the box and actually saw it in real time ; it is now proudly displayed in my TV room ! ~ Excellent timepiece for the money it cost and very accurate ! ~ Highly recommended !####[([0], [32, 33], 'POS'), ([41], [40], 'POS'), ([41], [48, 49], 'POS'), ([0], [52, 53], 'POS')]
[ia] It is getting harder and harder to find nozzles like this that have infinately variable spray , ranging from a fan to a steady stream just by squeezing the lever . Most new ones require you to twist a nozzel on the end . . .which is a waste of time when washing a car . I have used this before . I have 3 worn out ones in my garage . I was happy to see they have a lifetime warranty which I did not know . The picture does not show it , but it has a nozzel shield surrounding the threads on the spray end . Helpful in case it falls up against a fender ! Works great .####[([0], [79, 82], 'POS'), ([120], [121], 'POS'), ([0], [110], 'POS')]
[ia] I have been looking for a hose end that would last longer than it took to get out of the package . This one looks like it might be the one . It is heavy duty and has a smooth on /off action . Fingers crossed for next year !####[([0], [35, 36], 'POS'), ([41, 43], [40], 'POS')]
[ia] Gardeners ' Want It All : ' a single product that banishes all bugs and molds and fungi , while being environmentally friendly and Organic . Safer is the closest product we have had throughout my (long ) lifetime that ticks off most of these boxes . Spray vegetables with it and you can harvest as early as a day later . Plants DO get relief from many pests . Slugs and Tomato Horn -worms are not among them but this broad -spectrum , plant friendly pesticide ' pulls its weight ' in my garden year after year . The pre -mix bottles with their 'kitchen -familiar ' spray nozzle and handle is easy to use IF you have only a few precious plants to protect . I have used the very fine quality copper vinyard sprayers . . .but I would rather tote a series of these than a tankful from that sprayer for the raised bed 'allotment ' garden I have these days .

[ia] Works perfectly for my needs . We have been harnessing the water cast off by the AC in a very humid climac and are using it to water a small vegetable garden . The garden is an estimated 25 yards from the water source and I began looking for a solution to carry a decent amount and spray the garden . This spray wagon works perfectly for this . So far I have only used the sprayer it cam equipped with . If I had a need to spray other liquids over a large area this is what I would choose . This wagon has been easy to maneuver over the grassy yard even when damp from the rain .

[ia] These work in the deep south . Was using the donuts but started having a problem with magnolia tree leaves . They are like little cups when they fall . They really hold on to the water . So a general broadcast of this stuff seemed to help tremendously Also works well in water catchers . Will not harm goldfish in ponds . Probably would be good in gutters also . Will need to work on that next year . Can do a general broadcast under bushes where mosquitoes hide .####[([0], [32, 37], 'POS'), ([45], [46, 49], 'POS'), ([51], [52], 'POS'), ([0], [57, 62], 'POS')]

[ia] We have several acres in walnuts on our property and fight an endless battle with the ground squirrels which are very plentiful in our area . Used aggressively and diligently these gassers work pretty well . There are other ones sold which have less than half as much material in them , and those ones don 't work worth a darn . The hard part is making sure the squirrel is home when you do the job . The best way is to gas the hole right after you see a squirrel go in it . Follow the directions .####[([33], [34, 35], 'POS')]

[ia] This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit . Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low .

If you want to know the temperature , I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $ 10 , including prime shipping , Reed MM2 Max -Min Analog Thermometer , -40 to 120 Degrees F .

Got the 8 - 1 /2 " X 11 " DD coil for it for Christmas and that has helped but still trying to get used to the false pings when swinging this in the dry sand near the beach .

[ia] Been using this type shovel for years , lightweight , will not rust , great for moving snow . Everyone is sold out of shovels of this type because of the frequent snow storms . During the last storm my daughter broke her shovel so I gave her my spare grain hog scoop # 12 shovel . AMAZON had the type shovel I was looking for . I ordered two , one for dad , one for daughter . They arrived with the shovel scoop protected by a flattened cardboard box . Gave the scoop a coat of furniture polish , helps the snow to slide off . YUP 10 " of snow for tonight , the shovels arrived just in time . Very thankful that AMAZON had a supply of these shovels . So far this shovel has not cracked , perhaps the cold causes the scoop material to become brittle - do not know .
